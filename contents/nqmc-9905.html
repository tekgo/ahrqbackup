Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of prescriptions for chronic medications for patients 18 years and older electronically prescribed (e-prescribed) by a prescriber and not obtained by the patient in the following 30 days. </p>
<p>This rate measures the level of primary medication non-adherence (PMN) across a population of patients. The unit of measure is a pharmacy or network of pharmacies. It is not intended for use by pharmacy benefit managers or health plans, as the data required is not available in administrative claims. </p>
<p><strong>Data Requirements</strong>. To calculate this measure, pharmacy prescription dispensing data must be available. The pharmacy prescription dispensing data must include a field for prescription origin or be linked to an e-prescribing system to identify e-prescriptions. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Non-adherence to essential medications is an important public health problem. Medication non-adherence is related to greater morbidity and mortality in chronic disease, and has been estimated to increase healthcare costs by over $170 billion annually in the United States (Ho et al., "Effect of medication," 2006; Ho et al., "Impact of medication," 2006; Sokol et al., 2005; National Council on Patient Information and Education, 2007). As the use of electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) increases, primary medication non-adherence (PMN) is receiving more attention because e-prescribing could provide reliable ways to measure initiation of therapy. A recent study found a 28% rate of PMN with differences among classes of drugs (Fischer et al., 2010).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure was pilot tested during measure development (see process below), which included reliability and validity testing.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) Measure Development Process</strong></p>
<p>PQA develops performance measures through a consensus-driven process to draft, test, refine and endorse measures of medication-use quality. </p>
<p>Step 1: PQA workgroups comprised of experts in all phases of drug use and management identify measure concepts that may be appropriate for development into fully specified performance measures or indicators for organizational internal quality improvement. The workgroups focus on specific aspects of the medication-use system and/or specific therapeutic areas. </p>
<p>Step 2: PQA workgroups recommend measure concepts to the PQA Quality Metrics Expert Panel (QMEP) for evaluation and refinement. The QMEP reviews the measure concepts to provide an initial assessment of the key properties of performance measures (i.e., feasibility, usability and scientific validity). The measure concepts that are rated highly on these key properties will undergo technical specification as draft measures. </p>
<p>Step 3: The draft measures are provided to PQA member organizations for their comments prior to preparing technical specifications for pilot testing. PQA staff use member comments and workgroup and QMEP recommendations to formulate a testing plan for each draft measure. </p>
<p>Step 4: PQA selects partners to test the draft measures. These partners are often PQA member health plans or academic institutions with expertise in quality and performance measure testing. The testing partner implements the draft technical specifications within their existing datasets and provides a report to PQA that details testing results and recommendations for modifications of the technical specifications. </p>
<p>Step 5: The workgroup that developed the measure reviews the testing results and provides comment. The QMEP reviews the workgroup comments, testing results, recommendations and potential modifications and provides a final assessment of the feasibility and scientific validity of the draft performance measures. </p>
<p>Step 6: Measures that are recommended by the QMEP for endorsement are posted on the PQA web site for member review, written comments are requested, and a conference call for member organizations is held to gather feedback and address any questions. This process allows members to discuss their views on the measures in advance of the voting period. </p>
<p>Step 7: PQA member organizations vote on endorsement of the Performance Measures and approval of Quality Improvement Indicators. </p></div>
