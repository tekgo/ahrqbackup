<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral cervical spine radiography or high-resolution CT is recommended to assess the cervical spine in children &lt;9 years of age. </li>
    <li>AP, lateral, and open-mouth cervical spine radiography or high-resolution CT is recommended to assess the cervical spine in children &gt;9 years of age. </li>
    <li>High-resolution CT scan with attention to the suspected level of neurological injury is recommended to exclude occult fractures or to evaluate regions not adequately visualized on plain radiographs. </li>
    <li>Flexion and extension cervical radiographs or fluoroscopy are recommended to exclude gross ligamentous instability when there remains a suspicion of cervical spinal instability following static radiographs or CT scan. </li>
    <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine is recommended to exclude spinal cord or nerve root compression, evaluate ligamentous integrity, or provide information regarding neurological prognosis. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p><em>Level III</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Thoracic elevation or an occipital recess is recommended in children &lt;8 years of age to prevent flexion of the head and neck when restrained supine on an otherwise flat backboard for better neutral alignment and immobilization of the cervical spine. </li>
    <li>Closed reduction and halo immobilization are recommended for injuries of the C2 synchondrosis in children &lt;7 years of age. </li>
    <li>Reduction with manipulation or halter traction is recommended for patients with acute AARF (&lt;4 weeks duration) that does not reduce spontaneously. Reduction with halter or tong/halo traction is recommended for patients with chronic AARF (&gt;4 weeks duration). </li>
    <li>Internal fixation and fusion are recommended in patients with recurrent and/or irreducible AARF. </li>
    <li>Consideration of primary operative therapy is recommended for isolated ligamentous injuries of the cervical spine and unstable or irreducible fractures or dislocations with associated deformity. </li>
    <li>Operative therapy is recommended for cervical spine injuries that fail non-operative management. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>The available medical literature supports only 1 <strong>Level I</strong> recommendation for the management of pediatric patients with cervical spine or spinal cord injuries, specifically related to the diagnosis of patients with potential AOD. <strong>Level II</strong> and <strong>III</strong> diagnostic and <strong>Level III</strong> treatment recommendations are supported by the remaining medical evidence. The literature suggests that obtaining neutral cervical spine alignment in a child may be difficult when standard backboards are used. The determination that a child does not have a cervical spine injury can be made on clinical grounds alone is supported by <strong>Class II</strong> and <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence. When the child is alert and communicative and is without neurological deficit, neck tenderness, painful distracting injury, or intoxication, cervical radiographs are not necessary to exclude cervical spinal injury. When cervical spine radiographs are utilized to verify or rule out a cervical spinal injury in children &lt;9 years of age, only lateral and AP cervical spine views need be obtained. The traditional 3-view x-ray assessment may increase the sensitivity of plain spine radiographs in children &gt;9 years of age. High resolution CT scan of the cervical spine provides more than adequate visualization of the cervical spine, but is not necessary in most children. CT and MRI are most appropriately used in selected cases to provide additional diagnostic information regarding a known or suspected injury (e.g., CT for AOD) or to further assess the spine/spinal cord in an obtunded child. The vast majority of pediatric cervical spine injuries can be effectively treated non-operatively. The most effective immobilization appears to be accomplished with either halo devices or Minerva jackets. Halo immobilization is associated with acceptable but considerable minor morbidity in children, typically pin site infection and pin loosening. The only specific pediatric cervical spine injury for which medical evidence supports a particular treatment paradigm is an odontoid injury in children &lt;7 years of age. These children are effectively treated with closed reduction and immobilization. Primarily ligamentous injuries of the cervical spine in children may heal with external immobilization alone, but are associated with a relatively high rate of persistent or progressive deformity when treated non-operatively. Pharmacological therapy and intensive care unit management schemes for children with spinal cord injuries have not been described in the literature.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Incorporating and expanding upon the first iteration of these guidelines, a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search from 1966 to 2011 was undertaken using Medical Subject Headings in combination with "spinal cord injuries" and "child" and yielded 1125 citations. These citations were reviewed in combination with "cervical vertebra," "spinal injuries," and "child" which yielded 197 citations. Non-English language citations were deleted. The remaining abstracts were reviewed for those that described children who had sustained or were being evaluated for a cervical spinal cord or cervical spinal column injury. Articles describing the clinical aspects and management of children were used to generate these guidelines. Case reports were excluded. Of the 80 articles meeting selection criteria, 1 provided Class I medical evidence for diagnostic imaging in atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD). In addition, there were 10 Class II medical evidence studies addressing diagnostic imaging in children. There was only 1 Class II medical evidence study concerning treatment. All remaining articles were case series representing Class III medical evidence.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Selected articles were carefully reviewed by the authors. Evidentiary tables were created (refer to Tables 1 and 2 in the original guideline document) that reflected the strengths and weaknesses of each article.</p>
<p>On occasion, the assessed quality of the study design was so contentious and the conclusions so uncertain that the guideline authors assigned a lower medical evidence classification than might have been expected without such a detailed review. In every way, adherence to the Institute of Medicine's criteria for searching, assembling, evaluating, and weighing the available medical evidence and linking it to the strength of the recommendations presented in this document was carried out.</p>
<p>Articles that did not achieve immediate consensus among the author group were discussed extensively until a consensus was reached. Very few contributions required extensive discussion. Most articles were easily designated as containing Class I, II, or III medical evidence using the criteria set forth by the author group at the initiation of the literature evaluation process (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
