<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>State health agencies, which are vested with the legal authority to require disease reporting and collect health data, play a central role in public health surveillance. Whereas public health surveillance was once focused primarily on infectious diseases, it has expanded in recent years to include surveillance of a wide range of health outcomes and their determinants, including chronic diseases, injuries and health behaviors (Halperin &amp; Horan, 1998). National statistics on occupational injuries and illnesses have been collected largely outside of the public health infrastructure and rely almost entirely on data reported by employers. State health agencies that have access to a wide variety of public health data systems have an important role in the surveillance of occupational diseases, injuries and hazards.</p>
<p>Acute work-related trauma is a leading cause of death and disability among U.S. workers. Changes in hospitalization practices and workers' compensation coverage/reporting may increasingly reduce capture of minor injuries but have little effect on severe injuries. Use of a severity threshold can decrease the impact of changing utilization and service delivery patterns on observed injury trends (Cryer &amp; Langley, 2008; National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS] Expert Group on Injury Severity Measurement, 2004). When hospitalization data are used to calculate occupational injury trends in the absence of severity restriction, observed trends are biased downward (Sears, Bowman, &amp; Hogg-Johnson, 2014). Accurate characterization of injury trends is critical to understanding how we are doing as a nation with regard to occupational injury prevention.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Acute work-related trauma is a leading cause of death and disability for U.S. workers. In 2010, more than 4,500 U.S. workers died from occupational injuries (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH], 2012). Severe traumatic injury can lead to long-term pain and disability and is very costly for workers' compensation systems and society as a whole. The total national medical and productivity cost for occupational injuries was recently estimated at $192 billion annually (Leigh, 2011).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 1998, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), in association with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), convened the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group to make recommendations to NIOSH concerning State-based surveillance activities for the coming decade. </p>
<p>The Work Group recognized the need to pilot test 19 indicators to assess the feasibility of widespread implementation and to develop specific guidance on how to compute the proposed measures. In summer 2002, the five "Core" states with NIOSH Cooperative Agreements to conduct "Core Occupational Health Surveillance" (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Washington) agreed to pilot test the indicators and to create user-friendly "how-to" guides so that other states could calculate the indicators. </p>
<p>Subsequent to the initial pilot testing by the five "Core" states, eight additional states (Connecticut, Maine, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin) pilot tested the "how-to" guides. Feedback from these additional states was incorporated into the development of the final "how-to" guides for 19 indicators in November 2004.</p>
<p>Procedures to review, approve, and implement new indicators were developed by the Work Group. In 2013, a fourteenth health effect indicator (<em>Asthma among Adults Caused or Made Worse by Work</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-first indicator. In 2014, a fifteenth health effect indicator (<em>Work-Related Severe Traumatic Injury Hospitalizations</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-second indicator. </p></div>
