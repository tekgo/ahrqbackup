<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess adult enrollees' overall rating of their specialist. Enrollees rate the specialist they saw most often on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst specialist possible and 10 is the best specialist possible. </p>
<p>This measure is based on the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0 (Adult Questionnaire). Please note that there is another version of the survey available: <a href="https://www.cahps.ahrq.gov/surveys-guidance/hp/instructions/index.html" title="CAHPS Web site" target="_blank">CAHPS Health Plan Survey 4.0 (Adult Questionnaire)</a>.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Responses are grouped by rating: percentages are reported for ratings of 9 and 10, 7 and 8, and 6 and lower. The higher the percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 is associated with better quality.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The CAHPS Health Plan Survey is a tool for collecting standardized information on enrollees' experiences with health plans and their services. Since its launch in 1997, this survey has become the national standard for measuring and reporting on the experiences of consumers with their health plans. A version of this survey is conducted in almost every state in the United States (U.S.). </p>
<p>The National Quality Forum (NQF)-endorsed Health Plan Survey includes standardized questionnaires and optional supplemental items that can be administered to adults and children in commercial plans and Medicaid plans and programs. To be accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, health plans must submit the results of a modified version of the commercial questionnaire. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services also administers a version of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey designed for Medicare beneficiaries. </p>
<p>The Health Plan Survey asks enrollees about their recent experiences with health plans and their services. This standardized survey was designed to support consumers in assessing the performance of health plans and choosing the plans that best meet their needs. Health plans can also use the survey results to identify their strengths and weaknesses and target areas for improvement.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In May 2012, the CAHPS Consortium released the 5.0 version of the Health Plan Surveys. This update applies recent improvements in survey design that resulted from testing of the Clinician &amp; Group Surveys. </p>
<p>Development of the CAHPS Health Plan Surveys included:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Cognitive testing</strong>. In order to determine whether the questionnaire items were understandable and meaningful to respondents, the CAHPS Consortium and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) submitted the draft of the Health Plan Survey 4.0 to multiple rounds of cognitive testing starting in December 2004. This testing helped survey developers choose the most accurate and accessible language in English and Spanish for each question included in the survey. </li>
    <li><strong>Field testing</strong>. Once the Consortium had incorporated findings from cognitive testing into the draft instrument, they moved on to the field testing stage. Working closely again with NCQA, they submitted the instrument to field tests at six geographically diverse sites in the spring of 2005, analyzed the field test data, and revised the instrument as needed. </li>
