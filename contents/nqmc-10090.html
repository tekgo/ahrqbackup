Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who reported how often they were able to get needed care. </p>
<p>The "Getting Needed Care" composite measure is based on five items on the CAHPS American Indian Survey. Four questions ask patients how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always"):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>How often patient got the medical help or advice needed after regular hours </li>
    <li>How often patient got the medical help or advice needed </li>
    <li>How often it was easy to get the care, tests or treatment the patient needed </li>
    <li>How often patient got the prescription medicine needed through clinic </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>One question asks patients whether ("Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," or "No"):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Ease of getting prescription medicine needed through provider </li>
</ul></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In collaboration with the Choctaw Nation Health Services (CNHS), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and RAND Corporation developed the American Indian Survey to allow the CNHS and other tribal populations to assess patients' experiences with Indian health care facilities. These partners recognized the importance of developing a survey that could be used to measure patient experience of care for a population that was vulnerable, traditionally under-served, and had higher rates of poor health outcomes than the U.S. non-Hispanic White population.</p>
<p>The CAHPS American Indian Survey is used for these purposes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>To collect and measure patient experience of care, </li>
    <li>To help American Indian tribes make valid comparisons across tribal outpatient clinics; and </li>
    <li>To support the clinics in their efforts to evaluate the need for internal quality improvements. </li>
</ol>
<p>In order to meet the circumstances and needs of the American Indian population, the survey's measures reflect how health services are organized and delivered in tribal clinics. Survey items are reworded from the CAHPS Clinician and Group Survey to include terms or phrases familiar to the CNHS/Indian patient population. For example, the term health professional was substituted for the term health provider as the former was more widely used and recognized by CNHS patients. Additionally, the survey includes items on perceived discrimination due to the evidence that Native Americans are less likely to trust health care providers, clinics, and hospitals than non-Hispanic Whites.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Development of the CAHPS American Indian Survey included:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Cognitive testing</strong>. In the summer of 2004, the RAND members of the CAHPS team conducted cognitive testing of the first draft of the CAHPS American Indian Survey with 20 subjects recruited from 3 Choctaw Nation Health Services (CNHS) outpatient clinics. These tests indicated a generally high level of relevance among the survey items and domains, and few problems in terms of respondent comprehension. They also revealed a need for some revision to clarify service structures in specific clinics and to allow CNHS to gather clinic-specific information. </li>
    <li><strong>Field testing</strong>. In the summer of 2005, RAND fielded a revised draft instrument, with 81 items and 16 domains. RAND, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and CNHS worked together to develop specifications for drawing the sample, which included 1200 randomly selected adults who had visited any of five CNHS outpatient clinics. The administration mode was two-wave mail only, which achieved an overall response rate of 58%. </li>
</ul>
<p>An analysis of the field test results indicated that the draft instrument by and large demonstrated a high level of reliability and measured its intended domains well. Based on their findings, the CAHPS team made only a few modifications to the questionnaire, namely minimizing the perceived discrimination composite from 6 to 2 items, and removing one item from the health education composite. </p></div>
