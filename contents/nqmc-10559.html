Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of Medicare members 65 years of age and older who reported having urine leakage in the past 6 months and who reported that urine leakage made them change their daily activities or interfered with their sleep a lot.</p>
<p>This is one component of a three-part survey measure that provides information on how well physicians manage urinary incontinence (UI) in Medicare members 65 and older. See the following related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summaries of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measures:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><a href="/content.aspx?id=49758" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Management of urinary incontinence in older adults: the percentage of Medicare members 65 years of age and older who reported having urine leakage in the past six months and who discussed their urinary leakage problem with a health care provider</a>. </li>

</ul>
<p>This measure is collected using the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS). Results are calculated by NCQA using data collected in the combined baseline and follow-up survey samples from the same measurement year.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Urinary incontinence (UI), or the unintentional loss of urine, is a condition that affects between 10 percent and 30 percent of adults. An estimated 13 million Americans suffer from bladder control problems; 85 percent of these are women. The prevalence of UI increases with age, and although it should not be considered a normal part of aging, up to 35 percent of people 60 years of age and older are incontinent. The underlying causes of UI can be diagnosed and managed effectively by a practitioner (Tannenbaum et al., 2001; Lee, Phanumus, &amp; Fields, 2000). UI can cause a wide range of morbidity in the elderly, including pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections (UTIs), social withdrawal and depression ("Overview," 1996). UI is one of the major causes of institutionalization of the elderly (National Kidney and Urologic Disease Advisory Board, 1994; "Assessment," 2000).</p></div>
