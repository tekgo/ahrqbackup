Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 6 to 12 years of age as of the index prescription start date (IPSD) with an ambulatory prescription dispensed for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication who remained on the medication for at least 210 days and who, in addition to the visit in the initiation phase, had at least two follow-up visits with a practitioner within 270 days (9 months) after the initiation phase ended.</p>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the more common chronic conditions of childhood. Children with ADHD may experience significant functional problems, such as school difficulties; academic underachievement; troublesome relationships with family members and peers; and behavioral problems (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 2000). Given the high prevalence of ADHD among school-aged children (4 to 12 percent), primary care clinicians will regularly encounter children with ADHD and should have a strategy for diagnosing and long-term management of this condition (AAP, 2001).</p>
<p>Practitioners can convey the efficacy of pharmacotherapy to their patients. AAP guidelines (2000) recommend that once a child is stable, an office visit every 3 to 6 months allows assessment of learning and behavior. Follow-up appointments should be made at least monthly until the child's symptoms have been stabilized.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders affecting children. Ten percent of American children have been diagnosed with ADHD, whose main features are hyperactivity, impulsiveness and an inability to sustain attention or concentration (Bloom, Jones, &amp; Freeman, 2013; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2012). </li>
    <li>Children with ADHD add a high annual cost to the United States (U.S.) education system&ndash;on average, $5,000 each year for each student with ADHD (Robb et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>Studies suggest that there is increased risk for drug use disorders in adolescents with untreated ADHD (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2011). </li>
    <li>When managed appropriately, medication for ADHD can control symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsiveness and inability to sustain concentration. To ensure that medication is prescribed and managed correctly, it is important that children be monitored by a pediatrician with prescribing authority. </li>
</ul>
