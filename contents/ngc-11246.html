Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of December 2016. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/InptCDiff/CDiff.pdf" title="University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version. </p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the original guideline document for additional information. </p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-E) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Points for Adult Patients</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Definitive diagnosis of <em>Clostridium (C.) difficile</em> infection (CDI) requires either the presence of toxigenic <em>C. difficile</em> in stool with compatible symptoms, or clinical evidence of pseudomembranous colitis (see Table 2, Figure 4 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>Once identified, CDI should be classified according to severity (see Table 3 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>Although risk factors for CDI (see Table 1 in the original guideline document) should guide suspicion for CDI, testing should be ordered only when indicated (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) <em>[IC]</em>. </li>
    <li>Choice of test should be guided by a multistep algorithm for the rapid diagnosis of CDI (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document) <em>[IIC].</em> </li>
    <li>Single-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (not part of the UMHS algorithm) occurs as part of the new Biofire test panel for gastrointestinal pathogens and should not be used if CDI is suspected <em>[IIIB]</em>. However, if <em>C. difficile</em> is detected as part of this panel and the patient's symptoms are compatible with CDI, then treatment is appropriate and additional testing is unnecessary <em>[IIC]</em>. </li>
    <li>Patients who are asymptomatic, actively being treated or completed treatment for CDI with clinical improvement in symptoms, or have post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome after CDI should not undergo testing for CDI <em>[IIIC]</em>. </li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Points for Pediatric Patients &le;18 Years of Age</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The decision to test children for CDI is complicated given a high rate of asymptomatic carriage, especially in infants &lt;12 months of age. Although risk factors for CDI should guide suspicion for CDI, testing should be ordered only when indicated (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) <em>[IC]</em>. Indications and contraindications for testing pediatric patients are included in Figure 1, but testing is rarely indicated or recommended for infants &lt;12 months <em>[IIC]</em> and consultation with pediatric infectious diseases (ID) is recommended. Children from 12 months to 36 months of age may be diagnosed with CDI if no alternative etiology for diarrhea is identified and with positive diagnostic testing <em>[IIC]</em>. </li>
    <li>Definitive diagnosis of CDI requires either the presence of toxigenic <em>C. difficile </em>in stool with other symptoms, or clinical evidence of pseudomembranous colitis (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). Choice of test should be guided by a multistep algorithm for the rapid diagnosis of CDI (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). Single-step testing (not part of the UMHS algorithm) occurs as part of the new Biofire test panel for gastrointestinal pathogens and should not be used if CDI is suspected <em>[IIIE]</em>. However, if <em>C. difficile </em>is detected as part of this panel and the patient's symptoms are compatible with CDI, then treatment is appropriate and additional testing is unnecessary <em>[IIC]</em>. Patients who are asymptomatic, actively being treated or completed treatment for CDI with clinical improvement in symptoms, or have post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome after CDI should not undergo testing for CDI <em>[IIIC]</em>. </li>
    <li>Once identified, CDI should be classified according to severity (see Table 3 in the original guideline document). Certain pediatric conditions are associated with severe CDI and should be treated as such (see Table 3 in the original guideline document) <em>[IIC]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong> (see Figure 3 in the original guideline document for general strategy and Table 3 for pediatric-specific dosing recommendations) </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Mild-Moderate CDI: Patient does not meet criteria for "severe" or "complicated" CDI
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg/dose PO QID for 10 days, maximum 500 mg/dose <em>[IIC]</em>.<br />
        OR </li>
        <li>In patients with metronidazole allergy, pregnant, nursing, or on warfarin therapy, or who fail to improve after 3 to 5 days of oral metronidazole therapy: vancomycin 10 mg/kg/dose PO QID, up to maximum 125 mg/dose x 10 days <em>[IIC]</em>. </li>

    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Complicated CDI: Patients with septic shock, ICU admission within 2 days of CDI diagnosis, surgery related to CDI diagnosis, ileus, toxic megacolon, peritonitis, or bowel perforation
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Triple therapy = vancomycin up to 500 mg PO QID, metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours up to 500 mg/dose, and vancomycin enema 10-20 ml/kg/dose up to 1000 mL/dose every 6 hours of vancomycin 500 mg/L solution (if tolerated, 20 mL/kg/dose every 6 hours is preferred, however in patient with additional administration considerations, a minimum of 10 mL/kg/dose every 8 hours should be used) (in patients with ileus, bowel obstruction or toxic megacolon; bowel perforation is a contraindication to enema therapy) <em>[IC]</em>.</li>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Strategy for Literature Search</strong></span></p>
<p>Within the Medline (Ovid) database, the following search strategy was used for most of the search topics, except for the searches on suppurative thrombosis, endocarditis, and vascular infection. The search below is identified as Main in the Methodological Appendix (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Because the appropriate indexing terms either do not exist or were applied inconsistently, the main search uses keywords in addition to MeSH terms to arrive at the following main strategy. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>exp *Clostridium difficile/ or exp *enterocolitis/ or exp *Clostridium Infections/ </li>
    <li>exp *Hirschsprung Disease/ </li>
    <li>limit 2 to "all child (0 to 18 years)" </li>
    <li>1 or 3 </li>
    <li>exp animals/ not (exp animals/ and humans/) </li>
    <li>4 not 5 </li>
    <li>limit 6 to (english language and yr="2013 -Current") </li>
    <li>remove duplicates from 7. The searches on suppurative thrombosis, endocarditis, and vascular infection used the first 3 searches of the main search strategy. The MEDLINE In-Process search was based entirely on keywords. </li>
</ol>
<p>Results were limited to: English, and 2013 to present. The Main search retrieved 893 references. When the search hedges for Guidelines, Clinical Trials, and Cohort Studies were added, the base results are as follow:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>C-Diff Guidelines, total results were 8 </li>
    <li>C-Diff Clinical Trials, total results were 27 </li>
    <li>C-Diff Cohort Studies, total results were 59 </li>
</ul>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure. The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p>
<p>Search details and evidence tables are available in the methods companion (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A recent retrospective study showed that, for patients where the <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection (CDI) episode was a first or greater recurrence, prophylactic vancomycin reduced the risk of recurrent CDI by nearly 50% when on other antibiotics. </li>
    <li>A prospective case series of patients with multiple recurrences of CDI found that daily administration of kefir (a probiotic yogurt drink) in combination with a staggered and tapered oral vancomycin or metronidazole regimen achieved a treatment success rate of 84%. </li>
    <li>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial, addition of two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against CDI toxins A and B to standard therapy did not impact the initial infection course but did significantly reduce infection recurrence. </li>
    <li>Based on a wealth of data from case reports, systematic reviews, and clinical trials, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) appears quite effective for recurrent CDI with cure rates exceeding 85% to 90% in most studies. </li>
    <li>In patients who have severe, complicated (fulminant) CDI and clinical deterioration despite maximal medical therapy, surgery may confer mortality benefit. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There are circumstances when false-negative results can occur with enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing alone. Immunocompromised patients with symptoms suggestive of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection (CDI) (colitis on imaging, ileus with minimal stool production, and/or white blood cell count [WBC] &gt;15,000 cells/&mu;L with diarrhea) and patients receiving empiric therapy at the time of diagnosis are at risk for a false-negative EIA test. </li>
    <li>A recent retrospective study showed that, for patients where the CDI episode was a first or greater recurrence, prophylactic vancomycin reduced the risk of recurrent CDI by nearly 50% when on other antibiotics. Potential downsides of this strategy include selection for resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em>, onset or worsening of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and additional expense. </li>
    <li>Caution should be exercised with use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Those who undergo FMT for CDI may be at increased risk of IBD flare, fever, and/or elevation in inflammatory markers. </li>
    <li>In advanced fulminant CDI, surgical mortality can be up to 80% (range 19% to 80%). </li>
    <li>Delayed surgical intervention may result in increased morbidity and mortality. Prior studies indicate higher mortality rates if surgical intervention occurred after evidence of end-organ failure (e.g., intubation for respiratory failure, vasopressor therapy for hemodynamic instability, or acute renal failure). </li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Contraindications for <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection (CDI) testing
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Asymptomatic </li>
        <li>Recently finished therapy (test of cure) </li>
        <li>While on therapy </li>
        <li>Mild post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (relative contraindication - use clinical judgment) </li>
        <li>Recently finished therapy and symptoms have resolved (test of cure) </li>
        <li>Infants under 12 months of age generally should not be tested (for exceptions, see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). </li>
        <li>Caution is advised in ordering and interpreting testing in children 12 to 36 months of age and should be limited to children with risk factors for acquiring CDI (see Table 1 in the original guideline document) and no alternative etiology for diarrhea or ileus identified. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Colonoscopy is contraindicated, especially for diagnostic purposes, in patients with hemodynamic instability or with significant risk for bowel perforation (e.g., fulminant colitis, recent bowel surgeries, bowel obstruction). </li>
    <li>Bowel perforation is a contraindication to enema therapy. </li>
    <li>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is contraindicated in patients with complicated CDI. </li>
    <li>Partial colectomy is contraindicated. </li>
    <li>For pediatric patients with prolonged or recurrent CDI, metronidazole should not be used for chronic therapy due to possible neurotoxicity. </li>
</ul>
