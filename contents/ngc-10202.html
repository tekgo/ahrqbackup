<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>A-E, L</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis of Cervical Insufficiency</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should be evaluated for risk factors for cervical insufficiency. A thorough medical history at initial evaluation may alert clinicians to risk factors in a first or index pregnancy. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Detailed evaluation of risk factors should be undertaken in women following a mid-trimester pregnancy loss or early premature delivery, or in cases where such complications have occurred in a preceding pregnancy. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management of Cervical Insufficiency</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prophylactic Transvaginal Cerclage</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>In women with a history of cervical insufficiency, urinalysis for culture and sensitivity and vaginal cultures for bacterial vaginosis should be taken at the first obstetric visit and any infections so found should be treated. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women with a history of three or more second trimester pregnancy losses or extreme premature deliveries, in whom no specific cause other than potential cervical insufficiency is identified, should be offered elective cerclage at 12 to 14 weeks of gestation. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prophylactic Transabdominal Cerclage</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>In women with a classic history of cervical insufficiency in whom prior vaginal cerclage has been unsuccessful, abdominal cerclage can be considered in the absence of additional mitigating factors. (<strong>II-3C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women who have undergone trachelectomy should have abdominal cerclage placement. (<strong>II-3C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Emergency Cerclage</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="7">
    <li>Emergency cerclage may be considered in women in whom the cervix has dilated to &lt;4 cm without contractions before 24 weeks of gestation. (<strong>II-3C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conservative Observational Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: See the original guideline document for the five steps of conservative management.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="8">
    <li>Women in whom cerclage is not considered or justified, but whose history suggests a risk for cervical insufficiency (1 or 2 prior mid-trimester losses or extreme premature deliveries), should be offered serial cervical length assessment by ultrasound. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cerclage Based on Ultrasound Measurement of Cervical Length</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="9">
    <li>Cerclage should be considered in singleton pregnancies in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth or possible cervical insufficiency if the cervical length is &le;25 mm before 24 weeks of gestation. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is no benefit to cerclage in a woman with an incidental finding of a short cervix by ultrasound examination but no prior risk factors for preterm birth. (<strong>II-1D</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Multiple Gestations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="11">
    <li>Present data do not support the use of elective cerclage in multiple gestations even when there is a history of preterm birth; therefore, this should be avoided. (<strong>I-D</strong>) </li>
    <li>The literature does not support the insertion of cerclage in multiple gestations on the basis of cervical length. (<strong>II-1D</strong>) </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed or MEDLINE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library in 2012 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., uterine cervical incompetence) and key words (e.g., cervical insufficiency, cerclage, Shirodkar, cerclage, MacDonald, cerclage, abdominal, cervical length, mid-trimester pregnancy loss). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to January 2011.</p>
<p>Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Complications</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Three randomized clinical trials have shown that cerclage is associated with increased medical interventions and doubles the risk of puerperal pyrexia. The use of tocolytics increases with cerclage, as does the rate of hospital admissions, and one study found a higher rate of Caesarean sections. However, the risk and nature of complications is influenced by whether the cerclage is inserted electively or as an emergency with membranes bulging through the cervix. The complications reported with cerclage include sepsis, premature rupture of membranes, premature labour, cervical dystocia, cervical laceration at delivery (11% to 14%), and hemorrhage. </li>
    <li>However, meta-analysis of a number of studies has not confirmed higher rates of chorioamnionitis or preterm pre-labour membrane rupture in women managed with cerclage than in those managed by other means. Although cervical dystocia is frequently cited as a complication of cerclage due to cervical scarring, data do not support its being truly attributable to cerclage; the increased risk of cervical laceration, however, although it appears to be unrelated to the timing of the removal of the cerclage, can be attributed to the cerclage. </li>
