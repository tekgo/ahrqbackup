<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Mental health providers that value and respect an individual's autonomy, independence and safety seek to avoid the use of dangerous or restrictive interventions at all times (Donat, 2003). The use of seclusion and restraint is limited to situations deemed to meet the threshold of imminent danger and when restraint and seclusion are used, such use is rigorously monitored and analyzed to prevent future use. Providers also seek to prevent violence or aggression from occurring in their treatment environments by focusing their attention on prevention activities that have a growing evidence base (Donat, 2003).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Restraint and seclusion are coercive high-risk interventions used in many psychiatric care settings in order to control aggressive and violent behaviors. The use of restraint and seclusion may result in adverse events including death and permanent loss of function for some patients, as well as staff injuries. According to the Joint Commission's sentinel event voluntary reporting database from 2004 through 2011, there have been 110 sentinel events related to physical restraint of a patient resulting in death or permanent loss of function. </li>
    <li>The rationale for restraint and seclusion use is not well understood and varies according to the organization's culture and perception on the most appropriate way to handle escalating behaviors. Restraint and seclusion use adversely impacts healthcare organizations, staff, and patients. </li>
    <li>According to Bergk et al. (2008), rates of seclusion and restraint use vary from 0% to 66%. Reports estimate 50 to 150 deaths per year in the U.S. due to improper monitoring and application. Even in cases where restraints have been applied correctly, fatal patient outcomes have occurred. Additionally, acute excited states resulting from restraint or seclusion have been associated with patient deaths. The use of restraint and seclusion creates significant risks for psychiatric patients. Among the most serious risks are: injury or death, retraumatization of patients with a trauma history, loss of dignity and psychological harm. </li>
    <li>In mental health, violence is considered endemic. The use of restraint and seclusion contributes to a cycle of workplace violence which may claim as much as 23% to 50% of staff time, account for 50% of staff injuries, increase the risk of injury to patients and staff by 60%, and increase the length of stay, potentially setting recovery back at least 6 months with each occurrence. Results from the National Crime Victimization Survey for 1993 to 1999 which was conducted by the Department of Justice showed the annual rate of nonfatal, job-related violent crime against psychiatrists and mental health professionals was 68.2 per 1,000 and 69.0 per 1,000 for mental health custodial workers as compared to 12.6 per 1,000 for work in all occupations. </li>
    <li>According to Cromwell et al. (2005), the daily cost of care increases with restraint and seclusion use and contributes to significant workforce turnover reportedly ranging from 18% to 62%, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to several million dollars. The most significant day-to-day cost is the amount of staff time spent managing restraint and seclusion events. The full cost to an organization is unknown due to the lack of research. A time/motion/task analysis of restraint estimated the cost of one episode from $302 to $354, according to the number of restraint methods used (e.g., physical, mechanical, or medication). A 1-hour restraint involved 25 different activities and claimed nearly 12 hours of staff time to manage and process the event from beginning to end. Collectively, restraint use claimed more than 23% of staff time and $1.4 million in staff-related costs, which represented nearly 40% of the operating budget for the inpatient service studied. </li>
    <li>Many hospitals and residential programs, serving different ages and populations, have successfully reduced their use and redirected existing resources to support additional staff training, implement prevention-oriented alternatives, and enhance the environment of care. Significant savings result from reduced staff turnover, hiring and replacement costs, sick time, and liability related costs. </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Alpha testing was conducted during May and June 2006 at approximately 40 volunteer test sites to assess feasibility and data collection effort. A set of measures was recommended by the Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) to comprise the final test set addressing the domains of Assessment, Patient Safety and Continuity/Transitions of Care.</p>
<p>The Specification Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures Hospital-Based Inpatient Psychiatric Services Test Set was finalized in September 2006. In late 2006 a total of 196 hospitals volunteered to participate in the Hospital-Based Inpatient Psychiatric Services (HBIPS) pilot test. Data collection for the test set began with January 1, 2007 discharges and continued throughout December 31, 2007.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of the pilot test, a subset of 39 hospitals was randomly selected to collect and transmit monthly hospital clinical data (HCD) to help assess data quality and data reliability. The data quality study continued with data collection and transmission for the 12 months of 2007. Feedback on data quality was provided to each performance measurement systems vendor submitting HCD.</p>
<p>The final phase of testing consisted of site visits to a sample of participating pilot hospitals to assess the reliability of data abstracted and reported by those hospitals. Reliability test site visits were conducted at 18 randomly selected pilot hospitals. Selection of the test sites was based on multiple characteristics, including hospital demographics, populations served, bed size and type of facility.</p>
<p>All of the HBIPS measures have undergone a rigorous process of public comment, alpha testing and broad-scale pilot testing and are recognized by the field as important indicators of hospital-based inpatient psychiatric care. </p></div>
