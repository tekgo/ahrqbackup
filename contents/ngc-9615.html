<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of recommendation (1-3) and classification of evidence (I-III) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The workgroup attempted to address previously determined recommendations and whether there was additional scientific evidence to support each one, move it to a different level, or eliminate it altogether. The workgroup then reviewed the literature to assess whether new recommendations could be made. Changes from the original guideline are noted accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>
<p>An admission electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed on all patients in whom blunt cardiac injury (BCI) is suspected (no change).</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>If the admission ECG reveals a new abnormality (arrhythmia, ST changes, ischemia, heart block, and unexplained ST changes), the patient should be admitted for continuous ECG monitoring. For patients with preexisting abnormalities, comparison should be made to a previous ECG to determine need for monitoring (updated). </li>
    <li>In patients with a normal ECG result <em>and</em> normal troponin I level, BCI is ruled out. The optimal timing of these measurements, however, has yet to be determined. Conversely, patients with normal ECG results but elevated troponin I level should be admitted to a monitored setting (new). </li>
    <li>For patients with hemodynamic instability or persistent new arrhythmia, an echocardiogram should be obtained. If an optimal transthoracic echocardiogram cannot be performed, the patient should have a transesophageal echocardiogram (updated). </li>
    <li>The presence of a sternal fracture alone does not predict the presence of BCI and thus should not prompt monitoring in the setting of normal ECG result and troponin I level (moved from Level 3). </li>
    <li>Creatinine phosphokinase with isoenzyme analysis should not be performed because it is not useful in predicting which patients have or will have complications related to BCI (modified and moved from Level 3). </li>
    <li>Nuclear medicine studies add little when compared with echocardiography and should not be routinely performed (no change). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Elderly patients with known cardiac disease, unstable patients, and those with an abnormal admission ECG result can safely undergo surgery provided that they are appropriately monitored. Consideration should be given to placement of a pulmonary artery catheter in such cases (no change). </li>
    <li>Troponin I should be measured routinely for patients with suspected BCI; if elevated, patients should be admitted to a monitored setting and troponin I should be followed up serially, although the optimal timing is unknown (new). </li>
    <li>Cardiac computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to help differentiate acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from BCI in trauma patients with abnormal ECG result, cardiac enzymes, and/or abnormal echo to determine need for cardiac catheterization and/or anticoagulation (new). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classes of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective randomized controlled trials - the criterion standard of clinical trials. Some may be poorly designed, have inadequate numbers, or suffer from other methodological inadequacies.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Clinical studies in which the data were collected prospectively and retrospective analyses that were based on clearly reliable data. Types of studies so classified include observational studies, cohort studies, prevalence studies, and case-control studies.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Studies based on retrospectively collected data. Evidence used in this class indicates clinical series, database or registry review, large series of case reviews, and expert opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong>: The recommendation is convincingly justifiable based on the available scientific information alone. This recommendation is usually based on Class I data; however, strong Class II evidence may form the basis for a Level 1 recommendation, especially if the issue does not lend itself to testing in a randomized format. Conversely, low-quality or contradictory Class I data may not be able to support a Level 1 recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong>: The recommendation is reasonably justifiable by available scientific evidence and strongly supported by expert opinion. This recommendation is usually supported by Class II data or a preponderance of Class III evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong>: The recommendation is supported by available data, but adequate scientific evidence is lacking. This recommendation is generally supported by Class III data. This type of recommendation is useful for educational purposes and in guiding future clinical research.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2012 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A computerized search of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database was undertaken using the PubMed Entrez interface. English-language citations were queried during the period of March 1997 through December 2011 using the primary search strategy: [((<em>myocardial injury OR myocardial contusion</em>) AND (<em>traumatic OR trauma</em>)) OR (<em>heart injuries</em>)] AND <em>humans</em> NOT (<em>case reports OR letter OR comment OR news</em>).</p>
<p>Review articles, autopsy studies, and investigations of indirect myocardial injury after trauma were excluded. The PubMed Related Articles algorithm was also used to identify additional articles similar to the items retrieved by the primary strategy. Of approximately 599 articles identified by these two techniques, those dealing with either prospective or retrospective studies examining blunt cardiac injury (BCI) were selected, composing of 27 institutional studies evaluating diagnosis and management of adult patients with suspected or proven blunt cardiac trauma. Each article was reviewed by two members of the BCI workgroup.</p>
<p>A separate search strategy was used to identify relevant radiology articles using the search ([blunt] AND [cardiac] AND [injury]). Because major changes in imaging technology have been widely adopted in the last 5 years, 2005 was chosen as a starting point. This yielded 13 articles, 3 of which examined radiologic diagnostic studies. The bibliographies of these articles were then hand searched to yield recent literature regarding utility of diagnostic imaging.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline developer searched NLM Medline (PubMed) using the following search terms: heart injuries, myocardial injuries, cardiac, wounds, nonpenetrating, and contusion. The literature search was performed for January 2012 &ndash; September 2017 and included all articles with screening modalities for blunt cardiac injury, and excluded non-English language, case reports, letters, comments, news, and reviews. </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2012 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Practice Management Guideline (PMG) committee reviewed research published since the original guideline to formulate new recommendations based on this recent literature. Data for screening of blunt cardiac injury (BCI) were collated, and a consensus was obtained for the recommendations.</p>
<p>The workgroup attempted to address previously determined recommendations and whether there was additional scientific evidence to support each one, move it to a different level, or eliminate it altogether. The workgroup then reviewed the literature to assess whether new recommendations could be made.</p>
<p>This PMG has 10 total recommendations, including two Level 2 updates, two upgrades from Level 3 to Level 2, and three new recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive literature review performed. Sixty-nine (69) articles and abstracts were reviewed for appropriateness of inclusion by a single reviewer (KC). The final article list (N=3) was reviewed and no articles were found to contradict the recommendations of this guideline. Recent studies have confirmed the findings of this guideline for screening of blunt cardiac injury.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
