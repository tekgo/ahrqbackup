Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the classification of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>1-3</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>What sequences should be obtained on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate vestibular schwannomas before and after surgery?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>Adults with vestibular schwannomas.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><em>Initial Preoperative Evaluation</em></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Imaging used to detect vestibular schwannomas should use high-resolution T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI.</p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Standard T1, T2, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion weighted imaging MR sequences obtained in axial, coronal, and sagittal plane may be used for detection of vestibular schwannomas.</p>
<p><em>Preoperative Surveillance</em></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Preoperative surveillance for growth of a vestibular schwannoma should be followed with either contrast-enhanced 3-dimensional (3-D) T1 magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) or high-resolution T2 (including constructive interference in steady state [CISS] or fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition [FIESTA] sequences) MRI.</p>
<p><em>Postoperative Evaluation</em></p>
<p><em>Level 2</em>: Postoperative evaluation should be performed with postcontrast 3-D T1 MPRAGE, with nodular enhancement considered suspicious for recurrence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there a role for advanced imaging for facial nerve detection preoperatively (e.g., CISS/FIESTA or diffusion tensor imaging)?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>Adults with proven or suspected vestibular schwannomas by imaging.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: T2-weighted MRI may be used to augment visualization of the facial nerve course as part of preoperative evaluation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the expected growth rate of vestibular schwannomas on MRI, and how often should they be imaged if a "watch and wait" philosophy is pursued?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>Adults with suspected vestibular schwannomas by imaging.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: MRIs should be obtained annually for 5 yr, with interval lengthening thereafter with tumor stability.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>Do cystic vestibular schwannomas behave differently than their solid counterparts?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>Adults with vestibular schwannomas with cystic components.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Adults with cystic vestibular schwannomas should be counseled that their tumors may more often be associated with rapid growth, lower rates of complete resection, and facial nerve outcomes that may be inferior in the immediate postoperative period but similar to noncystic schwannomas over time.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p>Should the extent of lateral internal auditory canal involvement be considered by treating physicians?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>Adult patients with vestibular schwannomas.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: The degree of lateral internal auditory canal involvement by tumor adversely affects facial nerve and hearing outcomes and should be emphasized when interpreting imaging for preoperative planning.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p>How should patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and vestibular schwannoma be imaged and over what follow-up period?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>Adult patients with NF2 and vestibular schwannomas</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: In general, vestibular schwannomas associated with NF2 should be imaged (similar to sporadic schwannomas) with the following caveats:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>More frequent imaging may be adopted in NF2 patients because of a more variable growth rate for vestibular schwannomas, and annual imaging may ensue once the growth rate is established. </li>
    <li>In NF2 patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, growth rate of a vestibular schwannoma may increase after resection of the contralateral tumor, and therefore, more frequent imaging may be indicated, based on the nonoperated tumor's historical rate of growth. </li>
    <li>Careful consideration should be given to whether contrast is necessary in follow-up studies or if high-resolution T2 (including CISS or FIESTA-type sequences) MRI may adequately characterize changes in lesion size instead. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 7</span></strong></p>
<p>How long should vestibular schwannomas be imaged after surgery, including after gross-total, near-total, and subtotal resection?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>Adult patients with vestibular schwannomas followed after surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: For patients receiving gross total resection, a postoperative MRI may be considered to document the surgical impression and may occur as late as 1 yr after surgery. For patients not receiving gross total resection, more frequent surveillance scans are suggested; annual MRI scans may be reasonable for 5 yr. Imaging follow-up should be adjusted accordingly for continued surveillance if any change in nodular enhancement is demonstrated.</p>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Process Overview</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the management of vestibular schwannomas (VSs). Additional details of the systematic review are provided below and within the introduction and methodology chapter of the guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>A total of 2070 citations were manually reviewed. Two independent reviewers evaluated and abstracted full-text data for each article. Citations focused on the imaging of VSs in adult patients largely in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) era (January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2014), published in English, were considered.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having VSs </li>
    <li>Patients &ge;18 years of age </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Published between January 1, 1946 and December 31, 2014 </li>
    <li>Quantitatively presented results </li>
    <li>Was not an in vitro study (for novel molecular markers, in vitro studies were included on patient samples) </li>
    <li>Was not a biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Was published in English </li>
    <li>Was not a meeting abstract, editorial, letter, or commentary </li>
    <li>Studies may include mixed pathology, however the data pertaining to acoustic neuromas (ANs)/VSs was abstractable from the paper </li>
    <li>&gt;5 patients or patient samples </li>
</ul>
<p>Systematic reviews, guidelines, or meta-analyses conducted by other authors were not included in this guideline creation. These documents were developed using different inclusion criteria than those specified in this guideline. Therefore, they may have included studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria stated above.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014. The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed and Cochrane Central. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the medical librarian using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies (see Figure 1 and Table 1 in the full guideline [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The guideline committee also examined lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Collection Process and Assessment of Bias</span></strong></p>
<p>Abstracts that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved in full text form and evaluated for confirmation that they met criteria as suggested by prior abstract review. The information was then used for construction of the evidence tables.</p>
<p>The possibility of systematic bias in results was addressed by first stratifying the evidence based on the class of evidence quality, which highlights the limitations in this literature. Given the dearth of evidence for many of these questions, formal methods for studying publication bias, such as funnel plots were not feasible.</p>
<p>In addition, one obvious bias inherent to these studies is selection bias. For a patient to be in an imaging study, that patient, by definition, underwent imaging for a clinical reason, which may bias results toward larger and possibly more aggressive tumors than would be seen in a cohort of all vestibular schwannomas (VSs). However, it is important to note that this bias is uniform across all studies of this type. Therefore, while individual practitioners may have skewed results by differences in case selection, there is no clear mechanism by which these biases are systematically distributed.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification System and Recommendation Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The concept of linking evidence to recommendations has been further formalized by the American Medical Association (AMA) and many specialty societies, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). This formalization involves the designation of specific relationships between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations to avoid ambiguity. Refer to the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables, and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The Vestibular Schwannoma Guidelines Task Force members were required to report all possible conflicts of interest (COIs) prior to beginning work on the guideline, using the COI disclosure form of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Guidelines Committee, including potential COIs that are unrelated to the topic of the guideline. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair reviewed the disclosures and either approved or disapproved the nomination. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair are given latitude to approve nominations of Task Force members with possible conflicts and address this by restricting the writing and reviewing privileges of that person to topics unrelated to the possible COIs. The conflict of interest findings are provided in detail in the full-text introduction and methods manuscript (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>
