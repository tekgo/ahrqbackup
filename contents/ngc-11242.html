<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, D, </strong>or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the levels of certainty regarding net benefit (<strong>High, Moderate</strong>, and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends that primary care professionals individualize the decision to offer or refer adults without obesity who do not have hypertension, dyslipidemia, abnormal blood glucose levels, or diabetes to behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity. Existing evidence indicates a positive but small benefit of behavioral counseling for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this population. Persons who are interested and ready to make behavioral changes may be most likely to benefit from behavioral counseling. (<strong>C recommendation</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adults 18 years or older who are of normal weight or overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). It does not apply to persons who have known CVD risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, abnormal blood glucose levels, or diabetes) or persons with obesity or who are underweight. </p>
<p><strong>Behavioral Counseling Interventions</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF reviewed 88 trials with more than 120 distinct interventions focused on promoting a healthful diet, physical activity, or both. Dietary messages documented in the interventions typically focused on general heart-healthy eating patterns (increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, fiber, and whole grains; decreased consumption of salt, fat, and red and processed meats). This guidance is generally consistent with major dietary recommendations, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 2015&ndash;2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Similarly, national guidelines suggest that US adults should perform at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity, and also should perform strengthening activities at least twice per week. Physical activity messages used in the reviewed interventions emphasized gradually increasing aerobic activities to recommended levels, with many studies emphasizing walking.</p>
<p>Interventions categorized as low intensity included print- or Web-based materials with tailored feedback and tools for behavior change, ranging from 1-time mailings to monthly mailings over 3 years. Medium- and high-intensity interventions commonly included face-to-face individual or group counseling or both, with telephone, email, and text message follow-up. These more intensive interventions ranged in duration from 4 weeks to 6 years, with the active intervention period often lasting for 6 months. Interventions were delivered by primary care clinicians, health educators, behavioral health specialists, nutritionists or dieticians, exercise specialists, and lay coaches. Behavioral change techniques included goal setting and planning, monitoring and feedback, motivational interviewing, addressing barriers to change, increasing social support, and general education and advice. Adherence to all interventions was relatively high; adherence to high-intensity interventions was generally lower than for less-intensive interventions. Overall, there appeared to be a dose-response effect, with higher-intensity interventions demonstrating greater and statistically significant benefits. However, this dose-response effect was not seen for interventions targeting physical activity only, among which some low-intensity interventions demonstrated benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recognizes the important contributions of public health approaches to improving diet, increasing physical activity levels, and preventing CVD. The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends several community-based interventions to promote physical activity, including community-wide campaigns, social support interventions, school-based physical education, and environmental and policy approaches. It also recommends programs promoting healthful diet and physical activity for persons at increased risk for type 2 diabetes on the basis of strong evidence of the effectiveness of these programs in reducing the incidence of new-onset diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF has evaluated the evidence on several aspects of CVD prevention in adults with and without common risk factors, including behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults with cardiovascular risk factors, screening for and management of obesity in adults, and screening for abnormal blood glucose levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p>In other recommendation statements, the USPSTF had recommended screening for high blood pressure, use of statin medications in persons at risk for CVD, screening and counseling for tobacco smoking cessation, and aspirin use in certain persons for CVD primary prevention.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has published national dietary and physical activity guidelines for Americans.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: A systematic evidence review was prepared by the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence-based Practice Center for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Sources and Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>This review was designed as an extension of 2 prior systematic reviews conducted by the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence-based Practice Center for the USPSTF that focused on healthful diet and physical activity counseling for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention among individuals with and without known CVD risk factors (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose). As such, relevant studies from those reviews were reevaluated for potential inclusion. Then, the following databases were searched for new relevant English-language literature published between January 1, 2013, and May 25, 2016: MEDLINE, PubMed (publisher-supplied records only), PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (see eMethods in the systematic review supplement). Collectively, the literature searches encompassed literature published from 1966 through May 25, 2016. The database searches were supplemented by reviewing bibliographies from other relevant literature and from expert suggestions. ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. Since May 2016, ongoing surveillance was conducted using searches of a subset of core clinical journals identified by the USPSTF to identify major studies published in the interim that may affect the conclusions or understanding of the evidence and therefore the related USPSTF recommendation. The last surveillance was conducted on March 24, 2017, and identified no new studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently reviewed all identified titles and abstracts and relevant full-text articles against prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria (see eTable 1 in the systematic review supplement). Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Eligible studies were fair- and good-quality randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of primary care&ndash;relevant interventions focused on improving dietary habits, increasing physical activity, and/or reducing sedentary time with the primary aim of CVD primary prevention among adults 18 years or older. Studies were excluded from this review if they (1) targeted persons with known CVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance, or a combination of these factors; (2) targeted persons categorized as high risk based on a cardiovascular risk&ndash;assessment tool; or (3) generically stated that participants must have 1 or more CVD risk factors to be included. In contrast, studies in adults who may be at elevated risk for CVD based on factors such as age, race/ethnicity, family history of CVD, overweight or obesity, high-normal blood pressure, or history of gestational diabetes, as well as those conducted among unselected samples or samples selected because of suboptimal behavior (e.g., did not meet national physical activity guidelines) were included. Eligible interventions were those conducted in primary care or referred from primary care, or those deemed feasible for primary care or referral given the nature of the intervention delivery (e.g., face-to-face counseling, telephone support), behavior change techniques (e.g., goal setting, self-monitoring), or setting (e.g., home, community). Studies had to report a behavioral outcome (i.e., diet-, physical activity&ndash;, sedentary time&ndash;related measure), intermediate outcome (e.g., blood pressure, lipid levels, weight, incidence of hypertension), or health outcome (i.e., morbidity, mortality, health-related quality of life) or report adverse events related to the intervention.</p></div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of all eligible studies, using criteria outlined by the USPSTF (see eTable2 in the systematic review supplement). Each study was assigned a final quality rating of good, fair, or poor; disagreements between the investigators were resolved through consensus after discussion and consultation with additional investigators. Studies were rated as poor quality and excluded if they had several important major risks of bias, including very high attrition at 6 to 12 months (e.g., greater than 40%), differential attrition between intervention groups (e.g., greater than 20%), lack of baseline comparability between groups without adjustment for those variables, or other issues in the conduct, analysis, or reporting of results of the trial that were judged to considerably bias the results (e.g., possible selective reporting, inappropriate exclusion of participants from analyses, and questionable validity of randomization and allocation concealment procedures). One reviewer completed primary data abstraction, and a second reviewer checked all data for accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Summary tables were created for study characteristics, population characteristics, intervention characteristics, and outcomes. The data on health outcomes (KQ1) and adverse events (KQ4) did not allow for pooled analyses and so were summarized descriptively. For intermediate health outcomes (KQ2) and behavioral outcomes (KQ3), random-effects meta-analyses using the method of DerSimonian and Laird were run to calculate the pooled differences in mean changes (for continuous data) and pooled odds ratio (for binary data). The between-group difference for each outcome as reported by each respective study was pooled favoring adjusted over unadjusted reported effect estimates. If a between-group effect estimate and variance were not provided, a crude effect estimate was calculated. Within each study, 1-year outcome data were chosen for meta-analyses if available; otherwise, the point closest to 1 year was chosen. If a trial had more than 1 active intervention group, data for the most intensive group or the group that was the most similar with other interventions included in the analysis were plotted. Methods consistent with the previous review were used to estimate and categorize the intensity (total contact in minutes) of each intervention group as low (&le;30 minutes), medium (31-360 minutes), or high (&gt;360 minutes). Results at all other points and for all intervention groups within each trial were reported in tabular format.</p>
<p>Statistical heterogeneity among the pooled studies was examined using standard &chi;<sup>2</sup> tests, and the proportion of total variability in point estimates was approximated using the <em>I</em><sup>2</sup> statistic.</p>
<p>Visual displays were first used to investigate whether the heterogeneity among the results was associated with any pre-specified population or intervention characteristics; meta-regression was then used when indicated. To evaluate small-study effects, funnel plots and the Egger test (for continuous outcomes) or Peters test (for dichotomous outcomes) were used. Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corp) was used for all quantitative analyses. All significance testing was 2-sided, and results were considered statistically significant at <em>P</em> &lt;.05. </p>
<p>The strength of the overall body of evidence for each KQ was graded as high, moderate, low, or insufficient based on established methods and addressed the consistency, precision, reporting bias, study quality, and dose response related to each outcome.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) systematically reviews the evidence concerning both the benefits and harms of widespread implementation of a preventive service. It then assesses the certainty of the evidence and the magnitude of the benefits and harms. On the basis of this assessment, the USPSTF assigns a letter grade to each preventive service signifying its recommendation about provision of the service (see table below). An important, but often challenging, step is determining the balance between benefits and harms to estimate "net benefit" (that is, benefits minus harms).</p>

<p class="Note">*<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group "invited for screening" and the group "not invited for screening."</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the Task Force constructs a "chain of evidence" within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term <em>certainty</em> will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as "high" certainty (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as "moderate" certainty. Certainty is "low" when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peer Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) send the draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. The draft evidence review is also posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response to Public Comment</strong></span></p>
<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from November 29, 2016, to January 2, 2017. A small number of comments were received, and all were reviewed by the USPSTF. A few respondents encouraged the USPSTF to issue separate recommendations for behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and interventions to promote physical activity. Other respondents felt that the evidence base was different for the 2 types of behavioral counseling interventions and suggested that the USPSTF assign separate and different grades. The USPSTF carefully reviewed the evidence on interventions that promoted a healthful diet only, those that promoted physical activity only, and those that promoted both. The USPSTF recognizes that the evidence base for these interventions varies, and although the evidence for behavior change was greater for interventions focusing on physical activity, there were no meaningful differences in intermediate or overall health outcomes. After reviewing the evidence, the USPSTF reaffirmed its conclusion that there is a positive but small benefit of behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet, physical activity, or both in persons who do not have cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Patients and health care professionals can decide together, based on patient interest and the availability of local resources, whether a focus on a healthful diet, physical activity, or both is most appropriate. Several comments agreed with the USPSTF's inclusion of language reinforcing the established benefits of healthful lifestyle behaviors and encouraged better definition of the nature of behavioral counseling interventions. The USPSTF retained its emphasis that all patients can gain health benefits from a healthful diet and appropriate physical activity and added language defining both. The USPSTF also clarified that the recommended behavioral counseling interventions are more intensive than just general promotion of a healthful diet and physical activity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Comparison with Guidelines from Other Groups</strong></span></p>
<p>Recommendations for behavioral counseling for healthful diet and physical activity for cardiovascular disease prevention in adults without known risk factors were considered from the following groups: the Community Preventive Services Task Force, the American Heart Association, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.</p></div>

Behavioral counseling interventions have been found to improve healthful behaviors, including beneficial effects on fruit and vegetable consumption, total daily caloric intake, salt intake, and physical activity levels. Behavioral counseling interventions led to improvements in systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference that persisted over 6 to 12 months.

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/" title="USPSTF Web site">Web site</a>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size <em>Guide to Clinical Preventive Services.</em></p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div>
