<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chronic Pain</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 18</strong></p>
<p>In people with SCD and chronic pain, what are the safest and most effective chronic pain management strategies and treatment algorithms (e.g., patient assessment and follow-up, use of chronic opioids, adjuvant pharmacological therapies, and behavioral therapies)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Determine the cause and type of SCD-related chronic pain. This includes chronic pain with objective signs such as avascular necrosis (AVN) and leg ulcers, and chronic pain without objective signs due to neuroplasticity of the peripheral or central nervous system. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use a combination of the patient's response to treatment&mdash;including pain relief, side effects, and functional outcomes&mdash;to guide the long-term use of opioids. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Encourage people to use deep tissue/deep pressure massage therapy, muscle relaxation therapy, and self-hypnosis as indicated. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use long- and short-acting opioids to manage chronic pain that is not relieved by nonopioids. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Assess all people with SCD for chronic pain annually or more often as needed. This assessment should include descriptors of the pain; its severity on a numerical scale; its location; factors that precipitate or relieve it, including biopsychosocial factors; and its effect on the patient's mood, activity, employment, quality of life, and vital signs. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use a partnership agreement leading to a written, individualized treatment plan (to include risks, benefits, and side effects) with the patient if long-term opioids are indicated. The partnership agreement should list the patient's rights and responsibilities, and the treatment plan should list the type, amount, and route of administration of the opioid in question, including random drug urine testing. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Appoint one physician or other clinician to write the biweekly to monthly prescriptions for long-term opioids. Refills without seeing the patient should be kept to a minimum, and people on chronic opioid therapy must be evaluated in person every 2&ndash;3 months. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Document all encounters with a patient, including medical history, physical exam, diagnosis, plan of management, type and amount of opioids prescribed and their side effects, if any, and lab data as needed. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Encourage people receiving opioids to increase their fluid intake, maintain dietary fiber intake per the current dietary fiber recommendations, and to use stool softeners and bowel stimulant laxatives such as senna and/or docusate as needed. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Believe the patient's report of pain and optimize therapeutic outcomes to achieve adequate pain relief and improve the patient's quality of life. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Refer patients for evaluation by a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, social worker, or addiction specialist as needed. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
    <li>Assess all people for other types of non-SCD related chronic pain including postoperative pain, pain due to trauma, pain due to therapy, iatrogenic pain, and pain due to comorbid conditions. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 19</strong></p>
<p>In people with SCD and AVN, what are the most effective management strategies to reduce pain and functional disability (e.g., analgesics, physical therapy, surgery, or transfusion therapy)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Evaluate all children and adults with SCD and intermittent or chronic hip pain for AVN by history, physical exam, radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as needed. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Treat AVN with analgesics and consult physical therapy and orthopedics for assessment and follow-up. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, High-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Refer symptomatic patients with advanced stages of AVN to an orthopedic surgeon and SCD specialist for evaluation and possible hip arthroplasty. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leg Ulcers</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 20</strong></p>
<p>In people with SCD and leg ulcers, what are the most effective therapies to accelerate ulcer healing (e.g., topical therapy, surgery, or antibiotics)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Inspect the lower extremities during physical examination for active or healed ulcers, record their number, and measure their depth. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Treat leg ulcers in patients with SCD with initial standard therapy (i.e., debridement, wet to dry dressings, and topical agents). (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Evaluate people with chronic recalcitrant deep leg ulcers for osteomyelitis. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Evaluate possible etiologies of leg ulcers to include venous insufficiency and perform wound culture if infection is suspected or if the ulcers deteriorate. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Treat with systemic or local antibiotics if leg ulcer site is suspicious for infection and wound culture is positive and organism susceptible. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consult or refer to a wound care specialist or multidisciplinary wound team for persistent or recalcitrant leg ulcers. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pulmonary Hypertension (PH)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 21</strong></p>
<p>In people with SCD and PH, what are the most effective therapies to reduce mortality (e.g., transfusion, hydroxyurea, and other pharmacological agents)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>If people with SCD have symptoms or signs suggestive of PH, refer them for echocardiography. (<strong>Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>For people with an elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) &ge;2.5 m/sec by echocardiography, consult a provider with expertise in pulmonary hypertension to guide further assessment and management, including right heart catheterization, and consideration of PH therapy. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Renal Complications</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 22</strong></p>
<p>In people with SCD and chronic kidney disease (CKD), what are the interventions (including pharmacotherapy, dialysis, and renal transplant) that slow the deterioration of renal function, prevent the development of end-stage renal disease, and reduce mortality?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>If microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria is identified, order a 24-hour urine test for protein. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>Refer people with proteinuria (&gt;300 mg/24 hours) to a nephrologist for further evaluation. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>For adults with microalbuminuria without other apparent cause, initiate angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>For adults with proteinuria without other apparent cause, initiate ACE inhibitor therapy. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with microalbuminuria or proteinuria, consult a nephrologist. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider patients with SCD with modest elevations of serum creatinine (&gt;0.7 mg/dL in children, &gt;1.0 mg/dL in adults) to have renal impairment and refer to a nephrologist for further evaluation. (<strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong>) </li>
    <li>Give ACE inhibitor therapy for renal complications when indicated even in the presence of normal blood pressure. (<strong>Moderate Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Renal replacement therapy (e.g., hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and renal transplantation) should be used in people with SCD if needed. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stuttering/Recurrent Priapism</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Question 23</strong></p>
<p>In people with SCD and stuttering priapism, what is the relative efficacy of the available treatments (chronic hormonal therapy, chronic transfusion therapy, alpha-adrenergic agents, phosphodiesterase type 5 [PDE-5] esterase inhibitors, and hydroxyurea) on recurrence of priapism and sexual functional outcomes?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">

<p class="Note">*Exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies includes: (1) evidence from studies that yield estimates of the treatment effect that are large and consistent; (2) evidence in which all potential biases may be working to underestimate an apparent treatment effect, and therefore, the actual treatment effect is likely to be larger than that suggested by the study data; and (3) evidence in which a dose-response gradient exists.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consensus Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel believed that, for this guideline document to be most helpful to primary care providers and specialty health care professionals, it needed to be comprehensive. This required that, in areas with minimal existing direct evidence, the panel would provide recommendations based on their and others' expert opinions. Those recommendations are labeled as "consensus." Several different situations, outlined below, led to the use of consensus statements.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Systematic reviews conducted by the methodology team revealed minimal or no supporting evidence (e.g., management of acute hepatic sequestration). </li>
    <li>An adequate systematic review of the literature was not feasible because of anticipated low yield or no yield (e.g., comparative effectiveness of management approaches for individuals with SCD presenting with fever or worsening anemia). </li>
    <li>Recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge, practice experience, and ability to extrapolate evidence from non-SCD populations (e.g., management of chronic opioid therapy in chronic SCD pain). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>These recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge to adapt recommendations derived from existing guidelines and synthesized evidence developed by other professional societies (e.g., management of acute and chronic pain in SCD). The panel clearly identified these statements as consensus recommendations and acknowledges that these areas represent gaps in the evidence base and areas for future research. </li>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>General Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>Due to the comprehensive scope of the guidelines, the search strategies for the systematic reviews were designed to have high sensitivity and low specificity; hence, the strategies were often derived from population and condition terms (e.g., people with sickle cell disease [SCD] who have priapism) and not restricted or combined with outcome or intervention terms. To be inclusive of the available literature in the field, searches included randomized trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Case reports and small case series were included only when outcomes involved harm (e.g., the adverse effects of hydroxyurea) or when rare complications were expected to be reported.</p>
<p>Literature searches involved multiple databases (e.g., Medline&reg; In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE&reg;, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL&reg;], TOXLINE&reg;, and Scopus) and used controlled vocabulary (prespecified) terms supplemented with keywords to define concept areas.</p>
<p>An updated search was performed to span the time from June 1, 2010 through July 11, 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline-specific Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive study of several databases was conducted, and all human studies in English published from 1970 to July 2010 that addressed each Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study Design (PICOS) question were identified. When the literature search found insufficient evidence on a topic (e.g., chronic pain management), these topics were supplemented with recommendations derived from other published guidelines by professional organizations which were based on systematic reviews of broader population groups; these recommendations are labeled "Consensus&ndash;Adapted."</p>
<p>Detailed information on the search questions, search strategy, study selection process, and list of excluded studies used in this guideline can be found in the systematic review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Evidence Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>Methodologists developed evidence tables to summarize individual study findings and present the quality of evidence (i.e., confidence in the estimates of effect). The tables included descriptions of study population, sickle cell disease (SCD) genotypes, interventions, and outcomes. Additional methodological details are discussed in each evidence table, including the search question, search strategy, study selection process, and list of excluded studies (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Framework</strong></p>
<p>The methodology team used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to grade the quality of evidence, and, in concert with the panel, determine the strength of recommendations. The GRADE framework is accepted by more than 75 national and international organizations (see exhibit 3 in the original guideline document). It provides the advantages of: (a) separately judging the quality of supporting evidence and strength of recommendations, and (b) incorporating factors other than evidence in decisionmaking (e.g., the balance of benefits and harms; the perceived values and preferences of those with SCD; resources; and clinical and social context). GRADE emphasizes the use of patient-important outcomes (i.e., outcomes that affect the way patients feel, function, or survive) over laboratory and physiologic outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Determining Evidence Quality</strong></p>
<p>In the GRADE framework, the quality of evidence (in this case, the body of evidence) is rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. The quality of evidence derived from randomized trials starts as "high," and the quality of evidence derived from observational studies starts as "low." The quality of evidence can then be lowered due to methodological limitations in individual studies (risk of bias), inconsistency across studies (heterogeneity), indirectness (the extent to which the evidence fails to apply to the specific clinical question in terms of the patients, interventions, or outcomes), imprecision (typically due to a small number of events or wide confidence intervals), and the presence of publication and reporting biases. Conversely, the quality of evidence can be upgraded in certain situations such as when the treatment effect is large or a dose-response relationship is evident.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Systematic Reviews and Clinical Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The expert panel and methodology team identified existing systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines that were relevant to the topics of this guideline, even though they were not necessarily specific to people with SCD. If the methodological quality of these resources was found to be appropriate by the methodology team, they were used. Using this external evidence was considered helpful because well-conducted systematic reviews made the process of identifying relevant studies more feasible. In addition, using existing guidelines developed by professional organizations enabled the panel to develop more comprehensive recommendations that addressed specific aspects of care in individuals with SCD. Usually, this external evidence was derived from studies in non-sickle cell patient cohorts because it was felt that they offered more precise and useful inferences than evidence derived from sickle cell patient studies. For example, comparative evidence in the area of pain management in people with SCD was sparse. In this situation, pain management guidelines from individuals with other pain-related conditions proved to be helpful.</p>
<p>The methodology team used the AMSTAR tool to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Recent well-conducted systematic reviews were identified that addressed hydroxyurea therapy in pediatric and adult patients. The expert panel and methodology team appraised these reviews and conducted additional searches to update the existing systematic review through May 2010 to find evidence for the benefits, harms, and barriers of using hydroxyurea. Regarding the management of children with SCD complications, the panel also used recent evidence that had been systematically reviewed.</p>
<p>Existing clinical practice guidelines were considered acceptable if they had prespecified clinical questions, were developed after a comprehensive literature search, had explicit and clear criteria for the inclusion of evidence, and included recommendations that were explicitly linked to the quality of supporting evidence. The expert panel and methodology team used relevant recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) adaptation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) "Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use," and the American Pain Society's "Guideline for the Management of Acute and Chronic Pain in Sickle-Cell Disease," and "Clinical Guidelines for the Use of Chronic Opioid Therapy in Chronic Noncancer Pain."</p>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>These guidelines were developed by an expert panel composed of health care professionals with expertise in family medicine, general internal medicine, adult and pediatric hematology, psychiatry, transfusion medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency department nursing, and evidence-based medicine. Panel members were selected by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Process and Methodology</strong></p>
<p>The expert panel first convened in the spring of 2009 to establish the vision and purpose of the panel, discuss the process and schedule for producing the guidelines, and determine the critical areas to be addressed. Prior to this meeting, the expert panel participated in a conference call to introduce the panel&rsquo;s work and discuss the overarching questions that should be answered by the guidelines. Before beginning the writing of the guidelines report, the expert panel divided its work into sections dealing with preventive care or health maintenance, recognition and management of acute sickle-cell disease (SCD)-related complications, recognition and management of chronic SCD-related complications, and the two most broadly assessed and available disease-modifying therapies for SCD, hydroxyurea and chronic blood transfusions.</p>
<p>With the assistance of the methodology team and the supporting evidence center, the panel then developed key questions and literature search terms to identify evidence. The field of SCD has a limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or large prospective cohort studies to guide clinical decisionmaking; therefore, few of the recommendations in this document are based on this highest quality evidence. For common health issues, the panel included the evidence-based recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) as well as vetted recommendations of other groups. These recommendations include the SCD reproductive-related recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the immunization recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the acute and chronic pain management recommendations of the American Pain Society (APS). These recommendations are denoted as "Consensus&ndash;Adapted."</p>
<p>Recognizing the need to provide practical guidance for common problems that may lie outside of the panel's evidence reviews or available science, in many areas the published evidence was supplemented by the expertise of the panel members, who have many years of experience in managing and studying individuals with SCD. Recommendations based on the opinions of the expert panel members are labeled as "Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise." Each is clearly labeled with the strength of the recommendation and the quality of evidence available to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Determining the Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework rates the strength of recommendations as "strong" or "weak." However, the panel modified the GRADE system and used a third category&mdash;moderate&mdash;when they determined that patients would be better off if they followed a recommendation, despite there being some level of uncertainty about the magnitude of benefit of the intervention or the relative net benefit of alternative courses of action. The panel intends for these moderate-strength recommendations to be used to populate protocols of care and provide a guideline based on the best available evidence. The panel does not intend for weak- or moderate-strength recommendations to generate quality-of-care indicators or accountability measures or affect insurance reimbursement. Variation in care in the areas of weak- or moderate-strength recommendations may be acceptable, particularly in ways that reflect patient values and preferences. Conversely, strong recommendations represent areas in which there is confidence in the evidence supporting net benefit, and the recommendations likely apply to most individuals with sickle cell anemia.

<p class="Note">*Exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies includes: (1) evidence from studies that yield estimates of the treatment effect that are large and consistent; (2) evidence in which all potential biases may be working to underestimate an apparent treatment effect, and therefore, the actual treatment effect is likely to be larger than that suggested by the study data; and (3) evidence in which a dose-response gradient exists.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consensus Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel believed that, for this guideline document to be most helpful to primary care providers and specialty health care professionals, it needed to be comprehensive. This required that, in areas with minimal existing direct evidence, the panel would provide recommendations based on their and others' expert opinions. Those recommendations are labeled as "consensus." Several different situations, outlined below, led to the use of consensus statements.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus&ndash;Panel Expertise</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Systematic reviews conducted by the methodology team revealed minimal or no supporting evidence (e.g., management of acute hepatic sequestration). </li>
    <li>An adequate systematic review of the literature was not feasible because of anticipated low yield or no yield (e.g., comparative effectiveness of management approaches for individuals with sickle cell disease [SCD] presenting with fever or worsening anemia). </li>
    <li>Recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge, practice experience, and ability to extrapolate evidence from non-SCD populations (e.g., management of chronic opioid therapy in chronic SCD pain). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consensus&ndash;Adapted</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>These recommendations were based on the panel's expert knowledge to adapt recommendations derived from existing guidelines and synthesized evidence developed by other professional societies (e.g., management of acute and chronic pain in SCD). The panel clearly identified these statements as consensus recommendations and acknowledges that these areas represent gaps in the evidence base and areas for future research. </li>
