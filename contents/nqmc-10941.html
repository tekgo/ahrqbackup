Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the risk-adjusted 30-day unplanned readmission rate for cancer patients. </p>
<p>This is a cancer-specific measure. It provides the rate at which all patients, regardless of payer type, have an unplanned re-hospitalization within 30 days of an index admission. The readmission is defined as a subsequent inpatient admission to the reporting facility, which occurs within 30 days of the discharge date of an eligible index admission.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Unnecessary hospital readmissions negatively impact cancer patients, by compromising their quality of life, by placing them at risk for health-acquired infections, and by increasing the costs of their care. Furthermore, unplanned readmissions during treatment can delay treatment completion and, potentially, worsen patient prognosis. Preventing these readmissions improves the quality of care for cancer patients. While several studies have examined readmissions, readmissions in cancer patients have not been studied extensively. Existing studies have largely focused on post-operative readmissions in cancer patients, particularly in patients with colon or pancreatic cancer, and calculated readmission rates following major cancer surgery at between 16% and 25%. Moreover, patient factors, including age, comorbidities, and hospital length of stay have been identified as risk factors in these patients (Rochefort &amp; Tomlinson, 2012). Moya et al. (2006) observed a 20% readmission rate in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients along with an extended length of stay during the readmission (25 &plusmn; 21 days). Infections (some associated with the graft), graft failure, coagulation disorders, and a second neoplasm were the most frequent causes of readmission. Bejanyan et al. (2012) examined readmissions in patients with myeloablative allogeneic HCT and observed a 39% readmission rate in these patients. Infections, fever, gastrointestinal complications, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were the most frequent reasons for readmission. Less is known about other readmissions in cancer patients as well as the predictive factors in these readmissions.</p>
<p>This measure was developed in support of the following goals:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Initiate data-driven initiatives to improve the safety and patient-centeredness of cancer care </li>
    <li>Optimize cancer care to balance obligatory hospital stays with potential nights at home during recovery </li>
    <li>Foster improved patient care, better population health, and reductions in hospital costs, where possible, in line with the National Quality Strategy </li>
    <li>Enhance the portfolio of meaningful outcome measures that may be adopted for the Prospective Payment System (PPS)-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting (PCHQR) </li>
</ul>
<p>Following alpha and beta testing of this measure, the Alliance of Dedicated Cancer Centers (ADCC) and Comprehensive Cancer Center Consortium for Quality Improvement (C4QI) member institutions plan to use this measure in support of these goals. Routine measurement of unplanned readmissions will allow for improvements in care coordination and will support quality improvement efforts to drive reductions in unplanned readmissions. The routine use of a more valid measure that is specific to cancer will help the centers to direct their efforts to address potentially preventable readmissions, thereby improving the quality of care at their centers.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, with nearly 600,000 cancer-related deaths expected in 2015. It is estimated that more than 1.7 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in 2015, and nearly 14.5 million Americans with a history of cancer were alive in 2014. Cancer disproportionately affects older Americans, with 78% of all cancers diagnosed in people 55 years of age and older (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2015). Oncology care contributes greatly to Medicare spending and accounted for an estimated $125 billion in healthcare spending in 2010. This figure is projected to rise to between $173 billion and $207 billion by 2020 (Mariotto et al., 2011). Given the current and projected increases in cancer prevalence and costs of care, it is essential that healthcare providers look for opportunities to lower the costs of cancer care.</p>
<p>Reducing readmissions after hospital discharge has been proposed as an effective means of lowering healthcare costs and improving the outcomes of care. Research suggests that between 9% and 48% of all hospital readmissions are preventable, owing to inadequate treatment during the patient's original (index) admission or after discharge (Benbassat &amp; Taragin, 2000). Jencks et al. (2009) estimated that unplanned readmissions cost the Medicare program $17.4 billion in 2004. Accordingly, all-cause and disease-specific unplanned readmissions rates have been adopted by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) as key indicators of inpatient quality care. Additionally, Medicare began reducing payments to hospitals with excess readmissions in October 2012, as mandated in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.</p>
<p>Benbassat et al. (2000) concluded that global readmission rates are not useful indicators of healthcare quality and, instead, recommended measuring readmissions at the condition level. Readmission rates have been developed for pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure. However, cancer has lagged behind these conditions in the development of validated readmission rates.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Validity</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there are only a few peer-reviewed publications that are specific to readmissions in cancer patients. Thus, the measure's face validity was confirmed through written and oral communications between the measure developers and clinicians across Comprehensive Cancer Center Consortium for Quality Improvement (C4QI) during alpha testing.</p>
<p>Criterion-related validity demonstrates if the new measure specifications actually measure true 30-day unplanned readmissions for cancer patients. This was demonstrated after alpha testing, using calendar year (CY) 2012 data for participating facilities to demonstrate the appropriateness of the denominator population and numerator inclusion and exclusion criteria. Please see the original measure documentation for more details.</p>
<p>Admission status variables for the <em>30-Day Unplanned Readmissions for Cancer Patients</em> measure are defined using the Type of Admission/Visit on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) UB-04 Uniform Bill (CMS, 2006). The following definitions were applied:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Emergency (code 1)</em>: The patient required immediate medical intervention as a result of severe, life threatening or potentially disabling conditions. Generally, the patient was admitted through the emergency room. </li>
    <li><em>Urgent (code 2)</em>: The patient required immediate attention for the care and treatment of a physical or mental disorder. Generally, the patient was admitted to the first available, suitable accommodation. </li>
    <li><em>Elective (code 3)</em>: The patient's condition permitted adequate time to schedule the availability of a suitable accommodation. </li>
</ul>
<p>For the purpose of the measure, these categories were grouped into "planned" and "unplanned" admission visits:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Planned readmissions</em> are those within 30 days of discharge from an acute care hospital that are a scheduled part of the patient's plan of care. Planned readmissions are not counted as outcomes in this measure. </li>
    <li><em>Unplanned readmissions</em> are defined as an acute clinical event experienced by a patient that requires urgent re-hospitalization. Unplanned readmissions are counted as outcomes in this measure. For the purpose of the <em>30-Day Unplanned Readmissions for Cancer Patients</em> measure, unplanned readmissions include those with an "emergency" or "urgent" type of admission/visit. </li>
</ul>
<p>90.9% of unplanned readmissions that were reviewed during beta testing were included in the new <em>30-Day Unplanned Readmission for Cancer Patients</em> measure. Moreover, 86.2% of planned readmissions were not included, indicating that the new measure is accurately capturing 30-day unplanned readmissions in cancer patients (see Table 4.4 in the original measure documentation for more details).</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong></p>
<p>Statistical analyses confirmed that the measure is well-defined and precisely specified so that it can be implemented consistently within and across organizations and allow for accurate comparisons to be made. Refer to Sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 in the original measure documentation for more details.</p>
<p>The results for all ten participating centers as well as individual facilities indicates that, while the measure is reliable, some variability from the average across all participating sites is present when examining scores at the individual facility level. This could be due to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Inconsistent application of the definitions of "planned" or "unplanned" among facilities </li>
    <li>Inconsistent assignment of admission types (<em>emergency</em>, <em>urgent</em>, and/or <em>elective</em>)</li>
    <li>Anomalies in other numerator inclusion/exclusion criteria</li>
    <li>Application of numerator exclusion criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that this measure has been submitted for consideration for the Prospective Payment System (PPS)-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting (PCHQR) Program, which would exclude mandatory reporting by non-PCHs. The measure testing results (presented in the original measure documentation) suggest that it is an appropriate measure for PCHs and non-PCH member institutions of C4QI. Through additional use and further testing, the measure denominator may be expanded to a broader patient population.</p></div>

Unplanned readmissions* for patients within 30 days of the index admission</p>
<p>Unplanned readmissions are defined as readmissions at the reporting facility classified as "emergency" or "urgent" type on the UB-04 Uniform Bill. Any unplanned readmissions that do not fall within the numerator exclusions below are counted in the measure numerator.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: All patients from the denominator population who experience an unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of an index admission with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)/International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) principal diagnosis codes different from the two bundles of codes listed above are included in the numerator calculation for the measure.</p>
<p class="Note">*<strong>Unplanned readmissions</strong>: An unplanned readmission is defined as a hospital readmission that occurs within 30 days of discharge from a prospective payment system (PPS)-exempt cancer hospital (PCH) and is not scheduled as part of the patient's plan of care. Typically, it is associated with an acute medical event experienced by a patient that requires urgent re-hospitalization. For the purpose of this measure, this includes any readmission (within 30 days of the index admission) with a type of admission/visit of "emergency" or "urgent" on the UB-04 Uniform Bill. For example, some cancer patients develop post-operative infections after discharge that require management in the inpatient setting. Unplanned readmissions may be potentially avoidable and are, therefore, included in the measure numerator.</p>
<p class="Note">Unplanned readmissions are identified using the type of admission/visit (form locator 14) submitted on the UB-04 Uniform Bill, where the type of admission/visit is "emergency" or "urgent" (coded value = 1 or 2):</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk Adjustment Model</strong></p>
<p>The most common type of risk adjustment used in healthcare outcomes measures is based on the observed rate of the outcome compared to the expected rate. The expected rate is based on patient and, sometimes, hospital demographics. If the observed rate is much higher than the expected rate, then the performance of the hospital would be considered poor. Conversely, if the observed rate is much lower than the expected rate, then the performance of the hospital would be better than expected. A risk-adjusted rate may also be formulated for comparing hospital performance as presented in Figure 2 in the original measure documentation.</p>
<p>Alternative methodologies include indirect or direct standardization and hierarchical modeling. Applying indirect or direct standardization to models that include multiple risk factors is cumbersome. Standardization techniques are typically applied in creating age-adjusted rates in epidemiological studies. Hierarchical modeling is applied when there are multiple levels of risk adjustors. For instance, hierarchical modeling may be used to adjust for variables at the hospital level (e.g., teaching hospital, specialization, etc.) and patient level (e.g., race, payer, diagnosis, etc.). Although some hospital-level variables may be of interest in risk-adjusting readmission rates, the proposed cancer measure will only be applied to eleven hospitals at this point. Therefore, it would not be possible to estimate hospital level adjusters with an acceptable level of precision.</p>
<p>Statistical modeling is typically used to estimate the expected rate for a hospital. In this case, logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of an unplanned readmission that meets the proposed definition outlined in this report based on the risk factors included in the model. The probability of readmission was then summed over the index admissions for each hospital to calculate the expected readmission rate. Prior to fitting the logistic regression model, the dataset was randomly divided into a fit (i.e., model set) and validation set. This strategy allowed the fitting of the model to be tested for robustness or generalization by comparing the c-statistic resulting from using the fit model on the validation dataset. A similar value for the c-statistic (or Area Under the Curve) was indicative of a stable model that may be used for risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The logistic model was fit using SAS/STAT software, Version 9.4 using the 'stepwise' option and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Prior to inclusion in the model, the potential association between the various risk adjustors was assessed by calculating the tetrachoric correlation. Variables were reviewed to identify any variables with correlations of more than 0.5 or less than -0.5, which would require exclusion from the model to avoid multicollinearity (highly-correlated risk factors). No variables were excluded due to multicollinearity. The logistic model diagnostics, such as the c-statistic, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test, the likelihood ratio test and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), were all collected and analyzed prior to selecting the risk adjustment model.</p>
<p>Continuous variables, such as the number of comorbidities, length of stay and patient age, were all analyzed to determine cut points where the rate of readmission increased or decreased. The model was constructed using only binary indicator variables to allow for an intuitive interpretation and application in practice. The table below lists the risk adjustors that were included in the modeling. Note that three of the variables were removed due to non-statistical issues. The relationship between the presence and absence of metastatic disease was inconsistent among the providers. Two of the reporting hospitals reported lower readmission rates for patients with metastatic disease and four reported higher rates. Due to this inconsistency, this variable was not included in the model at this time. Further investigation is required to determine if this is a reporting issue or if this this is due to the mix of cancer services offered at the various hospitals. The treatment of the patient in the emergency room and bone marrow transplant (BMT) status were both removed from the model because only two providers reported these services. As more providers are added to the dataset, these two variables may be good candidates to include in future models.</p>
