<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of recommendation (I-III) and classification of evidence (I-III) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Which Patients With Hemodynamically Unstable Pelvic Fractures Warrant Early External Mechanical Stabilization?</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The use of a pelvic orthotic device (POD) does not seem to limit blood loss in patients with pelvic hemorrhage. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>The use of a POD effectively reduces fracture displacement and decreases pelvic volume. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Which Patients Require Emergent Angiography?</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with pelvic fractures and hemodynamic instability or signs of ongoing bleeding after nonpelvic sources of blood loss have been ruled out should be considered for pelvic angiography/embolization. <strong>Level I Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Patients with evidence of arterial intravenous contrast extravasation (ICE) in the pelvis by computed tomography (CT) may require pelvic angiography and embolization regardless of hemodynamic status. <strong>Level I Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Patients with pelvic fractures who have undergone pelvic angiography with or without embolization, who have signs of ongoing bleeding after nonpelvic sources of blood loss have been ruled out, should be considered for repeat pelvic angiography and possible embolization. <strong>Level II Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Patients older than 60 years with major pelvic fracture (open book, butterfly segment, or vertical shear) should be considered for pelvic angiography without regard for hemodynamic status. <strong>Level II Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Although fracture pattern or type does not predict arterial injury or need for angiography, anterior fractures are more highly associated with anterior vascular injuries, whereas posterior fractures are more highly associated with posterior vascular injuries. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Pelvic angiography with bilateral embolization seems to be safe with few major complications. Gluteal muscle ischemia/necrosis has been reported in patients with hemodynamic instability and prolonged immobilization or primary trauma to the gluteal region as the possible cause, rather than a direct complication of angioembolization. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Sexual function in males does not seem to be impaired after bilateral internal iliac arterial embolization. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What Is the Best Test to Exclude Intra-Abdominal Bleeding?</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) is not sensitive enough to exclude intraperitoneal bleeding in the presence of pelvic fracture. <strong>Level I Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>FAST has adequate specificity in patients with unstable vital signs and pelvis fracture to recommend laparotomy to control hemorrhage. <strong>Level I Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Diagnostic peritoneal tap (DP)/Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is the best test to exclude intra-abdominal bleeding in the hemodynamically unstable patient. <strong>Level II Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>In the hemodynamically stable patient with a pelvic fracture, CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast is recommended to evaluate for intra-abdominal bleeding regardless of FAST results. <strong>Level II Recommendation</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Are There Radiologic Findings Which Predict Hemorrhage?</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Fracture pattern on pelvic X-ray does not single-handedly predict mortality, hemorrhage, or the need for angiography. <strong>Level II Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Presence/location of hematoma does not predict or exclude the need for angiography and possible embolization. <strong>Level II Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>CT of the pelvis is an excellent screening tool to exclude pelvic hemorrhage. <strong>Level II Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Absence of contrast extravasation on CT does not always exclude active hemorrhage. <strong>Level II Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Pelvic hematoma &gt;500 cm<sup>3</sup> in size has an increased incidence of arterial injury and need for angiography. <strong>Level II Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Isolated acetabular fractures are as likely to require angiography as pelvic rim fractures. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>If a retrograde urethrocystogram is required, it should be performed after CT with intravenous contrast. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What Is the Role of Noninvasive Temporary External Fixation Devices?</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Temporary pelvic binders (TPBs) effectively reduce unstable pelvic fractures as well as definitive stabilization and decrease pelvic volume. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>TPBs may limit pelvic hemorrhage but do not seem to affect mortality. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>TPBs work as well or better than emergent external pelvic fixation (EPF) in controlling hemorrhage. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Which Patients Warrant Retroperitoneal (Preperitoneal) Packing?</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Retroperitoneal pelvic packing is effective in controlling hemorrhage when used as a salvage technique after angiographic embolization. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Retroperitoneal pelvic packing is effective in controlling hemorrhage when used as part of a multidisciplinary clinical pathway including a POD/C-clamp. <strong>Level III Recommendation</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classes of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective randomized clinical trials.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Clinical studies in which data were collected prospectively or retrospective analyses based on clearly reliable data.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Studies based on retrospectively collected data.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation is convincingly justifiable based on the available scientific information alone. It is generally based on Class I data or strong Class II evidence may form the basis for a Level I recommendation. Conversely, weak or contradictory Class I data may not be able to support a Level I recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Level II</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation is reasonably justifiable by available scientific evidence and strongly supported by expert opinion. It is usually supported by Class II data or a preponderance of Class III evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation is supported by available data, but adequate scientific evidence is lacking. It is generally supported by Class III data. This type of recommendation is useful for educational purposes and in guiding future studies.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2011 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A computerized search of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database was undertaken using the OVID interface. English language citations were included for the period of 1999 through 2010 using the primary search strategy: pelvis, fracture, hemorrhage, trauma, and retroperitoneal hematoma. The dates were selected to allow comprehensive review of articles published since the prior systematic review with minimal overlap.</p>
<p>Review articles and case reports were excluded. Moreover, studies not directly addressing hemorrhage with pelvic fracture were excluded. The PubMed Related Citations algorithm was also used to identify additional articles similar to the items retrieved by the primary strategy. Of the 1,432 articles identified by these two techniques, those dealing with prospective or retrospective studies were selected, comprising 50 studies specifically evaluating hemorrhage associated with pelvic fracture in adult or pediatric patients.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search of published medical literature was conducted from Jan. 2010 to Sept. 2016 using PubMed, OVID Medline, Cochrane Library and CINAHL databases using the following key words: "pelvis", "fracture hemorrhage", "trauma", and "retroperitoneal hematoma".</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Inclusion criteria: All articles with trauma-related pelvic hemorrhage and mortality as well as techniques to control hemorrhage from pelvic fracture. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2011 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The workgroup for the Practice Management Guidelines for Hemorrhage in Pelvic Trauma consisted of nine Trauma Surgeons, an Orthopedic Surgeon specializing in trauma, and an Interventional Radiologist (see Table 1 in original guideline document).</p>
<p>Recommendations were classified as level 1, 2, or 3 according to the definitions listed in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>Six questions regarding hemorrhage from pelvic fracture were addressed in formulating the recommendations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Which patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures warrant early external mechanical stabilization? </li>
    <li>Which patients require emergent angiography? </li>
    <li>What is the best test to exclude extrapelvic bleeding? </li>
    <li>Are there radiologic findings which predict hemorrhage? </li>
    <li>What is the role of noninvasive temporary external fixation devices? </li>
    <li>Which patients warrant preperitoneal packing? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>Articles were screened by a professional librarian by title and abstract, then salient articles were reviewed by a single reviewer (DC). Final article list (n=73) was fully reviewed and no articles were found to contradict the recommendations of the practice management guideline. Recent articles focused on the same topics address in the 2011 guidelines, with the same conclusions with the exception of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) used for hemorrhage in pelvic fracture. These articles were small case studies with not enough data at this point to require an update of the management guideline.</p></div>

Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider.
