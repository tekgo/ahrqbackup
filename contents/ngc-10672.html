<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Bone is a common sites of metastasis, affecting patients with a wide variety of malignancies including breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, bladder, endometrial, thyroid, kidney, myeloma, and melanoma. The presence of tumor in bone can cause significant morbidity including pain, neurologic dysfunction, hypercalcemia, and pathologic fracture leading to significant functional loss. The optimal treatment of a patient with bone metastases depends on many factors, including evaluation of the patient's goals of care, performance status, mechanical stability of the affected bone, life expectancy, and overall extent of disease. Both osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions may be associated with pain and risk of fracture. Management decisions frequently involve collaboration among several types of specialists, including diagnostic radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, surgeons, pain medicine specialists, physiatrists, and palliative care professionals. Similar to the approaches used for patients treated with curative intent, optimal management of patients with bone metastases requires multidisciplinary consideration of localized therapies such as surgery and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with systemic therapies including pain medications, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy (HT), osteoclast inhibitors (OI), and radiopharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, patients who present with multifocal bone metastases are treated first with medical therapies including narcotics, chemotherapy, HT, bisphosphonates, radiopharmaceuticals, and receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK) ligand inhibitors. EBRT is usually reserved for when a specific metastatic lesion causes significant local symptoms such as pain or creates a risk for pathological fracture or neurologic injury. Surgical stabilization can treat or prevent the morbidity of a pathologic fracture, particularly in weight-bearing bones. In addition, the alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy, radium 223 dichloride, has a place in the management of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, symptomatic bone metastases, and no known visceral metastatic disease.</p>
<p><em>Variant 1: 52-year-old man with a history of a T1N0M0 non-small-cell lung cancer. Two years after lobectomy, he is found to have a painful metastasis in the right femoral neck. The lesion is 3.5 cm in size with greater than 50% erosion of the medial bone cortex. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) 90. No other metastatic disease is found. He has had no previous therapy other than lobectomy.</em></p>
<p>This patient has newly diagnosed metastatic disease at a single site (femur), an excellent performance status, and has not previously received systemic therapy. Systemic therapy (including biologic agents, chemotherapy, and OI) will be critical for systemic disease control. However, he is at elevated risk of developing pathologic fracture in the near future and would benefit from immediate attention to the femoral lesion.</p>
<p>The most useful means of predicting the risk for pathologic fracture includes evaluation by a published scoring system based on anatomic site, degree of pain, type of lesion (blastic, mixed, lytic), and tumor size. Another simplified method of predicting pathologic fracture in the femur describes an elevated risk in lesions with &gt;3 cm cortical involvement.</p>
<p>This patient should be evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon for consideration of surgical stabilization of the femur. If he undergoes surgical stabilization, postoperative radiotherapy should be considered. If he does not undergo surgical stabilization, then immediate radiotherapy is indicated. The goals of therapy would be to control pain as well as preserve ambulatory function.</p>
<p>Radiation can be delivered to this site most efficiently through parallel opposed anterior and posterior fields. A strip of skin and soft tissue, as large as possible, should be spared to reduce the risk of long-term lower-extremity lymphedema, which can be associated with full-circumference extremity radiation.</p>
<p>This patient also has oligometastatic disease. The optimal management of oligometastases is an active area of research. Investigations comparing site-specific localized therapy to a more systemic approach with or without localized therapy are ongoing. Some have argued that patients with minimal sites of bone-only metastatic disease (deemed "oligometastatic") from certain disease may be treated with curative intent, though the data to confirm that stance are still to be accrued.</p>
<p>Single fraction radiotherapy (8 Gy &times; 1), when compared to higher-dose multifraction regimens, has been associated with a higher risk of postradiation pathologic fracture in femoral metastases. If this patient does not undergo surgical stabilization, then a higher-dose multifraction regimen would be reasonable. Local therapy should be followed by systemic therapy including consideration of OI. In light of the slight risk of jaw osteonecrosis associated with OI administration, a pretreatment dental evaluation to assess dentition and potential risk prior to OI use might be warranted (see Variant 1 above).</p>
<p><em>Variant 2: 62-year-old woman with estrogen-receptor positive/progesterone-receptor positive breast cancer, HER2/neu nonamplified. She develops a painful lytic bone metastasis in the right humerus after 4 years of a single-line of adjuvant hormonal therapy. There is minimal invasion of bone cortex, and the lesion is thought to have a low fracture risk per orthopedic surgery consult. KPS is 90. Bone scan demonstrates a few other asymptomatic bone metastases.</em></p>
<p>This patient has a good performance status and multiple sites of metastatic disease, but has a symptomatic lesion in a non-weight-bearing bone. This patient has a life expectancy that may be measured in years. This patient (as all patients) should receive appropriate analgesic therapy as a first-line treatment to provide rapid relief.</p>
<p>In general, the setup and prescription points for treatment should follow those outlined by the International Consensus on Palliative Radiotherapy Endpoints for future clinical trials, which were updated recently. Fluoroscopic simulation, computed tomography (CT) simulation, and clinical simulation are all acceptable methods for planning radiation fields. There are no data to suggest that highly conformal therapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), proton therapy, or brachytherapy would improve the outcome for this patient.</p>
<p>EBRT provides at least partial pain relief in 50% to 80% of patients, and most series suggest a rate of complete pain relief in about one-third of patients. Although a recent international survey showed 101 different dose schedules in common use for treating painful bone metastases with EBRT, the rates of pain relief are equivalent for fractionation schemes including 30 Gy in 10 fractions, 24 Gy in 6 fractions, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, and a single 8 Gy fraction. Single-fraction treatment optimizes patient convenience and reduces acute side effects but is associated with an approximate&nbsp;20% rate of retreatment to the same site compared to an 8% retreatment rate with the more prolonged courses.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of multifocal disease, systemic chemotherapy options should be explored, and current practice patterns also should include consideration of the use of OI. If both palliative radiotherapy and palliative systemic chemotherapy are to be delivered to this patient, they should be given sequentially rather than concurrently. OI have the ability to decrease the risk of skeletal-related events (fracture, need for surgery or radiation to bone, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy) as well as the ability to decrease pain from bone metastases and improve quality of life in patients with certain disease histologies. OI therapy is an adjunctive therapy to radiation. In addition, it may alleviate metastatic bone pain and is routinely administered indefinitely. Inhibiting osteoclast activity does not appear to impart a survival advantage. Recognized effects of the toxicities of potent OI include renal dysfunction (with intravenous bisphosphonates), hypocalcemia, and osteonecrosis of the jaw (see Variant 2 above).</p>
<p><em>Variant 3: 65-year-old woman with metastatic hormone-receptor positive breast cancer currently on hormonal and bisphosphonate therapy for skeletal-dominant metastatic disease. She received palliative radiation (30 Gy/10 fractions) to a painful lesion in the right humerus 3 years ago with good pain relief but now has recurrent pain at this site. Radiographs show a lytic lesion with no radiographic evidence of impending fracture. She has several other asymptomatic skeletal lesions and a new 1.5-cm lung metastasis.</em></p>
<p>This patient has pain at a site that has been previously irradiated. She had initial pain relief with treatment. Available data from multiple smaller, retrospective studies suggest that retreatment with EBRT may provide a reasonable chance of pain relief in 33% to 84% of patients. A recent meta-analysis of 10 studies, including data from 2,694 patients, estimated pain response in 58% of patients who received reirradiation for painful bone metastases. A recently completed international randomized prospective phase III trial compared a single-fraction (8 Gy x 1) reirradiation schedule to a multiple-fraction regimen (20 Gy in 5 to 8 fractions) in 850 patients with previously irradiated bone metastases. The majority of patients had prostate, breast, or lung cancers. The single-fraction regimen was not inferior to the multiple-fraction regimen with respect to pain control assessment at 2 months. Acute toxicities were worse in the multiple-fraction arm.</p>
<p>As in any case of reirradiation, care should be taken to avoid combined doses greater than the normal tissue tolerances of structures within the retreated volumes. The recurrence of pain in any long bone necessitates a reassessment of pathologic fracture risk before delivering reirradiation. Treatment should be planned to spare a skin and soft-tissue strip to minimize the risk of developing late chronic upper extremity lymphedema. Fluoroscopic simulation, CT simulation, and clinical simulation are all acceptable methods for planning radiation fields. There are no data to suggest that highly conformal therapy with IMRT, SBRT, brachytherapy, or proton therapy would improve the outcome for this patient.</p>
<p>Systemic chemotherapy can be considered depending on the patient's previous exposure to chemotherapy and her tolerance of further therapy. This patient's disease has progressed on bisphosphonates, and receptor activator of NF-kB (RANK) ligand inhibitors may be of use. If cytotoxic therapy is considered, it should be delivered sequentially with palliative radiotherapy rather than concurrently. Duration of radiation therapy should be weighed against the urgency of initiating a new line of systemic therapy. A shorter course of palliative reirradiation would potentially delay chemotherapy less than a longer treatment course.</p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines for the use of bone modifying agents in metastatic breast cancer recommend the use of OI, bisphosphonate or denosumab, be continued until there is evidence of substantial decline in the patient's clinical status. These drugs may reduce the risk of subsequent skeletal-related events and may aid in controlling bone pain. It is of note that in the pooled analysis of the phase III studies of denosumab versus zoledronic acid, denosumab demonstrated superiority in delaying the time to subsequent skeletal-related events with a relative risk of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.90) <em>P</em>&lt;0.001 (see Variant 3 above).</p>
<p><em>Variant 4: 66-year-old man with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. He has widespread osteoblastic skeletal disease with increasingly painful lesions in the lumbar spine, hips, and extremities. Prior therapy has included hormonal therapy, bisphosphonates, docetaxel chemotherapy, and EBRT to one of his painful hip lesions.</em></p>
<p>This patient has been heavily pretreated for metastatic prostate cancer and now has hormone-refractory disease. The patient may consider additional systemic therapy. As his bone metastases appear relatively symptomatic, Sipuleucel-T is not a likely next step. Abiraterone/prednisone and enzalutamide may be considered options if not used already. Note that enzalutamide is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for disease progression after docetaxel therapy. In addition, a clinical trial, cabozantinib, or mitoxantrone may be options for this individual depending on his goals of care, marrow reserve, and performance status.</p>
<p>Although it may be technically possible to deliver EBRT to multiple symptomatic lesions, his burden of disease suggests he may be a favorable candidate for radiopharmaceutical therapy. Multiple series have reported pain responses rates ranging from 45% to 80% with samarium-153 or strontium-89. An international prospective randomized trial of radium-223 versus placebo showed improvements in quality of life scores, decreased skeletal events, and improved overall survival with administration of radium-223.</p>
<p>The use of radiopharmaceuticals does not preclude the delivery of palliative EBRT. If this patient were to receive focused EBRT to painful lesions, it would be prudent to consider the volume of bone marrow within the treatment field given the potential for diffuse bone marrow suppression that has previously been reported with radiopharmaceuticals (see Variant 4 above.)</p>
<p><em>Variant 5: 47-year-old man with a history of malignant melanoma, now with a painful metastatic lesion in the left scapula. KPS is 70. He has had no prior therapy for metastatic disease. Staging scans show an asymptomatic 3-cm liver metastasis.</em></p>
<p>This patient has severe pain from a single site of bone metastases with a functional performance status. This patient (as with all patients) should receive appropriate analgesic therapy as first-line treatment to provide rapid symptom relief. Systemic therapy for melanoma is an evolving field, but overall prognosis remains poor. Melanoma is traditionally considered less sensitive to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The majority of studies evaluating radiotherapy for skeletal metastases consist of prostate, breast, and lung cancer patients. There is inadequate data available to determine whether tumor histologies traditionally thought of as "radioresistant" respond equally well to palliative radiotherapy as other more traditionally "radiosensitive" histologies. The ability of melanoma cell lines to repair sublethal DNA damage suggests melanoma may be more sensitive to large doses per fraction or a hypofractionated course of therapy.</p>
<p>Skin and soft-tissue sparing techniques should be utilized. A single treatment would minimize his time commitment, transportation requirements, and discomfort from being transferred on and off the treatment table. Fluoroscopic simulation, CT simulation, and clinical simulation are all acceptable methods for planning radiation fields. Treatment with large fractions might be more likely to cause a temporary pain flare, but anti-inflammatory medications are capable of minimizing this effect. There are no data to suggest that highly conformal therapy with IMRT, SBRT, brachytherapy, or proton therapy would improve the outcome for this patient (see Variant 5 above).</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>EBRT successfully provides rapid palliative relief from painful bone metastases in most cases. </li>
    <li>The acute side effects of palliative EBRT are usually minimal and self-limiting, whereas long-term side effects are uncommon and may not be clinically relevant in a patient group with limited life expectancy. </li>
    <li>Radiotherapy is not commonly recommended for asymptomatic bone metastases that are not associated with a risk of pathologic fracture as the primary goals of therapy are pain relief and functional preservation. </li>
    <li>Prospective randomized trials have proven equivalent pain relief with varied fractionation schemes, including 8 Gy in one fraction, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 24 Gy in 6 fractions, or 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Prolonged courses are associated with a lower incidence of retreatment, while shorter courses maximize patient and caregiver convenience by reducing the number of trips to the radiation department. </li>
    <li>Patients who undergo surgical stabilization for impending or completed pathologic fracture of a long bone may be treated with postoperative radiotherapy to 30 Gy in 10 fractions, 24 Gy in 6 fractions, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 8 Gy in a single fraction. </li>
    <li>Reirradiation with EBRT may be feasible and effective, though retreatment to sites including radiation-sensitive critical structures should include careful consideration of the cumulative radiation doses that may exceed normal tissue tolerance. Reirradiation with a single 8 Gy fraction is not inferior to multiple-fraction radiation and has less acute toxicity. </li>
    <li>Management of metastatic bone disease is palliative. A multidisciplinary team of care providers, including the palliative care team, should be available to the patient. Goals of care should be defined with the patient. Hospice referral should be considered if the life expectancy is 6 months or less, but this does not preclude the use of radiation for pain control. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rating Appropriateness</span></strong></p>
<p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria (AC) methodology is based on the RAND Appropriateness Method. The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures or treatments included in the AC topics are determined using a modified Delphi method. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. The expert panel members review the evidence presented and assess the risks or harms of doing the procedure balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure. The direct or indirect costs of a procedure are not considered as a risk or harm when determining appropriateness. When the evidence for a specific topic and variant is uncertain or incomplete, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence or may be the sole source for assessing the appropriateness.</p>
<p>The appropriateness is represented on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category "usually not appropriate" where the harms of doing the procedure outweigh the benefits; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category "usually appropriate" where the benefits of doing a procedure outweigh the harms or risks. The middle category, designated "may be appropriate," is represented by 4, 5, or 6 on the scale. The middle category is when the risks and benefits are equivocal or unclear, the dispersion of the individual ratings from the group median rating is too large (i.e., disagreement), the evidence is contradictory or unclear, or there are special circumstances or subpopulations which could influence the risks or benefits that are embedded in the variant.</p>
<p>The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating. To determine the panel's recommendation, the rating category that contains the median group rating without disagreement is selected. This may be determined after either the first or second rating round. If there is disagreement after the second rating round, the recommendation is "may be appropriate."</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to articulate his or her individual interpretations of the evidence or expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized and economical process. For additional information on the ratings process see the <a href="http://www.acr.org/%7E/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/RatingRoundInfo.pdf" title="ACR Web site">Rating Round Information</a> document on the ACR Web site.</p>

Potential Harms

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Recognized effects of the toxicities of potent osteoclast inhibitors (OI) include renal dysfunction (with intravenous bisphosphonates), hypocalcemia, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. In light of the slight risk of jaw osteonecrosis associated with OI administration, a pretreatment dental evaluation to assess dentition and potential risk prior to OI use might be warranted. </li>
    <li>External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is associated with a high risk of pathologic fracture without prophylactic internal fixation, as evaluated by certain criteria. </li>
    <li>The acute side effects of palliative EBRT are usually minimal and self-limiting, whereas long-term side effects are uncommon and may not be clinically relevant in a patient group with limited life expectancy. </li>
    <li>Single fraction raditherapy (8 Gy &times; 1), when compared to higher-dose multifraction regimens, has been associated with a higher risk of postradiation pathologic fracture in femoral metastases. </li>
    <li>Single-fraction treatment optimizes patient convenience and reduces acute side effects but is associated with about a 20% rate of retreatment to the same site compared to an 8% retreatment rate with the more prolonged courses. </li>
    <li>A recently completed international randomized prospective phase III trial compared a single-fraction (8 Gy &times; 1) reirradiation schedule to a multiple-fraction regimen (20 Gy in 5 to 8 fractions) in 850 patients with previously irradiated bone metastases. The majority of patients had prostate, breast, or lung cancers. The single-fraction regimen was not inferior to the multiple-fraction regimen with respect to pain control assessment at 2 months. Acute toxicities were worse in the multiple-fraction arm. </li>
    <li>Treatment with large fractions might be more likely to cause a temporary pain flare, but anti-inflammatory medications are capable of minimizing this effect. </li>
    <li>Retreatment to sites including radiation-sensitive critical structures should include careful consideration of the cumulative radiation doses that may exceed normal tissue tolerance. Reirradiation with a single 8 Gy fraction is not inferior to multiple-fraction radiation and has less acute toxicity. </li>
    <li>Treatment should be planned to spare a skin and soft-tissue strip to minimize the risk of developing late chronic upper extremity lymphedema. </li>
    <li>Radiopharmaceuticals have a potential for diffuse bone marrow suppression. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>An American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked.
