<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 50 years and older treated for a fracture with documentation of communication, between the physician treating the fracture and the physician or other clinician managing the patient's on-going care, that a fracture occurred and that the patient was or should be considered for osteoporosis treatment or testing. </p>
<p>This measure is reported by the physician who treats the fracture and who therefore is held accountable for the communication.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The single most powerful predictor of a future osteoporotic fracture is the presence of previous such fractures. Up to 50% of patients who suffer a first osteoporotic fracture will experience a subsequent fragility fracture during their life, often as early as 1 to 2 years after the first fracture (Center et al., 2007). Follow-up care after a fracture can substantially reduce the risk of re-fracture. However, the majority of patients with incident osteoporotic fractures are still not investigated or treated for their underlying condition (Giangregorio et al., 2006). Patients who experience fragility fractures should either be treated or screened for the presence of osteoporosis. Although the fracture may be treated by the orthopedic surgeon or hospitalist, the testing and/or treatment for osteoporosis is likely to be under the responsibility of a physician or clinician providing on-going care. It is important the physician or other clinician providing on-going care for the patient be made aware the patient has sustained a non-traumatic fracture. This measure aims to improve communication and coordination from the physician treating the fracture in the acute setting to the physician or clinician responsible for follow-up care of osteoporosis.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>The single most powerful predictor of a future osteoporotic fracture is the presence of previous such fractures, yet rates of investigation and treatment of osteoporosis in fragility fracture patients remain low (Elliot-Gibson et al., 2004), despite clear clinical practice guidelines calling for such treatment: </p>
<p><strong>The American Society of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) (Watts et al., 2010)</strong>: Recommends pharmacologic treatment for postmenopausal women with a hip or spine fracture (either clinical spine fracture or radiographic fracture).</p>
<p><strong>The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) (Cosman et al., 2014)</strong>: Recommends that all postmenopausal women 50 and older who have had a hip or vertebral fracture be treated for osteoporosis. The most common fractures are those of the vertebrae (spine), proximal femur (hip) and distal forearm (wrist). However, most fractures in older adults are due at least in part to low bone mass, even when they result from considerable trauma. The most notable exceptions are those of the fingers, toes, face and skull, which are primarily related to trauma rather than underlying bone strength. </p>
<p>Better communication and care coordination between the physician treating the initial fracture and physician or care team responsible for on-going management of the patient's condition has been found to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs (Bogoch et al., 2006; Marsh et al., 2011).</p></div>
