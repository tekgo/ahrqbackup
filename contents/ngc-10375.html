<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Treatment with dexamethasone is recommended for symptom relief in patients with primary high-grade gliomas and cerebral edema. </li>
    <li>Following surgery, a maximum dose of 16 mg daily, administered in four equal daily doses is recommended for symptomatic patients; this protocol should ideally be started by the neurosurgeon. </li>
    <li>Dexamethasone should be tapered in a manner individualized to each patient; the authors recommend one of three taper schedules:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Slow taper: starting with 4 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 2 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 1 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 1 mg once daily for 7 days. </li>
        <li>Fast taper: dexamethasone can be discontinued within 3 days of surgery. </li>
        <li>Individualized taper: a taper schedule individualized for a specific patient as decided upon by the physician. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Patients who have high-grade tumours, are symptomatic, or have a poor life expectancy, can be maintained on a 0.5&ndash;1.0 mg daily dose of dexamethasone. </li>
    <li>Side effects of dexamethasone are common, and increase in frequency and severity with increased dose and duration of therapy. Patients should be carefully monitored for endocrine, muscular, skeletal, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and hematologic complications, as well as for infections and other general side effects. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (patient or population, intervention, comparisons, outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>When should dexamethasone be considered in adult patients with high-grade gliomas? </li>
    <li>What are the optimal dose ranges? </li>
    <li>What is the optimal schedule for dexamethasone tapering? </li>
    <li>What are the most common adverse events associated with dexamethasone therapy, and how are they best managed? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Medical journal articles were searched using the Medline (1948 to Nov Week 3 2012), PubMed (1950-Nov 2012), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005 to Nov 2012), and CINAHL (1982 to Nov 2012) electronic databases. Search terms included: dexamethasone OR glucocorticoids OR corticosteroids OR decadron OR adrenal cortex hormones AND brain tumour or glioma OR high-grade glioma OR brain neoplasm. The reference lists of relevant articles were hand searched for additional articles. In addition to the Guideline Clearinghouse database, the websites of the following guideline developers were searched for relevant content: the American College of Radiology (ACR), the Australian Cancer Network, the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA), Cancer Care Ontario (CCO), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). A search of the grey literature was also conducted using Google and Google Scholar. The patient population was limited to adolescents and adults; there were no limitations by date, publication type, or study design. The literature search resulted in eight publications which were used to formulate the final recommendations addressing the first three guideline questions. To address the fourth guideline question, a systematic review of the literature was carried out incorporating the MeSH terms listed above in combination with the following keywords: hyperglycemia, myopathy, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, peptic ulceration, bowel perforation, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, mania, psychosis, depression, seizures, infections, <em>Pneumocystic jirovecii</em> pneumonia, candidiasis, venous thromboembolism, hypertension, cardiovascular complications, weight gain, Cushingoid, hirsutism, fragile skin, and skin complications.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of a medical oncologist, a pharmacist, and a Knowledge Management (KM) specialist, with input from an endocrinologist. A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>The working group drafted the recommendations and guideline, and distributed this document for review and comment to members of the Alberta Provincial CNS Tumour Team (N=30) via an anonymous electronic survey. The response rate was 33%.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The final guideline was reviewed and endorsed in February 2013 by the Alberta Provincial CNS Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
