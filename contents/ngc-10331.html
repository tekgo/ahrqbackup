<p>Laboratory results for <em>IFNL3</em> genotype are typically reported as reference single-nucleotide polymorphism identification number (rs) followed by the specific genotype (i.e., rs12979860 CC, CT, or TT) with accompanying interpretation (i.e., favorable genotype vs. unfavorable genotype).

<p><strong>Therapeutic Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Table 2 below summarizes the therapeutic recommendations for pegylated interferon &alpha; (PEG-IFN-&alpha;) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy based on <em>IFNL3</em> genotype. Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection varies throughout the world currently because some regions have access to the new direct-acting antivirals in combination with PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV, whereas other regions have access only to PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV. The role of <em>IFNL3</em> genotyping depends on treatment selection. <em>IFNL3</em> genotype is only one factor that can influence response rates to PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV therapy in HCV genotype 1 infection and should be interpreted in the context of other clinical and genetic factors.</p>
<p><em>PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV</em></p>
<p>For patients treated with PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV alone, <em>IFNL3</em> genotype is the strongest pretreatment predictor of HCV treatment response. In the intention-to-treat analysis of the original discovery cohort with rs12979860, Caucasian patients with CC genotype were more likely than those with CT or TT genotype to have undetectable serum viral RNA by week 4 (28 vs. 5 and 5%, respectively; P &lt;0.0001) and to achieve SVR (69% vs. 33% and 27%, respectively; P &lt;0.0001). Similar patterns were observed in Hispanic and African- American patients in this cohort. HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects, and the likelihood of response treatment influences shared decision making between clinicians and patients about initiating treatment.</p>
<p><em>Protease Inhibitor Combination Regimens&mdash;Treatment Naive</em></p>
<p>For treatment-naive patients with genotype 1 infection who are treated with protease inhibitor combinations, all <em>IFNL3</em> genotypes have improved response rates as compared with patients treated with PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV only. However, patients with the favorable <em>IFNL3</em> genotype still have higher response rates with the protease inhibitor combination in treatment-naive patients, and these response rates may guide patients and clinicians in their treatment decisions. In the boceprevir phase III treatment naive study of combination with PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV, SVR rates for rs12979860 CC patients receiving boceprevir ranged from 80 to 82% as compared with 65% to 71% for CT patients and 59&ndash;65% for TT patients. Moreover, multivariate regression analysis revealed that rs12979860 CC genotype was a predictor of SVR as compared with CT (odds ratio = 2.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.3&ndash;5.1) and TT genotypes (odds ratio = 2.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.2&ndash;3.7).</p>
<p><em>Role of the Lead-in</em></p>
<p>Although <em>IFNL3</em> genotype is the strongest pretreatment predictor of response to IFN-&alpha;-based therapy, the use of the early on-treatment antiviral response has also been extensively evaluated. The <em>IFNL3 </em>genotype is a marker for IFN responsiveness, and patients with the favorable <em>IFNL3</em> genotype are more likely to have significant reductions in HCV RNA during the first 4 weeks of therapy. The boceprevir combination regimen starts with 4 weeks of PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV, and boceprevir is added in the fifth week. In the analysis of the boceprevir phase III studies, SVR models that considered only baseline characteristics found that the <em>IFNL3</em> genotype was a predictor of SVR. When the lead-in response was added to these models, the <em>IFNL3</em> genotype was no longer a predictor. It has been proposed that these early kinetics minimize the value of the <em>IFNL3</em> genotype, but the lead-in response is known only for patients who have initiated therapy. For the patient who is considering whether or not to undergo HCV therapy with the boceprevir regimen, <em>IFNL3</em> genotype remains the most helpful predictor of likelihood of response.</p>
<p><em>Duration of Therapy</em></p>
<p>Duration of treatment is another important factor for clinicians and patients to consider before initiating PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV therapy because patients with favorable <em>IFNL3</em> genotypes are more likely to respond to shorter treatment courses. Patients receiving boceprevir are eligible for 24- to 28-week regimens instead of the standard 48-week regimen if HCV RNA is undetectable by week 8. In the boceprevir phase III clinical trial for treatment-naive patients, rs12979860 CC patients were more likely to have undetectable HCV RNA at week 8 (89%) than CT (53%) or TT (42%) patients. SVR rates ranged from 81% to 100% for all patients in whom HCV RNA was undetectable by week 8, regardless of <em>IFNL3</em> genotype. With telaprevir therapy, patients with undetectable HCV RNA by week 4 are eligible for a treatment regimen of only 24 weeks. Given the side-effect burden of PEG-IFN-&alpha; and RBV, the possibility of shorter treatment course may influence treatment choice for some patients.</p>
<p><em>Past Treatment</em></p>
<p>In general, patients who have failed previous IFN-&alpha;-based therapies are enriched for the unfavorable <em>IFNL3</em> genotype; therefore, <em>IFNL3</em> genotype is less likely to influence clinical decisions. Analysis of phase III boceprevir trial results for patients who were treatment experienced found that <em>IFNL3 </em>genotype did not predict SVR. In patients with unclear records of their previous treatment or with questions about the quality of care received in a previous course of therapy, the <em>IFNL3 </em>genotype can be considered a marker of IFN responsiveness that contributes to HCV treatment response.</p>
<p><em>IFNL3 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Concordance</em></p>
<p>Given that both rs12979860 and rs8099917 tests are available, clinicians may receive both pieces of data. The boceprevir phase III program conducted an analysis and found that combining rs12979860 and rs8099917 test results did not improve the strength of the association between the <em>IFNL3</em> genotype and SVR as compared with the results using rs12979860 genotype alone. This analysis also found instances of discordance between rs12979860 and rs8099917. Most rs12979860 CC patients had the favorable TT pattern at the rs8099917 locus. However, of the 426 patients with the favorable TT genotype at the rs8099917 locus, only 208 (48.8%) also had the favorable CC genotype at the rs12979860 locus. This analysis of the boceprevir program reported that both rs12979860 and rs8099917 predict SVR, but rs12979860 is more reliable in this group of patients.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<p><em>IFNL3</em> genotype is a strong predictor of treatment response for patients receiving treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, genotyping alone does not provide the basis for the decision to treat or not to treat HCV infection. Patients with all <em>IFNL3</em> genotypes can respond to HCV therapy, and the differences in outcome are reduced with the addition of protease inhibitors. <em>IFNL3</em> genotype is one of several factors to be considered when estimating the likelihood of treatment response. In addition, the side-effect profile of HCV regimens should be considered independently from the likelihood of response according to <em>IFNL3</em> genotype.</p>
