<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For staging please refer to the Appendix in the original guideline document (Balch et al., 2009).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral</span></strong></p>
<p>All patients who have malignant melanoma could be seen at a cancer treatment centre for assessment.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Referral is strongly encouraged for all patients with lesions 1 mm in thickness or greater, Clark IV or Clark V or if ulcerated. </li>
    <li>All patients with lesions less than 1 mm depth of invasion should be followed by their referring physician. </li>
    <li>It is expected that a referral will be forwarded to the cancer treatment centre regarding the patient's assessment. The referral will include the following (BC Cancer Agency, 2008):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Letter describing the clinical disease </li>

        <li>Operative reports (e.g., lymph node dissection and wide excision) </li>
        <li>Laboratory reports (e.g., liver function tests [LFT]) </li>
        <li>Information regarding other malignancies </li>
        <li>Imaging reports (e.g., chest x-ray) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-up and Surveillance</span></strong> (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2009)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>All patients are to be informed of signs of locoregional recurrence. </li>
    <li>Physicians who wish to be involved in the long-term follow-up of their patients may do so. </li>
    <li>Manual skin examination to be conducted by dermatologist. </li>
</ul>
<p>Stage-specific recommendations follow.</p>
<p><strong>In Situ Malignant Melanoma</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>At least annual skin exam for life. </li>
    <li>Educate patient on monthly skin self exam. </li>
    <li>The patient may be seen in the cancer clinic then discharged to the referring physician.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>History and physical exam (with emphasis on nodes and skin). </li>
        <li>Exam should ensure adequate excision of the original lesion and include a review of skin self examination. </li>
        <li>No routine investigation is indicated; radiologic imaging may be used to investigate specific signs or symptoms. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lesions Less Than 1 mm</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>At least annual skin exam for life. </li>
    <li>History and physical examination (with emphasis on nodes and skin) every 6 to 12 months in the first year, with subsequent full skin exams annually for life. </li>
    <li>Educate patient in monthly self skin and lymph node exam. </li>
    <li>The patient may be seen in the cancer clinic then discharged to the referring physician.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The patient should have a history and physical examination with full skin review carried out every 6 months for the first year and then annually. </li>
        <li>No routine investigation is indicated; radiologic imaging may be used to investigate specific signs or symptoms; an initial chest x-ray for documentation and future comparison is optional. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intermediate and Thick Lesions (Lesions &lt;1.0 mm with Ulceration or Lesions 1.0&ndash;4.0 mm and &gt;4 mm)</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>At least annual skin exam for life. </li>
    <li>Educate patient in monthly self skin and lymph node exam. </li>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>History and physical examination (with emphasis on nodes and skin) at least every 6 months for the first 3 years, annually for the next 2 years, and then annually as clinically indicated. </li>
        <li>Computed tomography (CT) scan to follow-up for specific signs and symptoms. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proven Nodal Metastases</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The patient should be followed at the cancer centre at a frequency determined by the attending physician depending on the treatment plan. </li>
    <li>History and physical examination (with emphasis on nodes and skin) every 3 to 6 months for 3 years, then every 4 to 12 months for 2 years, then annually as clinically indicated. </li>
    <li>Additional investigations (e.g., blood work, imaging, etc.) as per symptoms </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage IV: Lesions of Any Thickness with Proven Distant Metastases</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The patient should be followed at the cancer centre at a frequency determined by the attending physician depending on the treatment plan. </li>
    <li>History and physical examination (with emphasis on nodes and skin) every 3 to 6 months for 3 years, then every 4 to 12 months for 2 years, then annually as clinically indicated. </li>
    <li>Additional investigations (e.g., blood work, imaging, etc.) as per symptoms. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patients Receiving Interferon Therapy</strong></p>
<p>The patient will be seen by the attending medical oncologist monthly during the year of treatment, every 3 months for&nbsp;two more visits and then every 6 months thereafter in the outpatient clinic.</p>
<p><strong>Ocular Melanoma</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients with ocular melanoma will be assessed by the referring ophthalmologist and receive an initial assessment in the clinic. </li>
    <li>Subsequent follow up will be once yearly for 5 years and consist of a history and physical exam, liver function studies, a chest x-ray and an ultrasound. </li>
    <li>For uveal melanoma, a reasonable consensus protocol is 6-monthly follow-up, with full clinical examination. Liver imaging, LFTs, and possibly a plain chest radiograph may be undertaken regularly or intermittently as clinically indicated (National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC], 2008). </li>
    <li>For conjunctival melanoma, due to the high likelihood of recurrence or new ocular lesions, indefinite biannual assessment is recommended; these patients should be followed-up for life (NHMRC, 2008). </li>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (Patient or Population, Intervention, Comparisons, Outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Which patients should be referred to the cancer treatment centre? </li>
    <li>What should the referral consist of? </li>
    <li>What is the appropriate duration of follow-up? </li>
    <li>What are the recommended follow-up intervals? </li>
    <li>What should be assessed during follow-up? </li>
    <li>Who should conduct the follow-up? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE (1966 through January 2011), CINAHL, Cochrane, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Abstracts and proceedings, and CANCERLIT databases were searched. The search included practice guidelines, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and clinical trials. Search terms included: monitoring, surveillance, follow up, ultrasound or ultrasonography, referral, and malignant melanoma.</p>
<p>For the 2013 update of the guideline, PubMed was searched for evidence on follow-up in cutaneous melanoma. The search term "melanoma" was used and results were limited to clinical trials, published between January 2012 and January 2013. Citations were hand-searched for relevant studies.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulate the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>Following a review of the evidence by the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team, no changes to the recommendations were made.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it will be sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
