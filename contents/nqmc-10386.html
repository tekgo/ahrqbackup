Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This indicator is intended to flag cases of complications that arise due to technical difficulties in medical care, specifically those involving an accidental puncture or laceration.</p>
<p>Accidental laceration or puncture is a health outcome measure. This measure captures an injury to an organ (e.g., bowel, bladder, liver, diaphragm) or blood vessel that was entirely unintended and was NOT due to an underlying disease process. This definition would be met if (for example) placement of a retractor underneath the symphysis pubis accidentally enters the bladder. Another example would be use of a cautery device or scissors to dissect a tissue plane that errantly causes an injury to underlying bowel. The rationale for this measure is that these injuries have adverse consequences for patients, and are often preventable. </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Using data from 19 states from 2006 to 2008 over five million pediatric hospitalizations were examined. Pediatric patients who experienced an adverse event had a 6.15% mortality rate and excess cost of $1.3 billion. This Quality Indicator (QI) was one of the highest volume events. The trend in this QI worsened over time and was one of the most variable across the hospitals studied (Reed &amp; May, 2010). More recently, data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project from 2000 to 2007 were used to examine trends in pediatric care (Friedman et al., 2011). Accidental puncture and laceration increased 25.6% from 2000 to 2007, with the largest increase for children between the ages of 5 and 14 years. However, the authors did caution that "present on admission data" were not used and the sample of hospitals varied over the years. </p>
<p>Pediatric Quality Indicator (PDI) 01 functions appropriately in pediatric populations to identify adverse events that are associated with excess length of stay and total charges. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1998 to 2005 and the KIDS Inpatient Database from 1997, 2000, and 2003, Camp and colleagues (2010) identified 6,459 unique records flagged by PDI 01, and matched them with 19,377 control records with the same age, race, gender, and hospital identification code. Multiple regression analyses were performed for inpatient mortality, length of stay and total hospital charges (controlling for procedure category, admission type, and insurance status in the matched case-control data set). Adjusted for procedure category, admission type, and insurance status, patients with PDI 01 were more likely to die (odds ratio [OR]: 1.9., P less than 0.001), had a 4.81 day longer length of stay (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.26 to 5.36, P less than 0.001), and had $36,291 higher total hospital charges (95% CI: $32,583 to $40,000, P less than 0.001) compared with patients without PDI 01. </p>
<p>In a similar study using nearest-neighbor propensity score matching in the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2006 (an administrative database with data from 38 academic, nonprofit pediatric hospitals affiliated with the Child Health Corporation of America), Kronman and colleagues (2008) reported mean excess length of stay of 2.77 days and mean excess total charges of $34,884 for each PDI 01 case, relative to matched controls. The excess charges came from all hospital cost centers, including pharmacy ($7,705), supplies ($1,718), laboratory ($7,622), imaging ($1,956), and other clinical activities ($4,827). </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Includes approximately 6 million pediatric discharges for 2,500 hospitals ("Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [HCUP] State Inpatient Databases [SID]," 2008).</p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. The signal to noise ratio is the ratio of the between hospital variance (signal) to the within hospital variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). The ratio itself is only a diagnostic for the degree of variance in the risk-adjusted rate systematically associated with the provider. Therefore, what matters is the magnitude of the variance in the "smoothed" rate (that is, the variance in the risk-adjusted rate after the application of the univariate shrinkage estimator based on the signal ratio). </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. What the data demonstrate is systematic variation in the provider level rate of 0.301 to 1.191 per 1,000 from the 5th to 95th percentile after a signal ratio of 0.608 is applied as the shrinkage estimator (that is, after accounting for variation due to random factors). </p>
<p>California data from 2005 to 2007, which were used because they included "present on admission" data and allowed for hospital specific calculations, were used to determine the percentage of hospitals with appropriate patient volumes to readily use the Quality Indicator (QI) for tracking performance measurement over time. Only 12 of 399 California hospitals (3.0%), with 27% of the eligible discharges statewide, had sufficient patient volume to detect a hypothetical doubling of the Pediatric Quality Indicator (PDI) 01 rate. This problem could be minimized by focusing public reporting of this indicator on hospitals that meet a minimum pediatric volume threshold, or by incorporating it into a more robust composite measure (Bardach, Chien, &amp; Dudley, 2010).</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. The most recent study of the criterion validity of PDI 01 was based on a consecutive sample of 295 flagged cases from 28 participating hospitals in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions (NACHRI) from 2003 through 2005 (Scanlon et al., 2008). Records were reviewed independently by clinicians at each site, who lacked formal training but were guided by teleconference discussions. A previous review of 119 flagged cases from 14 self-selected children's hospitals in the NACHRI Pediatric Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) Collaborative (Scanlon et al., 2006) used similar methods.</p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Calculation of the positive predictive value, which is defined as the percentage of reported events that are confirmed as true events based upon application of a "criterion (gold) standard." Sensitivity is defined as the percentage of all eligible events (based upon the same criterion standard) that are reported by hospitals in the administrative data set used for validation. In the cited studies, the criterion standard was based on review of randomly or chronologically sampled medical records by an experienced clinician, using a standard data collection tool and guidelines.</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. The larger, more recent study published in 2008 estimated a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84%, which is very consistent with the PPV estimates for the adult version of this indicator (e.g., 85% [95% confidence interval (CI), 77% to 91%] and 91% [95% CI, 88% to 94%] for PSI 15). Fewer details are reported from the earlier (Scanlon et al., 2006) study, but Table 1 in that paper suggests a PPV of 64% to 86%. </p>
<p>False positive rates were low, as reported for PSI 15. Some false positives were due to complications that were actually present on admission (i.e., 20 of 48 false positives in the NACHRI study), which would automatically be excluded by users with "present on admission" (POA) data. Adjusting for the availability of POA data, the estimated PPV in the 2008 NACHRI study was 90%. The remaining false positives were either non-accidental injuries (e.g., deliberate disruption of tissue to achieve surgical goals) or injuries unrelated to a puncture or laceration. </p>
<p>No data about the sensitivity of PDI 01 are available at this time, although the limited data presented for PSI 15 may also pertain to PDI 01. </p>
<p>Although precise proportions were difficult to estimate, many of the true-positive cases may not have been preventable because adhesions were associated with 8% of cases and because the goals of the operation in some cases may have warranted an increased risk of unintentional damage to other structures. For example, it was reported that many of these children "had congenital abnormalities such as gastroschisis, omphalocele, diaphragmatic hernias, cloacal defects, and cardiac defects" and they "were coming back into the hospital for 1 of multiple procedures that had previously involved significant scarring. Although the laceration or puncture was not a therapeutic part of the surgery, clinicians felt that they may have been unavoidable for the surgeon to do what was necessary. Incidents that were clearly &hellip; preventable were often complications of line or device placements that punctured vessels, lungs, or the gastrointestinal tract."</p>
<p>Face validity was systematically assessed using an expert panel process, as described in our original submission documents (McDonald et al., 2006). The methodology for the structured review was adapted from the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and consisted of an initial independent assessment of each indicator by clinician panelists using an initial questionnaire, a conference call among all panelists, followed by a final independent assessment by clinician panelists using the same questionnaire. Specifically, this indicator was reviewed by two panels with a total of 18 physicians, including a pediatric specialty panel with one neonatologist, one infectious disease specialist, one ambulatory pediatrician, one hospitalist, one cardiovascular surgeon, one oncologist, two surgeons, one interventional radiologist, and one critical care physician. Median ratings were 7 (on a scale of 1 to 9) with indeterminate agreement on usefulness for internal quality improvement, 6.5 with indeterminate agreement for comparative reporting, and 7 with indeterminate agreement for preventability.</p>

Description of Allowance for Patient or Population Factors

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The predicted value for each case is computed using a hierarchical model (logistic regression with hospital random effect) and covariates for gender, birthweight (500g groups), age in days (29 to 60, 61 to 90, 91+), age in years (in 5-year age groups), modified Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Classifications Software (CSS) comorbidities. The reference population used in the regression is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Data (SID) for the year 2008, a database consisting of 43 states and approximately 6 million pediatric discharges. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., hospital). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population rate. </p>
