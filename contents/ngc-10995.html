<p>In case of urine leakage or retracted penis consider a MEC with special features (see Chapter 6.3 of original guideline document). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Principles of Management of Nursing Intervention</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients with cognitive impairment should be carefully assessed to determine if they are able to fit and manage a MEC. (Pomfret, 2003) (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Measure the length and the circumference of the penis at its widest point to fit the MEC in the correct way. (<strong>LE=4, GR=A*</strong>) </li>
    <li>Assess the correct length of the inlet tube, taking into account whether the patient is a wheelchair user, a walker or bedridden. (<strong>LE=4, GR=A*</strong>) </li>
    <li>Assess hand function of the patient and valve taps before choosing a urinary bag for the MEC. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Shorten pubic hair to prevent it being caught in the sheath. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Skin should be observed before fitting a MEC. </li>
    <li>Skin should be observed after MEC is applied. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Avoid creams and powders as they affect the adhesion of the MEC. (Kyle, 2011) (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Hydrocolloid could help healing if skin is damaged. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Skin should be observed after removing the MEC. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>The information offered in these guidelines was obtained through a systematic literature search and a review of current procedures undertaken in various member countries of the European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN).</p>
<p>The initial search was done in December 2014 by a nurse specialist.</p>
<p><strong>Databases</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>PubMed </li>
    <li>CINAHL </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Male external catheters </li>
    <li>Condom catheters </li>
    <li>Urinary sheaths </li>
    <li>External urinary catheter </li>
</ul>
<p>In July 2015 an additional search was performed by another nurse specialist.</p>
<p><strong>Databases</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>EMBASE </li>
    <li>CINAHL </li>
    <li>Cochrane </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Terms</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Male external catheters </li>
    <li>Condom catheters </li>
    <li>Urinary sheaths </li>
    <li>External urinary catheter </li>
    <li>Complications </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of the lack of medical subject headings, (MeSH) the searches were performed with free text for male external catheter and condom catheter as well as urinary sheaths.</p>
<p>The search results were not limited to randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, meta-analyses or systematic reviews. Additional searches were not limited to any level of evidence (LE). For the practical aspects of male external catheter (MEC) application (see Appendices in the original guideline document), brochures from manufacturers were used.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations of the Search</span></strong></p>
<p>The search and data extraction were based on PICO (patient problem or population [P], intervention [I], comparison [C] and outcome [O]) questions formulated by the Working Group (see Chapter 14 in the original guideline document for a list of the PICO questions).</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of December 2014 Search</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>English language </li>
    <li>Adults </li>
    <li>Human studies </li>

    <li>Conference proceedings </li>
    <li>Paediatric studies </li>
    <li>Use of MECs for diagnostic reasons </li>
</ul>
<p>It was a policy decision to restrict the search in the way described. After screening the records retrieved from the search of December 2014 (limited to 2004-2014), it was decided to do an additional search without limitation of year. However, it was decided not to use articles from before 2000 for the text on complications because those studies might have been performed with catheters made from material that is no longer used. After review, papers used in the original guidelines (2008) were included where text remained unchanged.</p>
<p>In the process of working with the articles, new references were found and added to the reference list, if they were relevant to the topic and cited in the text.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rating System</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations provided in this document are based on a rating system modified from that produced by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (OCEBM) in 2011. External data extractors used the European Association of Urology (EAU) data-extraction system for critical assessment of the papers identified.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, the Working Group graded treatment recommendations using a three-grade system (grade of recommendation; GR A-C) and inserted levels of evidence (LE) to help readers assess the validity of the statements made. The aim of this practice is to ensure a clear transparency between the underlying evidence and the recommendations given. This system is further described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields. Much of the evidence is weak, therefore, the Working Group decided to upgrade some of the recommendations. Upgraded recommendations are marked 'A*' meaning that the panel has agreed to recommend this even though the LE is 4.</p>
<p>Some of the literature was not easy to grade. However, if the Working Group thought that the information would be useful in practice, it was ranked as LE 4. Low-level evidence indicated that no higher level of evidence was found in the literature when writing the guidelines, but it cannot be regarded as an indication of the importance of the topic or recommendation for daily practice.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Working Group of these updated guidelines consists of nurse specialists, with support from the European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) Central Office and a urologist for the Indications chapter.</p>
<p>The scope of these guidelines was established at the start of the writing process. Six PICO (patient problem or population [P], intervention [I], comparison [C] and outcome [O]), questions were posed to guide the literature review process (see Chapter 14 in the original guideline document for a list of the PICO questions).</p>
<p>The Working Group aims to develop guidelines for evidence-based nursing, as defined by Behrens (2004): "Integration of the latest, highest level scientific research into the daily nursing practice, with regard to theoretical knowledge, nursing experience, the ideas of the patient and available resources." The recommendations in these guidelines are based on synthesis of evidence from the articles. The Working Group based the text on the evidence of the articles whenever possible, but if evidence was missing, it was based on best practice and consensus.</p>
<p>Four components that influence nursing decisions can be distinguished: personal clinical experience of the nurse; existing resources; patient wishes and ideas; and results of nursing science. This statement implies that, although literature is important, the experience of nurses and patients is also necessary for decision making. Consequently, it is not only the written guidelines that are relevant for nursing practice.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>These guidelines, in which the Working Groups includes clear illustrations, detailed application procedures and extensive references, will help healthcare professionals to identify potential problem areas in the assessment, application and removal of male external catheters (MECs).</p>
<p>More specifically, these guidelines aim to support healthcare professionals in the prevention of complications of male external catheters, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), irritative and allergic symptoms, compressive symptoms and pressure sores, skin lesions and leakage, and contribute to improving the quality of life (QoL) of MEC users.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The complications related to the application of a male external catheter (MEC) for urinary drainage may be classified as irritative, allergic or compressive in aetiology. In a study of men with spinal cord injury complications related to improper use of MECs were seen in 15% of patients. Most of the complications resulted from the use of rubber ducts with a penile sheath. Even though MEC products have developed a lot since 1981, complications are still reported (refer to Table 3 in the original guideline document). The risk of complications is inevitably larger in patients with spinal cord injury because of decreased sensation. </li>
    <li>There are conflicting results when it comes to deciding if the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) is lower in men using MECs compared to indwelling catheters. It is estimated that the incidence of UTI is 40% in men using MECs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 5 of the original guideline document contains more detailed information on complications of MEC.</p>

<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Contraindications to male external catheter (MEC) are few and can be divided into absolute and relative.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Absolute Contraindications</span></strong></p>
<p>The only absolute contraindication to the use of MEC devices is the known presence of high pressure chronic retention which may be the underlying causative pathology of urinary incontinence (UI). Whilst the use of MEC devices in such a scenario may contain the symptom of UI, it will not influence the high intravesical pressure and resultant impact on renal function and as such a more invasive definitive therapy should be employed.</p>
<p>The use of conventional cystometry will delineate the intravesical pressure but simple renal tract ultrasound scan will demonstrate the hall mark feature of bilateral hydroureteronephrosis even before a decline in renal function is manifest.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relative Contraindications</span></strong></p>
<p>Relative contraindications are more reflective of the fact that most clinical scenarios are better managed with alternative means, e.g., low pressure chronic retention or bladder atonia are better managed with either long term catheterisation or intermittent catheterisation but if these are unsuitable or if the patient insists, the use MEC devices are viable since the intravesical pressure is low and thus the upper renal tract is safe. With MEC devices, however, the bladder in these circumstances will fail to drain and increase the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI), stones, etc.; thus whilst possible, this containment method is far from ideal.</p>
<p>Other limiting and relative contraindications for the use of MEC include dermatological issues such as excoriated penile skin, psoriasis and localised allergy to materials used as well as cognitive impairment, as such patient may traumatically avulse the MEC resulting in loss of skin integrity.</p>
<p>Body habitus may form a relative contraindication for some patients as a consequence of a physical inability to apply the device or perhaps visualise the penis thus hindering adequate application. In general patients with a high body mass index (BMI) are at greater risk of this as a combined consequence of blocked vision due to abdominal girth and a prominent supra public fat pad causing loss of visible and accessible penile length upon which to place the MEC.</p></div>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) Guidelines Working Group has prepared these guidelines to help nurses assess evidence-based management and incorporate the recommendations into their clinical practice. These guidelines are not meant to be prescriptive, nor will adherence to them guarantee a successful outcome in all cases. Ultimately, decisions regarding care must be made on a case-by-case basis by healthcare professionals after consultation with their patients and colleagues, and using their clinical judgement, evidence-based knowledge, and expertise.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations of Document</span></strong></p>
<p>The EAUN acknowledges and accepts the limitations of this document. It should be emphasised that the current guidelines provide information about treatment of individual patients according to a standardised approach. The information should be considered as providing recommendations without legal implications. The intended readership is practising nurses and other healthcare professionals. Cost-effectiveness considerations are best addressed locally and therefore fall outside the remit of these guidelines.</p></div>
