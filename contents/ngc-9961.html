Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of evidence (<strong>A&ndash;C</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>I&ndash;IV</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Esophageal Cancer</strong></p>
<p><em>Class I Recommendation</em>: Flexible endoscopy with biopsy is the primary method for the diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma. <strong>(Level of Evidence B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Staging of Esophageal Cancer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For the remaining recommendations, the following definitions will be used: early stage cancer refers to nodular high-grade dysplasia or T1a as defined by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS); locoregionalized esophageal cancer refers to esophageal cancers from T1b to T4, any N, and M0; and distant metastatic disease refers to M1 disease.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Class I Recommendation</em>: For early stage esophageal cancer, computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen is an optional test for staging. <strong>(Level of Evidence B)</strong> </li>
    <li><em>Class I Recommendation</em>: For locoregionalized esophageal cancer, CT of the chest and abdomen is a recommended test for staging. <strong>(Level of Evidence B)</strong> </li>
    <li><em>Class IIB Recommendation</em>: For early stage esophageal cancer, positron emission tomography (PET) is an optional test for staging. <strong>(Level of Evidence B)</strong> </li>
    <li><em>Class I Recommendation</em>: For locoregionalized esophageal cancer, PET is a recommended test for staging. <strong>(Level of Evidence B)</strong> </li>
    <li><em>Class IIA Recommendation</em>: In the absence of metastatic disease, EUS is recommended to improve the accuracy of clinical staging. <strong>(Level of Evidence B)</strong> </li>
    <li><em>Class IIA Recommendation</em>: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) should be considered as a diagnostic/staging tool for small, discrete nodules or areas of dysplasia when the disease appears limited to the mucosa or submucosa as assessed by EUS. <strong>(Level of Evidence B)</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Metastasis</strong></p>
<p><em>Class IIB Recommendation</em>: For locally advanced (T3/T4) adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction infiltrating the anatomic cardia or Siewart type III esophagogastric tumors, laparoscopy is recommended to improve the accuracy of staging. <strong>(Level of Evidence C)</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Level of Evidence That Best Fits the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong>: Multiple populations evaluated. Data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong>: Limited populations evaluated. Data derived from a single randomized trial or non-randomized studies.</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong>: Very limited populations evaluated. Only consensus opinion of experts, case studies, or standard of care are available.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I (benefit &gt; &gt; &gt; risk)</strong>: Procedure/treatment SHOULD be performed/administered.</p>
<p><strong>Class IIA (benefit &gt; &gt; risk)</strong>: Additional studies with focused objectives needed. IT IS REASONABLE to perform procedure/administer treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Class IIB (benefit &gt; risk)</strong>: Additional studies with broad objectives needed; additional registry data would be helpful. Procedure/treatment MAY BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p><strong>Class III (no benefit)</strong>: Procedure/test, not helpful. Treatment, no proven benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV (harm)</strong>: Procedure, without benefit or harmful. Treatment, harmful to patients.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For this systematic review on the diagnosis and staging of esophageal cancer, specific search terms were identified and targeted searches were run in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases in June 2011. The results were limited to publications since 1990, and human subjects. The authors augmented the computerized literature search by manually reviewing the reference lists of identified studies and relevant reviews. In addition, the writing group identified articles from personal files. The following three medical subject heading (MeSH) terms were used: "esophageal neoplasms," "early detection of cancer," and "neoplasm staging." Additional search strategies incorporated the MeSH subheadings of "analysis," "anatomy and histology," "classification," "diagnosis," "diagnostic use," "histology," "methods," "pathology," "standards," "trends," "ultrasonography," "positron emission tomography," and "trends."</p>
<p>In all, 4,064 articles and abstracts were identified through the initial EMBASE search, and 2,874 articles were identified through PubMed/MEDLINE. The Cochrane database identified 2 additional reviews and 191 clinical trials. Abstracts were reviewed by at least two authors and excluded if data were duplicative, not specifying esophageal cancer, purely descriptive, or incomplete. The resulting 80 articles served as the source for the review; 46 are cited and the remaining are listed in the appendix in the original guideline document.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate diagnosis and staging of patients with esophageal cancer </li>
    <li>There is increasing evidence that multimodality therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both, followed by esophagectomy) has increased survival benefits when compared with surgery alone for more advanced stages. Accurate staging information is thus critical for the determination of appropriate therapeutic intervention. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Endoscopic Ultrasonography</strong></p>
<p>As endoscopic ultrasound probes are typically larger in size, care should be used when attempting biopsies in the setting of stricture, in particular when dilating the tumor stricture.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Endoscopic Mucosal Resection</strong></p>
<p>Perforation risk and bleeding risk are the most relevant and range from less than 1% to 2%, respectively.</p></div>
