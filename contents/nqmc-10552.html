<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This patient safety measure addresses medication management to prevent the harms associated with certain medications in the elderly. It identifies high-risk medications that should be avoided in the elderly population. Certain medications are associated with increased risk of harms from drug side-effects and drug toxicity, and pose a concern for patient safety (McLeod et al., 1997; Murray, 2000; Roose &amp; Spatz, 1999). There is clinical consensus that these drugs pose increased risks in the elderly (Graal &amp; Wolffenbuttel, 1999; Zhan et al., 2001; Fick et al., 2003). </p>
<p>The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) used the 2012 American Geriatrics Society (AGS)&nbsp;Updated Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults as a clinical foundation for this measure. The development of the 2012 Updated Beers Criteria was based on an extensive literature review and discussion by a panel of experts in geriatric care and pharmacotherapy. The Updated Beers Criteria is intended as a tool that both identifies and describes drugs and drug-disease interactions that should generally be avoided in people 65 years of age and older, because these drugs pose unnecessary risk for older adults (AGS 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2012). </p>
<p>Appropriate use of prescription drugs in the elderly, including proper drug selection, has been identified as an important quality of care issue, and explicit criteria defining inappropriate drug use as an important tool in the evaluation of prescribing to populations (Graal &amp; Wolffenbuttel, 1999; Zhan et al., 2001). Studies link prescription drug use by the elderly with adverse drug events that contribute to hospitalization, increased length of hospital stay, increased duration of illness, nursing home placement and falls and fractures that are further associated with physical, functional and social decline in the elderly (Fu, Liu, &amp; Christensen, 2004; Bates, 1999).</p>
<p>Reducing prescriptions of high-risk drugs in the elderly also represents an opportunity to reduce the costs associated with the harm from medications (e.g., hospitalizations from drug toxicity) and to encourage clinicians to consider safer, alternative medications. Reducing unnecessary prescribing will also help to reduce cost, given that the elderly population represents one-third of all prescription drug expenditures in the United States (U.S.), but comprises only 13 percent of the population (Families USA, 2000).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Prescription drug use by the elderly can often result in adverse drug events that contribute to hospitalization, increased duration of illness, nursing home placement, falls and fractures. Despite widely accepted medical consensus that certain drugs increase the risk of harm to the elderly (Fick et al., 2003), these drugs continue to be prescribed. Because older adults are more likely to take multiple medications for multiple conditions, they are also at higher risk of potentially harmful drug-disease interactions. </li>
    <li>Health care costs linked to prescriptions of potentially inappropriate medications in the elderly average $7.2 billion a year (Fu et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Almost 40 percent of adults 65 and older report being on five or more medications (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], 2014). </li>
    <li>Approximately 15 percent of adverse drug events occur in the elderly; 28 percent of hospitalizations of older adults are due to inappropriate use of medications (Pretorius et al., 2013; American Geriatrics Society [AGS], 2011). </li>
    <li>Avoiding the use of high-risk drugs is an important, simple and effective strategy in reducing medication-related problems and adverse drug events in older adults (AGS, 2012). </li>

The intent is to sum the days supply for all medications (listed in the Prescription column) within a medication class (listed in the Description column). Sum the days supply and subtract any days supply that extends beyond December 31 of the measurement year. If the total days supply for all medications in a medication class is greater than 90 days, count as one high-risk medication. Assess each medication class separately. Medications dispensed in the year prior to the measurement year with a days supply that extends into the measurement year count toward the total days supply. </li>
    <li><em>Calculating Average Daily Dose</em>: Calculate the average daily dose for medications in Table DAE-C. Multiply the quantity of pills dispensed by the dose of each pill and divide by days supply. To calculate daily dose for elixirs and concentrates, multiply the volume dispensed by dose and divide by days supply. Two prescriptions for the same medication that meet the average daily dose criteria count as one high-risk medication. Two prescriptions for different medications that meet the average daily dose criteria count as two high-risk medications. Do not round when calculating average daily dose. </li>
