Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, with a diagnosis of cancer who have undergone brachytherapy or external beam radiation therapy who have a treatment summary report in the chart that was communicated to physician(s) providing continuing care and to the patient within one month completing treatment.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Timely, accurate, and effective communications are critical to quality and value in contemporary medical practices. As both a consultant oncologist and the provider of radiation oncology services, the radiation oncologist has a dual role. Radiation therapy incorporates the science of complex, integrated treatment delivery and the art of individual cancer management. Through written focused reports and direct communications, the contribution of radiation oncologists concerning patient care, responsible utilization, and quality are provided, especially to primary care physicians, other oncologists and specialists, and allied healthcare providers (nurses, tumor registrars, quality assurance personnel, third-party reviewers, etc).* (American College of Radiology [ACR])</p>

<p class="Note">*The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <u>verbatim</u> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:</p>

<p class="Note">A summary should be generated that accurately describes the treatment process, the doses delivered to the target/tumor volume and other key organs, relevant assessment of tolerance to and progress towards the treatment goals, and subsequent care plans. The style will reflect the radiation oncologist's individual practice convention and the referral provider's needs. The style, content, and detail of this summary must be tailored to the clinical setting and prevailing practice norms. It should contain elements that accurately and succinctly reflect the program of care administered in a language understandable to the nonradiation oncologist. It is suggested that, the report to the referring physician include a request for periodic updates on the patient's progress. These updates will facilitate continuity of care should the patient require further radiation therapy. (ACR)</p></div>
