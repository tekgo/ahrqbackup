Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the classification of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>1-3</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the expected diagnostic yield for vestibular schwannomas when using a magnetic resonance image (MRI) to evaluate patients with previously published definitions of asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adults with an asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss on audiometric testing.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: On the basis of an audiogram, it is recommended that MRI screening on patients with &ge;10 decibels (dB) of interaural difference at 2 or more contiguous frequencies or &ge;15 dB at 1 frequency be pursued to minimize the incidence of undiagnosed vestibular schwannomas. However, selectively screening patients with &ge;15 dB of interaural difference at 3000 Hz alone may minimize the incidence of MRIs performed that do not diagnose a vestibular schwannoma.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the expected diagnostic yield for vestibular schwannomas when using an MRI to evaluate patients with asymmetric tinnitus, as defined as either purely unilateral tinnitus or bilateral tinnitus with subjective asymmetry?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adults with subjective complaints of asymmetric tinnitus.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: It is recommended that MRI be used to evaluate patients with asymmetric tinnitus. However, this practice is low yielding in terms of vestibular schwannoma diagnosis (&lt;1%).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the expected diagnostic yield for vestibular schwannomas when using an MRI to evaluate patients with a sudden sensorineural hearing loss</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adults with a verified sudden sensorineural hearing loss on an audiogram.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: It is recommended that MRI be used to evaluate patients with a sudden sensorineural hearing loss. However, this practice is low yielding in terms of vestibular schwannoma diagnosis (&lt;3%).</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014. Three electronic databases were searched (PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science). Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the medical librarian using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies (see Figure 1 and Table 1 in the full guideline [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Eight hundred and six citations were manually reviewed by the task force with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined below. Two independent reviewers reviewed and abstracted full-text data for each article, and the 2 sets of data from each reviewer were compared for agreement by a third party. Inconsistencies were re-reviewed and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Citations that considered the audiologic symptom profile of patients with vestibular schwannomas (VSs) were considered. To be included in this guideline, an article had to be a report with key study parameters including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having VS </li>
    <li>Human subjects </li>
    <li>Was not an in vitro study </li>
    <li>Was not a biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014 </li>
    <li>Published in a peer-reviewed journal </li>
    <li>Was not a meeting abstract, editorial, letter, or commentary </li>
    <li>Was published in English </li>
    <li>Quantitatively presented results </li>
</ul>
<p>Additional inclusion criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients diagnosed with a VS either radiographically (i.e., a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or a heavily weighted T2 sequence [i.e., FIESTA sequences] was used for diagnosis of the tumor) or histopathologically (i.e., VS was identified on surgical pathology, regardless of the imaging findings) </li>
    <li>Involved a distinct analysis of VS patients in reviews that included various pathologies of the internal auditory canal (IAC) and cerebellopontine angle (CPA) </li>
    <li>Verified pure tone thresholds and word recognition with formal audiometry </li>
    <li>Included at least 30 patients </li>
</ul>
<p>The authors supplemented searches of electronic databases with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The authors also searched the bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed above. As noted above, the guideline committee also examined lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions. The authors went to great lengths to obtain a complete set of relevant articles to ensure that the guideline is not based on a biased subset of articles. The authors did not include systematic reviews, guidelines, or meta-analyses conducted by others. These documents were developed using different inclusion criteria than those specified in the guideline. Therefore, they may have included studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria. The authors recalled these documents if their abstract suggested that they might address one of the recommendations, and searched their bibliographies for additional studies.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Collection Process</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables for the 3 questions were constructed using key study parameters as previously described. During the development process, the panel participated in a series of conference calls and meetings.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection, Quality Assessment, and Statistical Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections. Reasons for exclusion for papers were also documented to be able to discuss pertinent problem citations in the scientific foundation as needed.</p>
<p>Studies that met the eligibility criteria were subject to more detailed scrutiny and had their data extracted by 1 reviewer and the extracted information was checked by 1 or more other reviewers. Evidence and summary tables, reporting the extracted study information and evidence classification, were generated for all the included studies for each of the questions. Evidence tables were created with the most recent data first and subsequent listings in retrograde chronological order. The table headings consisted of first author name and year, followed by a brief study description, chosen data class, and conclusion. The authors were directed to craft the data in the tables in a succinct and fact-filled manner to allow for rapid understanding of the literature entry by the readership. The literature in the evidence tables was expanded upon in the Results section of each guideline article to emphasize important points supporting its classification and contribution to recommendations. The method by which this was accomplished is expanded upon in the Joint Guideline Committee (JGC) Guideline Development Methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Internal drafts of the tables and manuscripts were developed by sharing them between writers electronically, by telephone, and in face-to-face meetings. Summary and conclusion statements were included for each section, with comments on key issues for future investigation being added where pertinent.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writing Group and Question Establishment</span></strong></p>
<p>The Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) identified vestibular schwannoma (VS) management as a topic worthy of guideline development. Members of the Tumor Section and other neurosurgeons and members of other specialties commonly involved in the management of VSs were identified to form the Vestibular Schwannoma Evidence-Based Practice Guideline Task Force (i.e., the "task force"). The writers were then divided up into topic sections and developed pertinent questions for those topics. These were circulated among the entire task force, modified, and agreed upon. With these questions in hand, the literature searches were executed. Additional details regarding the literature search and review methodology can be found in the Introduction and Methodology Chapter (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). This guideline was then developed using multiple iterations of written review conducted by the authors, then by members of the task force, and finally by AANS/CNS Joint Guideline Committee (JGC).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification System and Recommendation Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The concept of linking evidence to recommendations has been further formalized by the American Medical Association (AMA) and many specialty societies, including AANS, CNS, and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). This formalization involves the designation of specific relationships between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations to avoid ambiguity. Refer to the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables, and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest (COI)</span></strong></p>
<p>The Vestibular Schwannoma Guidelines Task Force members were required to report all possible COIs prior to beginning work on the guideline, using the COI disclosure form of the AANS/CNS Joint Guidelines Committee, including potential COIs that are unrelated to the topic of the guideline. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair reviewed the disclosures and either approved or disapproved the nomination. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair are given latitude to approve nominations of Task Force members with possible conflicts and address this by restricting the writing and reviewing privileges of that person to topics unrelated to the possible COIs. The conflict of interest findings are provided in detail in the companion introduction and methods manuscript (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </p></div>
