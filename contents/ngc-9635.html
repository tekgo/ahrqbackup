Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence <strong>(I-III)</strong> and classification of recommendations <strong>(A-E, L)</strong> are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations."</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Routine universal screening should not be performed for pregnant women at low risk. Serologic screening should be offered only to pregnant women considered to be at risk for primary <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> (<em>T. gondii</em>) infection. <strong>(II-3E)</strong> </li>
    <li>Suspected recent infection in a pregnant woman should be confirmed before intervention by having samples tested at a toxoplasmosis reference laboratory, using tests that are as accurate as possible and correctly interpreted. <strong>(II-2B)</strong> </li>
    <li>If acute infection is suspected, repeat testing should be performed within 2 to 3 weeks, and consideration given to starting therapy with spiramycin immediately, without waiting for the repeat test results. <strong>(II-2B)</strong> </li>
    <li>Amniocentesis should be offered to identify <em>T. gondii</em> in the amniotic fluid by polymerase chain reaction (a) if maternal primary infection is diagnosed, (b) if serologic testing cannot confirm or exclude acute infection, or (c) in the presence of abnormal ultrasound findings (intracranial calcification, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, or severe intrauterine growth restriction). <strong>(II-2B)</strong> </li>
    <li>Amniocentesis should not be offered for the identification of&nbsp;<em>T. gondii</em> infection at less than 18 weeks&rsquo; gestation and should be offered no less than 4 weeks after suspected acute maternal infection to lower the occurrence of false-negative results. <strong>(II-2D)</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Toxoplasmosis in Pregnancy</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li><em>T. gondii</em> infection should be suspected and screening should be offered to pregnant women with ultrasound findings consistent with possible TORCH (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, and other) infection, including but not limited to intracranial calcification, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, or severe intrauterine growth restriction. <strong>(II-2B)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="7">
    <li>Each case involving a pregnant woman suspected of having an acute <em>T. gondii</em> infection acquired during gestation should be discussed with an expert in the management of toxoplasmosis. <strong>(III-B)</strong> </li>
    <li>If maternal infection has been confirmed but the fetus is not yet known to be infected, spiramycin should be offered for fetal prophylaxis (to prevent spread of organisms across the placenta from mother to fetus). <strong>(I-B)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prevention</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="9">
    <li>A combination of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid should be offered as treatment for women in whom fetal infection has been confirmed or is highly suspected (usually by a positive amniotic fluid polymerase chain reaction). <strong>(I-B)</strong> </li>
    <li>Anti-toxoplasma treatment in immunocompetent pregnant women with previous infection with <em>T. gondii</em> should not be necessary. <strong>(I-E)</strong> </li>
    <li>Women who are immunosuppressed or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive should be offered screening because of the risk of reactivation and toxoplasmosis encephalitis. <strong>(I-A)</strong> </li>
    <li>A non-pregnant woman who has been diagnosed with an acute <em>T. gondii</em> infection should be counselled to wait 6 months before attempting to become pregnant. Each case should be considered separately in consultation with an expert. <strong>(III-B)</strong> </li>
    <li>Information on prevention of <em>T. gondii</em> infection in pregnancy should be made available to all women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. <strong>(III-C)</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Quality of Evidence Assessment*</strong></p>

<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from comparisons between times or places with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the results of treatment with penicillin in the 1940s) could also be included in this category</p>
