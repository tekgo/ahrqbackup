Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of admissions for a principal diagnosis of diabetes with long-term complications (renal, eye, neurological, circulatory, or complications not otherwise specified) per 100,000 population, ages 18 years and older.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>People with diabetes are prone to a variety long term complications associated with microvascular disease that may result in hospitalization, as well as long-term disability and death. The most common long-term complications, as targeted by this indicator include: 1) neuropathy, 2) vision disorders, and 3) nephropathy. While these complications are varied, they all have the common source of longstanding poor glycemic control.</p>
<p>Improved access to ambulatory care can improve diabetic management including earlier diabetic case finding. Longstanding improvements in glycemic control and risk factor management can prevent or slow the progression of microvascular disease. This along with earlier complication identification and treatment can decrease or prevent hospitalizations related to these long-term diabetic complications.</p>
<p>There are several nationally accepted clinical guidelines (American Diabetes Association, 2013; Riethof et al., 2012; University of Michigan Health System, 2012; Department of Veteran Affairs &amp; Department of Defense, 2010) that include major recommendations for screening and diagnosis, goals and treatment in the following areas related to long-term complications: nephropathy screening and treatment, retinopathy screening and treatment and neuropathy screening and treatment. These guidelines suggest that long-term complications are preventable and, thus, hospitalizations for these long-term complications are preventable.</p>
<p>This measure is an avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) type indicator. ACSC type indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of potentially avoidable hospitalization if appropriate outpatient care, other healthcare services or community services were accessed and obtained (i.e., measures of the health care system broadly defined). These measures are designed to assess population access to timely, high quality outpatient and public health services in a particular geographic area, for the purpose of managing chronic disease or diagnosing acute illnesses before progressing to inpatient treatment. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), accountable care organizations (ACOs) or public health agencies. ACSC indicators correlate with each other and they may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a national, regional or county level.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>As of 2010, an estimated 25.8 million people in the United States (U.S.) (or 11% of the population) over age 20 had diabetes, of which close to 40% were undiagnosed (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011). Diabetes is the leading cause of cause of new cases of blindness among adults and is the leading cause of both severe and moderate visual loss in working age Americans. Approximately 25% of patients with type 1 diabetes have retinopathy after five years, increasing to 60% and 80% after 10 and 15 years respectively. In 2005 to 2008, 4.3 million people with diabetes aged 40 and older (28.5% of all diabetics) had diabetic retinopathy, and of these, 655,000 (4% of those with diabetes) had an advanced stage (CDC, 2011). Diabetes is also the leading cause of kidney failure, accounting for 44% of all new cases of kidney failure in the U.S. In 2008 alone, 48,374 people with diabetes began treatment for end-stage kidney disease and 202,290 people with diabetes related end-stage kidney disease were living on chronic dialysis or with a kidney transplant (CDC, 2011). About 60% to 70% of people with diabetes have mild to severe forms of neuropathy ranging from peripheral neuropathy (the most common and the precursor to 50% to 75% of all non-traumatic amputations) to the most critical, cardiac autonomic neuropathy and hypoglycemia awareness autonomic failure (both of which may result in sudden death) (CDC, 2011).</p>
<p>Studies performed in the U.S. and abroad have found that improved glycemic control can prevent or lessen the impact of long-term complications in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics (Wang, Lau, &amp; Chalmers, 1993; Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, 1993; United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS], 1995; American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2013). For every percentage point drop in glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c), reduces the risk of micro vascular complications by 40% (CDC, 2011). Blood pressure control reduces the risk of microvascular complications by 33% (CDC, 2011). Detecting and treating diabetic eye disease with laser therapy can reduce the development of severe vision loss by an estimated 50% to 60%. Comprehensive foot care programs (i.e., that include risk assessment, foot-care education and preventive therapy, treatment of foot problems, and referral to specialist) can reduce amputation rates by 45% to 85% (CDC, 2011; Wang, Lau, &amp; Chalmers, 1993). Detecting and treating early diabetic kidney disease by lowering blood pressure can reduce the decline in kidney function by 30% to 70% (MacDonald et al., 2008). In addition to lowering blood pressure, adding an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) reduce proteinuria, a risk factor for developing kidney disease, by about 35% (CDC, 2011). </p>
<p>Despite medical advances and increased awareness of diabetes in both the lay and medical communities, few patients with diabetes broadly achieve targets for glucose management and other preventative care interventions, as outlined in nationally accepted clinical guidelines (ADA, 2013). Access to quality outpatient care has been shown to decrease hospitalizations rates due to diabetes (Ahern &amp; Hendryx, 2007; Chen et al., 2010), all though most studies looked at all-cause hospitalizations (Chen et al., 2010; Cheng, Lee, &amp; Chen, 2012). Higher rates of hospitalization for long-term diabetic complications have been reported in zip codes with higher proportions of hospitalizations with no insurance or Medicaid insurance and with higher hospitalizations rates for hyperglycemic complications (Ward, 2009). A shortage of primary care physicians has been shown to correspond with reduced performance on Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures; whereas living in a state with higher Medicaid reimbursement fees and department of mental health expenses per client were associated both with higher quality on HEDIS measures and lower (better) rates of ambulatory care sensitive hospitalizations (Druss et al., 2012). </p>
<p>A review of 51 studies from the U.S. and the United Kingdom confirmed that ethnic minorities have a higher risk of long-term diabetes complications than whites. Though most of these differences were explained by adjusting for smoking status, socioeconomic status (SES), income, education level, and body mass index (BMI), disparities in processes and outcomes of care remain (Lanting et al., 2005). In addition, Millman et al. (1993) reported that low-income zip codes had four times more diabetes hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and coma per capita than high-income zip codes in 11 states in 1988. </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong><br />
The developer's metric of reliability is the signal to noise ratio, which is the ratio of the between county (area) variance (signal) to the within county (area) variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). There is an area-specific signal to noise ratio, which is used as an empirical Bayes univariate shrinkage estimator. The overall signal to noise ratio is a weighted average of the county (area)-specific signal-to-noise ratio, where the weight is [1 / (signal + noise)^2]. The signal is calculated using an iterative method. The analysis reports the reliability of the risk-adjusted rate (before applying the empirical Bayes univirate shrinkage estimator).</p>
<p>Overall the risk-adjusted rate is highly reliable. Based on a norm of a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.80, 80% of counties (areas) exceed the norm. Reliability is less than the norm in counties (areas) with population less than approximately 3,000 persons, meaning that the performance score is reliability adjusted closer to the shrinkage target in those counties (areas).</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong><br />
The developer conducted construct validity testing to examine the association between the risk-adjusted rate and area structural characteristics potentially associated with quality of care, including prior performance, using regression analysis.</p>
<p>Given the stated rationale, the expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "Less Access to High Quality Outpatient Care" construct validity measure (F1) and the county (area) risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "More Market Competition" construct validity measure (F2) and the county (area) risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The results are consistent with expectations. Also, past performance is a moderate predictor of current performance with a coefficient of 0.74.</p>

The reference population used in the regression is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Data (SID) for the year 2010 (combined), a database consisting of 46 states and approximately 38 million adult discharges, and the United States (U.S.) Census data by county. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., area). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population rate.</p></div>
