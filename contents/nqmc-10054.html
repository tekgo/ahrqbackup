Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the ratio of the actual number of in-hospital deaths in a region or hospital to the number that would have been expected based on the types of patients a region or hospital treats, among the 72 diagnosis groups accounting for about 80% of inpatient mortality. </p></div>
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The hospital standardized mortality ratio (HSMR) is an important measure to improve patient safety and quality of care in Canadian hospitals.</p>
<p>The HSMR adjusts for factors that affect in-hospital mortality rates, such as patient age, sex, length of stay, admission status, comorbidity group and transfers. It then compares the actual number of deaths in a hospital with the average Canadian experience. The ratio provides a starting point to assess mortality rates and identify areas for improvement to help reduce hospital deaths.</p>
<p>The HSMR was developed in the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s and has been used by several countries. When tracked over time, the ratio can be a motivator for change. The HSMR indicates how successful hospitals and health regions have been in reducing inpatient deaths&mdash;leading to improved patient care. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) has led the effort in calculating HSMRs for Canada and publishes results for eligible facilities and regions in all provinces. </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In 2009 to 2010, 72 diagnosis groups accounted for about 80% of deaths among patients who did not receive palliative care. The top causes of deaths in Canadian hospitals were: stroke, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, sepsis and heart attack (acute myocardial infarction). Trends in mortality rates vary by patient group. For example, death rates for patients with heart attacks fell faster than those for patients with pneumonia over the study period. In contrast, mortality rates stayed constant or rose for other patient groups, such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and sepsis. </li>
    <li>In Canada, standardized in-hospital death rates have fallen over the last three years. However, results vary by patient group. For example, death rates for patients with heart attacks fell faster than those for patients with pneumonia. Trends also vary across the country. Refer to <em>HSMR: A New Approach for Measuring Hospital Mortality Trends in Canada</em> in the "Companion Documents" field for hospital standardized mortality ratio (HSMR) trends by health region and hospital. </li>
