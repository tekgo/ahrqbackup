Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For staging please refer to the Appendix in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The following recommendations have been adapted from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Melanoma Guidelines (2009), with modifications based on guidance from other guideline organizations (e.g., the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, 1999; the European Society for Medical Oncology, 2009; and the German Cancer Society and German Dermatologic Society, 2008) as well as evidence from clinical trials.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Treatment</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Sentinel node biopsy in patients undergoing curative resection of a solitary in-transit metastasis </li>
    <li>Complete surgical excision to clear margins is preferred, if feasible, especially for patients with a 1 or a small number of in-transit metastases </li>
    <li>The following options may be considered for patients with more extensive metastases:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Enrolment in a clinical trial </li>
        <li>Isolated limb infusion with melphalan and/or other cytotoxic agents (e.g., actinomycin-D) </li>
        <li>Hyperthermic limb perfusion with melphalan </li>
        <li>Intralesional local injection (e.g., bacillus Calmette Guerin [BCG], interferon [IFN]) or topical imiquimod can be considered if the patient has a limited number of in-transit metastases, particularly dermal lesions, which are not amenable to complete surgical excision </li>
        <li>Local ablation therapy </li>
        <li>Radiation therapy
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Treatment to tumour bed, regions of in-transit disease and nodal drainage basin can be considered based on the pathology after resection and other patient and disease factors. </li>
            <li>Electron beams with quantum energy of 6&ndash;8 MeV with bolus are appropriate for smaller volume superficial treatment; more complex photon beam arrangements may be needed depending on the clinical target volume. </li>
            <li>Postoperative radiation therapy should be considered after excision of recurrent in-transit metastases. </li>
            <li>If primary surgery to obtain clear margins is not possible, primary radiotherapy (RT) may be considered. </li>
            <li>Hypofractionated treatment (e.g., 32 Gy in 4 fractions or 30&ndash;36 Gy in 6 fractions over 3 weeks) may be relevant in some situations of in-transit disease. Hypofractionation is more convenient for patients, but has potential for greater chronic toxicity.
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Standard treatment (50&ndash;60 Gy) and observation have not been compared in randomized studies for in-transit disease, and thus efficacy of radiation in improving local control (e.g., 5-year axillary control rate of 88% with post-operative RT to 30&ndash;36 Gy in 5&ndash;6 fractions [Beadle et al., 2009]; complete response rate of 24% with RT to 50 Gy in 20 fractions and 32 Gy in 4 fractions [Sause et al., 1985]) must be extrapolated from case series in other situations. </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Systemic therapy (particularly after failure of local and/or regional therapy). The following options can be considered as first- or second-line therapy:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Clinical trial (preferred) </li>
            <li>Dacarbazine </li>
            <li>Temozolomide (currently available only if patient has private insurance or is willing to pay, or has special approval) </li>
            <li>High-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2; only in very select patients) </li>
            <li>Dacarbazine- or temozolomide-based combination chemotherapy/biochemotherapy (including cisplatin and vinblastine with or without IL-2 or IFN-alpha) </li>
            <li>Paclitaxel alone or in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Adjuvant Treatment</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
    <li>If the patient is disease-free, the following options for adjuvant therapy can be considered:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Clinical trial </li>
        <li>IFN-alpha </li>
        <li>Observation </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In-transit Recurrence</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>A surgically resectable recurrence should be re-excised with negative margins. </li>
    <li>Sentinel node biopsy may be considered. </li>
    <li>Unresectable recurrence could be treated with any 1 of the following options:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Hyperthermic limb perfusion or infusion </li>
        <li>Intralesional injections with BCG or IFN-alpha </li>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (Patient or Population, Intervention, Comparisons, Outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Question</strong></p>
<p>What are the best treatment and management options for improving the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with melanoma with in-transit disease of the limbs?</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE, Cochrane, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Abstracts and proceedings, and CANCERLIT databases were searched (1985 through November 2009) for clinical trials. Search terms included: "primary cutaneous melanoma" or "regional metastatic disease" or "in-transit disease" or "intradermal nodules" or "subcutaneous nodules" AND "isolated limb perfusion" or "isolated limb infusion" or "hyperthermic limb perfusion" or "tumor necrosis factor alpha" or "melphalan" or "radiation therapy" or "tamoxifen" or "cryotherapy" or "laser therapy" or "bacillus calmette guerin" or "interferon" or "chemotherapy." A total of 585 clinical trials (limits: human and English language) were returned, from which 35 documents were selected. In addition, the National Guideline Clearinghouse and individual guideline organizations were searched for practice guidelines relevant to this topic.</p>
<p>For the 2013 update of the guideline, PubMed was searched for evidence on in-transit melanoma. The search term "melanoma" was used and results were limited to clinical trials, published between December 2009 and January 2013. Citations were hand-searched for studies pertaining to in-transit disease, resulting in three relevant studies.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>Following a review of the evidence by the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team, no major changes to the recommendations were made.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
