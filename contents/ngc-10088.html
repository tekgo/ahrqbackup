Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Levels of evidence (<strong>I&ndash;V</strong>) and grades of recommendation (<strong>A&ndash;F</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pathoanatomical Features</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should assess for impairments in the capsuloligamentous complex and musculotendinous structures surrounding the shoulder complex when a patient presents with shoulder pain and mobility deficits (adhesive capsulitis). The loss of passive motion in multiple planes, particularly external rotation with the arm at the side and in varying degrees of shoulder abduction, is a significant finding that can be used to guide treatment planning. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation E)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk Factors</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should recognize that (1) patients with diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease are at risk for developing adhesive capsulitis, and (2) adhesive capsulitis is more prevalent in individuals who are 40 to 65 years of age, female, and have had a previous episode of adhesive capsulitis in the contralateral arm. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation C)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Course</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should recognize that adhesive capsulitis occurs as a continuum of pathology characterized by a staged progression of pain and mobility deficits and that, at 12 to 18 months, mild to moderate mobility deficits and pain may persist, though many patients report minimal to no disability. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation B)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis/Classification</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should recognize that patients with adhesive capsulitis present with a gradual and progressive onset of pain and loss of active and passive shoulder motion in both elevation and rotation. Utilizing the evaluation and intervention components described in these guidelines will assist clinicians in medical screening, differential evaluation of common shoulder musculoskeletal disorders, diagnosing tissue irritability levels, and planning intervention strategies for patients with shoulder pain and mobility deficits. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation F)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Differential Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications other than adhesive capsulitis when the patient's reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with the diagnosis/classification section of these guidelines, or when the patient's symptoms are not resolving with interventions aimed at normalization of the patient's impairments of body function. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation F)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examination</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use validated functional outcome measures, such as the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder scale (ASES), or the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). These should be utilized before and after interventions intended to alleviate the impairments of body function and structure, activity limitations, and participation restrictions associated with adhesive capsulitis. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Activity Limitation and Participation Restriction Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should utilize easily reproducible activity limitation and participation restriction measures associated with their patient's shoulder pain to assess the changes in the patient's level of shoulder function over the episode of care. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation F)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Physical Impairment Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should measure pain, active shoulder range of motion (ROM), and passive shoulder ROM to assess the key impairments of body function and body structures in patients with adhesive capsulitis. Glenohumeral joint accessory motion may be assessed to determine translational glide loss. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation E)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interventions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Corticosteroid Injections</strong></p>
<p>Intra-articular corticosteroid injections combined with shoulder mobility and stretching exercises are more effective in providing short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief and improved function compared to shoulder mobility and stretching exercises alone. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Education</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should utilize patient education that (1) describes the natural course of the disease, (2) promotes activity modification to encourage functional, pain-free ROM, and (3) matches the intensity of stretching to the patient's current level of irritability. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Modalities</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may utilize shortwave diathermy, ultrasound, or electrical stimulation combined with mobility and stretching exercises to reduce pain and improve shoulder ROM in patients with adhesive capsulitis. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation C)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joint Mobilization</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may utilize joint mobilization procedures primarily directed to the glenohumeral joint to reduce pain and increase motion and function in patients with adhesive capsulitis. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation C)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Translational Manipulation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may utilize translational manipulation under anesthesia directed to the glenohumeral joint in patients with adhesive capsulitis who are not responding to conservative interventions. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation C)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stretching Exercises</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should instruct patients with adhesive capsulitis in stretching exercises. The intensity of the exercises should be determined by the patient's tissue irritability level. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation B)</strong></p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>It was acknowledged by the Orthopaedic Section, American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) content experts that only performing a systematic search and review of the evidence related to diagnostic categories based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) terminology would not be sufficient for these International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF)-based clinical practice guidelines, as most of the evidence associated with changes in levels of impairment or function in homogeneous populations is not readily searchable using the ICD terminology.</p>
<p>Thus, the authors of these guidelines independently performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1966 through September 2011) for any relevant articles related to classification, examination, and intervention for musculoskeletal conditions related to classification, outcome measures, and intervention strategies for shoulder adhesive capsulitis and frozen shoulder. Additionally, when relevant articles were identified, their reference lists were hand searched in an attempt to identify other relevant articles.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>These guidelines are not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of medical care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made in light of the clinical data presented by the patient; the diagnostic and treatment options available; and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences. However, it is suggested that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in the patient's medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.</p></div>
