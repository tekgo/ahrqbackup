<p>The literature from August 1, 2011 (the end of the previous panel's search) to July 1, 2014, was searched to identify published systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies that were relevant to the project. The initial literature search was conducted on PubMed and the Cochrane Library. The drugs, drug classes, and conditions included in the 2012 criteria were used as initial search terms and were generally focused on "adverse drug events" and "adverse drug reactions." Individual drugs, drug classes, and conditions were searched individually and in combination. Search filters included human subjects, English language, and aged 65 and older. Case reports, case series, editorials, and letters were excluded. Clinical reviews were included for initial screening as potential background information and for reference list review. The initial searches identified 20,748 citations, of which 6,719 were selected for preliminary abstract review. The panel co-chairs reviewed 3,387 citations and abstracts, of which 2,199 were excluded for not meeting the study purpose or not containing primary data. At the time of the panel's face-to-face meeting, the co-chairs had selected 1,188 unduplicated citations for the full panel review. Subsequent searches (defined by panel workgroups) were conducted until December 15, 2014; some of these searches included studies published in the prior 10 years. The American Geriatric Society (AGS) also gave its members and members of the public a chance to submit evidence they felt the panel should consider. Any evidence submitted had to be evidence based and published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>An independent researcher led the effort to prepare evidence tables and relied on the assistance of one other researcher for the initial drafts of evidence tables. The evidence tables included a summary of the study, as well as a quality rating and rating of the risk of bias for selected articles. The quality rating system was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias and Jadad scoring system. The ratings were based on six critical elements: evidence of balanced allocation, allocation concealment, blinded outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Following the Cochrane approach, each article was assigned a quality score (1&ndash;6 points) and a risk-of-bias rating. Low risk of bias was indicated by a low risk of bias in all six domains, unclear risk of bias was indicated by an unclear rating on one or more domains (others low) or a high risk of bias on one domain (others low or unclear), and high risk of bias was indicated by a high risk of bias on two or more domains. The independent researcher reviewed all evidence tables and proposed quality and risk-of-bias ratings before they were distributed to the expert panel to use for the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) rating process.</p></div>

<p>For this new update, the American Geriatric Society (AGS) employed a well-tested framework that has long been used for development of clinical practice guidelines. Specifically, the framework involved the appointment of a 13-member interdisciplinary expert panel with relevant clinical expertise and experience and an understanding of how the criteria have been previously used. This framework also involved a development process using a modified Delphi method that included a systematic literature review and evaluation of the evidence base by the expert panel. Finally, the Institute of Medicine's 2011 report on developing practice guidelines, which included a period for public comments, guided the framework.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>A panel with expertise in geriatric medicine, nursing, pharmacy practice, research, and quality measures was convened comprising members of the previous panel and new members. Other factors that influenced selection of panel members were the desire to have interdisciplinary representation, a range of medical expertise, and representation from different practice settings (e.g., long-term care, ambulatory care, geriatric mental health, palliative care and hospice). In addition to the 13-member panel, representatives from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, National Committee for Quality Assurance, and Pharmacy Quality Alliance were invited to serve as ex-officio members.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>Since the previous update, the AGS had created a group to monitor the literature and to advise the 2015 expert panel of any articles relevant to the 2012 criteria and respond accordingly. Two members of the expert panel led this group, which was composed of members of the AGS Clinical Practice Committee and other expert members of AGS. The 2015 expert panel convened for a 2-day in-person meeting on July 28&ndash;29, 2014, to review the groups' findings and the results of the literature search. Panel discussions were used to define terms and to address questions of consistency, inclusion of infrequently used drugs, strategies for evaluating the evidence, consolidation or expansion of individual criterion, and development of renal dosage and drug&ndash;drug interaction tables. The panel then split into four groups, with each assigned a specific set of criteria for evaluation. Groups were assigned as closely as possible according to specific area of clinical expertise (e.g., cardiovascular, central nervous system). Groups reviewed the literature search, selected citations relevant to their assigned criteria, and determined which citations they wanted to see the full-text article for and which should be abstracted into an evidence table. The groups then presented their findings to the full panel for comment and consensus. After the meeting, each group participated in a series of conference calls to continue the literature selection process and resolve any questions.</p>
<p>Each panelist independently rated the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation for each criterion using the American College of Physicians' Guideline Grading System (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field), which is based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) scheme developed previously. AGS staff compiled the panelist ratings for each group and returned them to that group, which then reached consensus in a conference call. Additional literature was obtained and included as needed. When group consensus could not be reached, the full panel reviewed the ratings and worked through any differences until consensus was reached. The panel judged each criterion as being a strong or weak recommendation on the basis of the quality of supporting evidence, the frequency and severity of harms, and the availability of better treatment alternatives. For some criteria, the panel provided a "strong" recommendation, even though the quality of evidence was low or moderate, when the potential for harm was substantial and safer or more-effective alternatives were available.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The goal of the 2015 American Geriatric Society (AGS) Beers Criteria continues to be improving the care of older adults by reducing their exposure to potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). This is accomplished by using the criteria as an educational tool and quality measure&mdash;two uses that are not always in agreement. These criteria are not meant to be applied in a punitive manner. Prescribing decisions are not always clear-cut, and clinicians must consider multiple factors, including discontinuation of medications no longer indicated. Quality measures must be clearly defined, easily applied, and measured with limited information and thus, although useful, cannot perfectly distinguish appropriate from inappropriate care. The panel considered and vigorously discussed both roles during deliberations. The panel's review of evidence at times identified subgroups of individuals who should be exempt from a given criterion or to whom a specific criterion should apply. Such a criterion may not be easily applied as a quality measure, particularly when such subgroups cannot be easily identified through structured and readily accessible electronic health data. In these cases, the panel felt that a criterion should not be expanded to include all adults aged 65 and older when only certain subgroups have an adverse balance of benefits versus harms for the medication or conversely may be appropriate candidates for a medication that is otherwise problematic. </li>
    <li>Despite past and current efforts to translate the criteria into practice, some controversy and myths about their use in practice and policy continue to prevail. The panel addressed these concerns and myths by writing a companion piece to the updated criteria to address the best way for patients, providers, and health systems to use (and not use) the 2015 AGS Beers Criteria. Alternative suggestions to medications included in the current Use of High-Risk Medications in the Elderly and Potentially Harmful Drug-Disease Interactions in the Elderly quality measures are presented in another companion paper (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </li>
    <li>The 2015 AGS Beers Criteria have several important limitations. Older adults are often underrepresented in drug trials. Thus, using an evidence-based approach may underestimate some drug-related problems or lead to weaker evidence grading. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used for evidence grading, which allowed for rigor and greater transparency in the evidence grading process. The criteria cannot account for all individuals and special populations; for instance, they do not comprehensively address the needs of individuals receiving palliative and hospice care, in whom the balance of benefits and harms for many drugs on the list may differ from those of the general population of older adults. Finally, the search strategies used might have missed some studies published in languages other than English and studies available in unpublished technical reports, white papers, or other "gray literature" sources. </li>
    <li>The decisions and content of the 2015 AGS Beers Criteria are those of the AGS and the panel members and are not necessarily those of the U.S. government or U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. </li>
