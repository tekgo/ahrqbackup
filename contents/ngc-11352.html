Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the classification of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>1-3</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>Please see the full-text version of this guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for the target population of each recommendation listed below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stereotactic Radiosurgery</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the overall probability of maintaining serviceable hearing following stereotactic radiosurgery utilizing modern dose planning, at 2, 5, and 10 yr following treatment?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Individuals who meet these criteria and are considering stereotactic radiosurgery should be counseled that there is moderately high probability (&gt;50%- 75%) of hearing preservation at 2 yr, moderately high probability (&gt;50%-75%) of hearing preservation at 5 yr, and moderately low probability (&gt;25%-50%) of hearing preservation at 10 yr.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Among patients with AAO-HNS (American Academy of Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery hearing classification) class A or GR (Gardner-Robertson hearing classification) grade I hearing at baseline, what is the overall probability of maintaining serviceable hearing following stereotactic radiosurgery, utilizing modern dose planning, at 2, 5, and 10 yr following treatment?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Individuals who meet these criteria and are considering stereotactic radiosurgery should be counseled that there is a high probability (&gt;75%-100%) of hearing preservation at 2 yr, moderately high probability (&gt;50%-75%) of hearing preservation at 5 yr, and moderately low probability (&gt;25%-50%) of hearing preservation at 10 yr.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>What patient- and tumor-related factors influence progression to nonserviceable hearing following stereotactic radiosurgery using &le;13 Gy to the tumor margin?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Individuals who meet these criteria and are considering stereotactic radiosurgery should be counseled regarding the probability of successful hearing preservation based on the following prognostic data: the most consistent prognostic features associated with maintenance of serviceable hearing are good preoperative word recognition and/or pure tone thresholds with variable cut-points reported, smaller tumor size, marginal tumor dose &le;12 Gy, and cochlear dose &le;4 Gy. Age and sex are not strong predictors of hearing preservation outcome.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Microsurgery</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the overall probability of maintaining serviceable hearing following microsurgical resection of small to medium-sized sporadic vestibular schwannomas early after surgery, at 2, 5, and 10 yr following treatment?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Individuals who meet these criteria and are considering microsurgical resection should be counseled that there is a moderately low probability (&gt;25%- 50%) of hearing preservation immediately following surgery, moderately low probability (&gt;25%-50%) of hearing preservation at 2 yr, moderately low probability (&gt;25%-50%) of hearing preservation at 5 yr, and moderately low probability (&gt;25%-50%) of hearing preservation at 10 yr.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p>Among patients with AAO-HNS class A or GR grade I hearing at baseline, what is the overall probability of maintaining serviceable hearing following microsurgical resection of small to medium-sized sporadic vestibular schwannomas early after surgery, at 2, 5, and 10 yr following treatment?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Individuals who meet these criteria and are considering microsurgical resection should be counseled that there is a moderately high probability (&gt;50%- 75%) of hearing preservation immediately following surgery, moderately high probability (&gt;50%-75%) of hearing preservation at 2 yr, moderately high probability (&gt;50%-75%) of hearing preservation at 5 yr, and moderately low probability (&gt;25%-50%) of hearing preservation at 10 yr.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p>What patient- and tumor-related factors influence progression to nonserviceable hearing following microsurgical resection of small to medium-sized sporadic vestibular schwannomas?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Individuals who meet these criteria and are considering microsurgical resection should be counseled regarding the probability of successful hearing preservation based on the following prognostic data: the most consistent prognostic features associated with maintenance of serviceable hearing are good preoperative word recognition and/or pure tone thresholds with variable cut-points reported, smaller tumor size commonly less than 1 cm, and presence of a distal internal auditory canal cerebrospinal fluid fundal cap. Age and sex are not strong predictors of hearing preservation outcome.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conservative Observation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 7</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the overall probability of maintaining serviceable hearing with conservative observation of vestibular schwannomas at 2, 5, and 10 yr following diagnosis?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Individuals who meet these criteria and are considering observation should be counseled that there is a high probability (&gt;75%-100%) of hearing preservation at 2 yr, moderately high probability (&gt;50%-75%) of hearing preservation at 5 yr, and moderately low probability (&gt;25%-50%) of hearing preservation at 10 yr.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 8</span></strong></p>
<p>Among patients with AAO-HNS class A or GR grade I hearing at baseline, what is the overall probability of maintaining serviceable hearing with conservative observation at 2 and 5 yr following diagnosis?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Individuals who meet these criteria and are considering stereotactic radiosurgery should be counseled that there is a high probability (&gt;75%-100%) of hearing preservation at 2 yr, and moderately high probability (&gt;50%-75%) of hearing preservation at 5 yr. Insufficient data were available to determine the probability of hearing preservation at 10 yr for this population subset.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 9</span></strong></p>
<p>What patient and tumor-related factors influence progression to nonserviceable hearing during conservative observation?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Individuals who meet these criteria and are considering observation should be counseled regarding probability of successful hearing preservation based on the following prognostic data: the most consistent prognostic features associated with maintenance of serviceable hearing are good preoperative word recognition and/or pure tone thresholds with variable cut-points reported, as well as nongrowth of the tumor. Tumor size at the time of diagnosis, age, and sex do not predict future development of nonserviceable hearing during observation.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Process Overview</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence-based clinical practice guideline task force members and the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the management of vestibular schwannomas (VSs). Additional details of the systematic review are provided below and within the introduction and methodology chapter of the guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>One thousand three hundred and seven citations were manually reviewed by the team with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined below. Three independent reviewers reviewed and abstracted full-text data for each article, and the 2 sets of data were compared for agreement by a third party. Inconsistencies were re-reviewed, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. To be included in this guideline, an article has to be a study that:</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having VSs </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Was not an in vitro study </li>
    <li>Was not a biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Was published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014 </li>
    <li>Was published in a peer-reviewed journal </li>
    <li>Was not a meeting abstract, editorial, letter, or a commentary </li>
    <li>Was published in English </li>
    <li>Included quantitatively presented results </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Used the 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) or Gardner&ndash;Robertson (GR) hearing classification system or presented data using a cut-off of &ge;50% word recognition score and &le;50 dB pure tone average for defining serviceable hearing or had individual patient data presented such that the latter criteria could be applied and analyzed </li>
    <li>For patients receiving single fraction radiation therapy, a contemporary dose plan using &le;13 Gy to the tumor margin </li>
    <li>Included a median or mean follow-up of at least 2 years following treatment </li>
    <li>Included a minimum of 20 patients </li>
    <li>Studies focusing on NF2 or those reporting outcomes in sporadic and NF2-associated tumors, without providing separate outcome data, were not included for review </li>
</ul>
<p>The authors did not include systematic reviews, guidelines, or meta-analyses conducted by other authors. These documents were developed using different inclusion criteria than those specified in this guideline. Therefore, they may have included studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria stated above. The authors recalled these documents if their abstracts suggested that they might address one of the recommendations presented here, and the bibliographies were searched for additional studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014. Three electronic databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline task force members and the medical librarian using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies (see Table 1 and Figure 1 in the full guideline [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p>The authors supplemented searches of electronic databases with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The authors also searched the bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed above. As noted above, the guideline committee also examined lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions. The authors went to great lengths to obtain a complete set of relevant articles. Having a complete set ensures that the guideline is not based on a biased subset of articles.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables for radiation treatment, microsurgery, and observation were constructed using key study parameters as outlined in the Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence" field. In addition, the percentage of patients who maintained useful hearing at time points between 1 and 10 years and who had serviceable hearing at baseline was recorded according to data available in each study. "Serviceable hearing" or "useful hearing" was defined by a word recognition score of &ge;50% and a pure tone average or speech response threshold of &le;50 dB HL, which is equivalent to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) class A-B and Gardner&ndash;Robertson (GR) grade I-II. The aggregate data obtained from individual studies were summarized via a weighted average to determine the overall percentage of patients with useful hearing at years 1 through 10 for each treatment modality. To accommodate a range of outcomes between studies, 4 ordinal categories of probability were devised for the purpose of guideline formulation: "high probability" of hearing preservation defined by &gt;75% to 100%, "moderately high probability" defined by &gt;50% to 75%, "moderately low probability" defined by &gt;25% to 50%, and "low probability" defined by 0% to 25%.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification of Evidence and Guideline Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The concept of linking evidence to recommendations has been further formalized by the American Medical Association and many specialty societies, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), and the American Academy of Neurology. This formalization involves the designation of specific relationships between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations to avoid ambiguity. In the paradigm for prognostication used in this guideline, evidence is classified into 1 of 3 tiers based upon the degree at which the study fulfills 5 technical criteria as outlined in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field.</p>
<p>A basis for these guidelines can be viewed in Haines SJ and Nicholas JS (2006). Evidence-Based Medicine: A Conceptual Framework. In Haines SJ and Walters BC (Eds.), <em>Evidence-Based Neurosurgery: An Introduction</em> (Pages 1-17). New York: Thieme Medical Publishers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables, and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The Vestibular Schwannoma Guidelines Task Force members were required to report all possible COIs prior to beginning work on the guideline, using the COI disclosure form of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Guidelines Committee, including potential COIs that are unrelated to the topic of the guideline. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair reviewed the disclosures and either approved or disapproved the nomination. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair are given latitude to approve nominations of Task Force members with possible conflicts and address this by restricting the writing and reviewing privileges of that person to topics unrelated to the possible COIs. The conflict of interest findings are provided in detail in the full-text introduction and methods manuscript (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>
