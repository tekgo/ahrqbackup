<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure addresses pain for patients with high severity of illness and risk of death, including seriously and incurably ill patients enrolled in hospice or hospital-based palliative care. Research on care of patients with serious incurable illness and those nearing the end of life shows they experience high rates of pain (40% to 70% prevalence) and other physical, emotional, and spiritual causes of distress ("A controlled trial," 1995; Gade et al., 2008). The National Priorities Partnership has identified palliative and end-of-life care as one of its national priorities. A goal of this priority is to ensure that all patients with life-limiting illness have access to effective treatment for symptoms such as pain and shortness of breath. The affected populations are large; in 2009, 1.56 million people with life-limiting illness received hospice care ("NHPCO facts and figures," 2010). In 2008, 58.5% of United States (U.S.) hospitals with 50 or more beds had some form of palliative care service, and national trends show steady expansion of these services ("Palliative care programs," 2010). Patients and family caregivers rate pain management as a high priority when living with serious and life-limiting illnesses (Singer, Martin, &amp; Kelner, 1999). The consequences of inadequate screening, assessment and treatment for pain include physical suffering, functional limitation, and development of apathy and depression (Gordon et al., 2007).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Pain is prevalent and undertreated for many populations of seriously ill patients, including those patients nearing the end of life. Poor screening, assessment, and undertreatment of pain is more common for patients with serious illness who are also of minority race ethnicity. Use of the Pain Screening and Pain Assessment quality measures will increase reporting and efforts to improve awareness of the presence of pain (screening) and assessment of severity, etiology and effect on function (assessment) which are the essential first steps required for quality pain management and treatment.</p>
<p>Pain is prevalent, underdiagnosed and undertreated in cancer and other life-limiting or serious illnesses. The prevalence of pain ranges from 40% to 80% in seriously ill patient populations. As detailed in a systematic review from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the American Pain Society Quality of Care guidelines, pain screening and assessment are the essential steps required to ensure that pain is detected by clinicians and appropriate treatment implemented (Wells, Pasero, &amp; McCaffery, 2008; Gordon et al., 2005). Failure to screen, assess, and treat pain results in functional limitations, physiologic stress, and psychological harms such as social withdrawal and depression. </p>
<p>The current quality of pain screening, assessment, and treatment is poor, as documented in systematic pain prevalence and treatment studies from hospital, outpatient, cancer and nursing home settings (Reynolds et al., 2002; Deandrea et al. 2008; Mularski et al., 2006; Erdek &amp; Pronovost, 2004). In a systematic review of quality of pain care for diverse patient populations, Gordon reported high average pain severity (6.17 to 8.37 on 10-point scale) and moderate rates of pain severity screening or other assessment (47% to 96%). These findings did not vary by underlying diagnosis (Gordon et al., 2002).</p>
<p>Extensive evidence documents disparities in cancer pain treatment and control (Pletcher et al., 2008; Green, Montague, &amp; Hart-Johnson, 2009). Nursing home residents with advanced cancer receive less effective pain treatment if they are African American (Bernabei et al., 1998; Engle, Fox-Hill, &amp; Graney, 1998). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Minority Outpatient Pain Study enrolled 1308 patients with advanced cancer. After clinic visits, physicians underestimated pain severity for 64% of Hispanic and 74% of African American patients (Anderson et al., 2000). Among patients with pain, 65% of Hispanic and African American patients received inadequate treatment relative to practice guidelines, as did 50% of white patients (Cleeland et al., 1997; Cleeland et al., 1994).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Two research nurse abstractors independently recorded quality measures data on a random subset of 20 seriously ill patients. Abstractors used the pre-defined operational definitions and a structured chart abstraction tool to record numerator and denominator data separately. Patients were a subsample of 460 seriously ill patients without specialty palliative care admitted to an acute care hospital for at least 1 day to four inpatient services. Records eligible for sampling included all seriously ill adult patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care, medically complex patients aged 65 and older admitted to an acute care of the elderly unit, and medical oncology patients with Stage IV carcinoma. </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Inter-rater reliability between the two abstractors was assessed using kappa statistics. </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. The nurse abstractors achieved excellent inter-rater reliability for this measure with Kappa=0.94. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Hospice: The total patient sample size was 126. Fourteen hospices, located in seven different states, representing both free-standing and hospital based providers were recruited to participate. Each hospice was asked to contribute data from nine patient records to the study. Nine hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine discharges; five hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine admissions. </p>
<p>Palliative Care: The total patient sample size was 562. Chart abstractions were completed for 102 consecutive seriously ill patients with specialty palliative care consultation, and a random sample of 460 seriously ill patients without specialty palliative care admitted to an acute care hospital for at least 1 day to four inpatient services with high proportions of seriously ill patients. Records eligible for sampling included all patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care, medically complex patients aged 65 and older admitted to a geriatric evaluation unit, and medical oncology patients with Stage IV carcinoma. Because palliative care domains become even more relevant closer to death, patients dying in hospital were oversampled to ensure a final ratio of 1 decedent to 1 live discharge. Consistent with oversampling of decedent records, 55% of these patients died in hospital. The age of the patients ranged from 16 to 99 years, with the mean age 61. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (65%), with smaller subgroups who were African American (24%) and Hispanic/Latino (4%). The most common life-limiting diagnoses were infections (37%), cancer (34%), pulmonary (29%), and neurologic diseases (21%). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Hospice sample: Face validity was tested using formal expert panel review. The PEACE project team convened a 14-member technical expert panel (TEP) of nationally recognized experts with extensive experience in the following areas: medical or nursing expertise in hospice and palliative care, methods and instrumentation, and quality improvement. Using criteria provided by the Carolinas Center for Medical Excellence (CCME) study team, TEP members rated each potential quality measure from 1 (low) to 5 (high) on four criteria: importance, scientific soundness, feasibility and usability. The rating criteria mirrored those used by the National Quality Forum and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Measures Management System. To identify the measures with the most favorable ratings, a summary measure was created. For each quality measure, the average TEP rating for each criterion was calculated and then an overall average measure rating (AMR) was tabulated, weighting each the criteria equally. </p>
<p>Palliative Care sample: Face validity of PEACE quality measures for hospital-based specialty palliative care was addressed using stakeholder review and feedback. Investigators prepared data reports in a summary format with detailed operational definitions, and led a 1-hour discussion with nursing and physician leaders from each service group &ndash; medical intensive care unit (MICU), surgical intensive care unit (SICU), acute care for the elderly (geriatrics), oncology, and palliative care. The discussion included feedback of quality measure data, response to questions and critiques, and eliciting stakeholder feedback about the validity and actionability of this data for the care of their patients. Stakeholders were specifically asked to comment on the accuracy of the data as a reflection of current care practices, and their highest priority area for future quality improvement. </p>
<p>Construct validity was tested by comparing the PEACE quality measures for patients seen by specialty interdisciplinary palliative care consultants to those not receiving specialty palliative care services.</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. Hospice sample: Completed ratings were received from 13 of the 14 TEP members. The 75th percentile cut-point translated into an AMR=3.73 (on a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 is highest). This process resulted in the identification of 23 measures with the highest TEP ratings for importance, scientific soundness, feasibility and usability. Clinical assessment of pain had an overall rating of 4.15 while screening for pain was added as an antecedent measure. Pilot testing in the hospice sample revealed that only 78% of 126 hospice patients were screened for pain, and 60% of those who screened positive were given a comprehensive clinical assessment of their pain. </p>
<p>Palliative Care sample: Face Validity: Stakeholder discussions provided broad endorsement of face validity, with some considerations for specific patient populations. Intensive care and geriatrics clinicians endorsed the primary importance of pain screening and assessment, but expressed doubts about the validity of numerical pain severity ratings when used for nonverbal or confused patients. Medical oncologists endorsed the face validity of these quality measures, but favored quality measures endorsed by oncology professional organizations. </p>
<p>Construct Validity: Screening for pain with a numerical pain scale was nearly universal for all seriously ill patients, regardless of use of specialty palliative care, and half had moderate or severe pain. Patients with moderate or severe pain were more likely to have a clinical assessment of pain if seen by specialty palliative care (67% vs 42%, p=0.002). </p>
<p><strong>Identification of Meaningful Differences in Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Hospice: The total patient sample size was 126. Fourteen hospices, located in seven different states, representing both free-standing and hospital based providers, were recruited to participate. Each hospice was asked to contribute data from nine patient records to the study. Nine hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine discharges; five hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine admissions.</p>
<p>A common structured data collection tool was developed for use by all hospices, regardless of whether the patient record was an admission or discharge record. Instructions embedded in the tool indicated the data items appropriate to each type of record. Hospices were instructed not to institute new data collection procedures for the data collection pilot. If a data item could not be found, they were told to mark the item as "unable to determine." </p>
<p>A data dictionary containing item-specific instructions and notes related to the patient data collection tool was distributed to each hospice center. Technical assistance was provided by email and phone to staff during the data collection period. Questions, and responses, that arose during data collection were immediately distributed to all hospices participating in the data pilot.</p>
<p>Palliative Care: The total patient sample size was 562. Chart abstractions were completed for 102 consecutive seriously ill patients with specialty palliative care consultation, and a random sample of 460 seriously ill patients without specialty palliative care admitted to an acute care hospital for at least 1 day to four inpatient services with high proportions of seriously ill patients. Records eligible for sampling included all patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care, medically complex patients aged 65 and older admitted to a geriatric evaluation unit, and medical oncology patients with Stage IV carcinoma. Because palliative care domains become even more relevant closer to death, patients dying in hospital were oversampled to ensure a final ratio of 1 decedent to 1 live discharge. Consistent with oversampling of decedent records, 55% of these patients died in hospital. The age of the patients ranged from 16 to 99 years, with the mean age 61. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (65%), with smaller subgroups who were African American (24%) and Hispanic/Latino (4%). The most common life-limiting diagnoses were infections (37%), cancer (34%), pulmonary (29%), and neurologic diseases (21%). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Construct validity was tested by comparing the PEACE quality measures for patients seen by specialty interdisciplinary palliative care consultants to those not receiving specialty palliative care services. Percentage of patients with and without specialty palliative care for whom the quality measure was met was compared for difference using the chi-square statistic. </p>
<p><em>Results</em>. Hospice sample: 60% of patients who screened positive for pain on the admission evaluation had a comprehensive pain assessment within 24 hours. </p>
<p>Palliative Care sample: Patients with moderate or severe pain were more likely to have a documented clinical assessment of pain if seen by specialty palliative care (67% vs 42%, p=0.002).</p></div>

Patients enrolled in hospice OR receiving specialty palliative care in an acute hospital setting who report pain when pain screening is done on the admission evaluation/initial encounter</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This quality measure is intended for patients with serious illness who are enrolled in hospice care OR receive specialty palliative care in an acute hospital setting. Conditions may include, but are not limited to: cancer, heart disease, pulmonary disease, dementia and other progressive neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, HIV/AIDS, and advanced renal or hepatic failure. </li>
    <li>For patients enrolled in hospice, a positive screen is indicated by any pain noted in screening (any response other than none on verbal scale, any number greater than 0 on numerical scale or any observation or self-report of pain), due to the primacy of pain control and comfort care goals in hospice care. </li>
    <li>For patients receiving specialty palliative care, a positive screen is indicated by moderate or severe pain noted in screening (response of moderate or severe on verbal scale, greater than 4 on a 10-point numerical scale, or any observation or self-report of moderate to severe pain). Only management of moderate or severe pain is targeted for palliative care patients, who have more diverse care goals. Individual clinicians and patients may still decide to assess mild pain, but this subset of patients is not included in the quality measure denominator. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Patients with length of stay less than 1 day in palliative care. Patients who screen negative for pain are excluded from the denominator.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Calculation of length of stay: discharge date is identical to date of initial encounter</p></div>
