<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em><strong>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong></em>: The following guidance was current as of August 2013. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/heart.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text for additional information, including detailed information on dosing and cost of drugs as well as information on other interventions considered.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Points</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ejection fraction</span> (EF) evaluated to determine the etiology as systolic dysfunction rather than diastolic dysfunction or valvular heart disease <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)</span> to help determine if dyspnea is due to heart failure (HF) <em>[IC]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pharmacologic Therapy</strong> (see Table 1 in the original guideline document)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For patients with systolic dysfunction (EF &lt;40%) who have no contraindications:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</span> for all patients <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Beta blockers</span> for all patients except those who are hemodynamically unstable, or those who have rest dyspnea with signs of congestion <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aldosterone antagonist</span> (low dose) for all patients with symptoms of HF or with a history of hospitalization for HF <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Isosorbide dinitrate-hydralazine</span> combination for symptomatic HF patients who are African-American <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diuretics</span> for symptomatic patients to maintain appropriate fluid balance <em>[IC]</em>. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)</span> as a substitute for patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digoxin</span> only for patients who remain symptomatic despite diuretics, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers or for those in atrial fibrillation needing rate control <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Device Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implantable defibrillators</span> considered for prophylaxis against sudden cardiac death in patients with EF &le;35% <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bi-ventricular pacemakers</span> considered for patients requiring defibrillators who have symptomatic HF and QRS durations &ge;120 msec <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Caution</strong></p>
<p>HF patients on multiple medications are at risk of potential drug interactions and side effects. For example, the risk of hyperkalemia is increased in patients with renal insufficiency treated with an aldosterone antagonist and an ACE inhibitor.</p>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The literature search for this project started with the results of literature searches performed in 1998 and 2005 for earlier versions of this guideline. A new search was conducted prospectively using the major keywords of: congestive heart failure, guidelines, controlled trials, cohort studies, published 4/1/05 to 3/1/11, adults, English language on MEDLINE. Terms used for specific topic searches within the major keywords included: electrolytes; functional or stress testing; catheterization; electrogram; left ventricular ejection fraction measurement: echocardiography, sestamibi, radionuclide ventriculogram; natriuretic peptides (A-,B- [BNP], and C-type), troponin, biomarkers; education; dietary restriction; salt substitutes; exercise; devices: ICD, biventricular pacing, AICD, implantable cardiodefibrillator, LVAD; revascularization; diuretics; angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; angiotensin receptor antagonist/blocker; aldosterone antagonists; digoxin; beta blockers; vasodilators (e.g., nitrates, hydralazine); calcium channel blockers; inotropic agents; anti-arrhythmics; lipid lowering drugs; fish oil, anticoagulants, anti-thrombotics and antiplatelet agents; influenza vaccination; pneumovax immunization; coenzyme Q10; NSAIDs; narcotics; vitamin D; other complementary and alternative medicine: nutritional supplements, herbal remedies (e.g., hawthorn), chocolate, alcohol, tai chi; disease based management; telemanagement (diuretics &amp; weight); comorbid conditions: renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, anemia, sleep apnea, diabetes, depression, erectile dysfunction, dementia, arthritis, sinus node inhibition (beta blockers), hypernatremia (vasopressin antagonists); gender differences; racial differences and pharmacotherapy; end of life considerations, palliative care; any other reference identified by the major keywords and not included in results of specific topic searches. Specific search strategies are available upon request.</p>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Heart failure (HF) patients on multiple medications are at risk of potential drug interactions and side effects. For example, the risk of hyperkalemia is increased in patients with renal insufficiency treated with an aldosterone antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. </li>
    <li>Many of the medications appropriate for heart failure (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, digoxin) can affect potassium or can be affected by potassium levels and renal function. Vigilant monitoring is required. </li>

<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may cause hyperkalemia in the presence of renal failure and should be avoided or used only with great caution among patients with creatinine (Cr) &gt;2.5, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30, or potassium &gt;5.0. Both classes of agents are contraindicated in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, unilateral renal artery stenosis with solitary kidney, pregnancy, and allergies. Angioedema can occur rarely with either class of agent. </li>
    <li>Beta-blockers:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Absolute contraindications: heart block, bradycardia, severe reversible airway disease. </li>
        <li>Relative contraindications: rest dyspnea with signs of congestion, hemodynamic instability. Once these issues have resolved, beta blockers may be added to the chronic regimen. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Isordil-hydralazine cannot be used concomitantly with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil). </li>
    <li>The use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates due to profound hypotension that may develop. </li>
