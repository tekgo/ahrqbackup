<p><strong>Question 3: When Should the Initial Blood Sample Be Obtained to Perform TDM of VORI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong>: When the loading dose of VORI is given, an initial blood sample is suggested to be obtained no earlier than immediately before the 5th dose (on the 3rd day of treatment) (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: What Is the Target Trough Blood Concentration of VORI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong>: The trough blood concentration of VORI is recommended to be maintained above 0.5 mg&bull;L<sup>-1</sup> (<strong>1B, strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong>: The trough blood concentration of VORI is recommended to be maintained below 5 mg&bull;L<sup>-1</sup> (<strong>1B, strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: Under What Conditions Should TDM of VORI Be Repeated?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 7</strong>: TDM of VORI is recommended to be repeated when adjusting the VORI dosing regimen, patients show a poor response or adverse events, or when initiating or withdrawing concomitant drugs that potentially influence VORI PK (<strong>1E, strong recommendation, expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 6: How Should the VORI Dosing Regimen Be Adjusted if Necessary?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 8</strong>: Population PK methods are suggested to be used to adjust the VORI dosing regimen when a population PK model based on a native population is available (<strong>2E, conditional recommendation, expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 9</strong>: If the patient's steady-state trough blood concentration of VORI is below 0.5 mg&bull;L<sup>-1</sup> or the response is poor, maintaining dosage of VORI is suggested to be increased by 50%, followed by dosage adjustment based on the blood concentration (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 10</strong>: If the patient's steady-state trough blood concentration of VORI is within 5-10 mg&bull;L<sup>-1</sup> without &ge;grade 2 adverse events, maintaining dosage of VORI is suggested to be decreased by 20%, followed by dosage adjustment based on the blood concentration (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 11</strong>: If the patient's steady-state trough blood concentration of VORI is above 10 mg&bull;L<sup>-1</sup> or has grade 2 adverse events, VORI administration is suggested to be skipped once, with the maintenance dosage decreased by 50%, followed by dosage adjustment based on the blood concentration (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Domain 2: Special Groups of Patients</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 7: How Should VORI Be Administered to Patients with Severe Hepatic Dysfunction?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 12</strong>: For patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, VORI is not suggested for first-line treatment. After balancing the benefits and harms, VORI can be used for these patients under rigorous TDM and hepatic function monitoring (<strong>2D, conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Domain 3: Drug Safety</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 8: What Measures Should Be Taken to Rescue VORI Overdose?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 13</strong>: Temporarily withdrawing VORI, TDM and supportive treatment with evident adverse events are recommended to rescue VORI overdose (<strong>1D, strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 9: What Measures Should Be Taken to Address Common Adverse Events of VORI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 14</strong>: The recommended indications to withdraw VORI are as follows: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) level above 5 upper limits; total bilirubin (T-Bil) level above 3 upper limits; severe neurologic, psychiatric or eyesight symptoms with limiting self-care activities of daily living (ADL); skin rash covering &gt;30% body surface area (BSA), with limiting self-care ADL or sleep or with oral corticosteroid indicated (<strong>1E, strong recommendation, expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 15</strong>: The recommended indications to decrease the VORI dosage are as follows: ALT or AST level above 3 upper limits; ALP or GGT level above 2.5 upper limits; T-Bil level above 1.5 upper limits; moderate neurologic, psychiatric or eyesight symptoms with limiting instrumental use ADL; skin rash covering between 10% and 30% BSA, with limiting instrumental use ADL or with oral medications indicated (<strong>2E, conditional recommendation, expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Question 10: What Is the Compatibility of VORI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 16</strong>: Intravenous VORI is recommended to be administered alone and is incompatible with any other drugs (<strong>1E, strong recommendation, in vitro evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 17</strong>: VORI is NOT recommended to share the same Y-site tube with the drugs below: conventional amphotericin B, cefepime, cyclosporine, dantrolene, busulfan, diazepam, liposomal daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, moxifloxacin, nitroprusside, pantoprazole, phenytoin, thiopental, and tigecycline.

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Guideline Consensus Panel (GCP) identified 18 questions. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) systematically collected related evidence and completed 9 systematic reviews (3 were further updated). References were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, and 3 Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang, and Sinomed) until January 26, 2016 using the single search term "voriconazole". For some of the questions that could not be answered by a systematic review, evidence was also collected systematically via a process of searching and identifying references. Only data from Asian people were considered for safety outcomes unless the data were only available from non-Asian people. Pharmacokinetic outcomes were used as surrogates of efficacy and safety outcomes. In addition, the GDG investigated 119 patients from 9 Chinese hospitals who were taking VORI on their values and preferences towards therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of VORI and cytochrome P2C19 (CYP2C19) gene test. The hospitals were selected with regards to regions distribution, and the patients were selected through convenience sampling. A 6-minute video was played for investigated patients regarding background information for the questionnaire (i.e., explanation of medical vocabulary, potential benefits and harms of voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring [VORI TDM] and CYP2C19 gene test, costs). All the research results were presented to the GCP while formulating recommendations.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Through a 3-round Delphi and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) grid methodology, the Guideline Consensus Panel (GCP) voted on draft recommendations regarding the benefits and harms profile, quality of evidence, patients' views and preferences, and costs. GRADE evidence tables, evidence summary tables, results of patients' preferences investigation, and costs analyses were presented to the GCP. A strong recommendation required a &ge;70% approval and a conditional recommendation &ge;50%. The percentage for opposing a consensus recommendation was &le;20%.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Voriconazole blood trough concentrations have been shown to be associated with efficacy and toxicity, and thus therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is currently the best option to guide dose optimization and improve clinical outcomes. Recently, voriconazole dosed according to the prescribing information, and then followed by TDM of trough concentrations to adjust the dose, was found to be beneficial. Notably, a therapeutic failure with voriconazole is potentially life threatening.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Common adverse events of voriconazole include hepatotoxicity, nervous system/psychiatric disorders, visual disturbance, and skin disorders. </li>
    <li>High trough blood concentration of voriconazole is found to be related to a higher incidence of hepatotoxicity. </li>
    <li>Special precautions need to be taken when voriconazole is co-administered with known cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inducers, inhibitors, or substrates. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the systematic reviews "The influence of combination use of CYP450 inducers on the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole," "Effect of cytochrome P-450 inhibitors on pharmacokinetics and safety of voriconazole," "Influence of voriconazole on pharmacokinetics and safety of combined drugs" (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for additional information on drug interactions.</p>
