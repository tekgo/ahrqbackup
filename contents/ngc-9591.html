<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence <strong>(A-D, X)</strong> and the strength of the recommendation <strong>(strong recommendation, recommendation, option)</strong> are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 1</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians must ensure that insulin therapy is initiated for children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are ketotic or in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and in whom the distinction between type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM is unclear; and, in usual cases, should initiate insulin therapy for patients:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Who have random venous or plasma blood glucose (BG) concentrations &ge;250 mg/dL; or </li>
    <li>Whose hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is &gt;9% </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(Strong Recommendation: evidence quality X, validating studies cannot be performed, and C, observational studies and expert opinion; preponderance of benefit over harm.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile-Key Action Statement 1</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>X</strong> (validating studies cannot be performed) </li>
    <li>Benefits: Avoidance of progression of DKA and worsening metabolic acidosis; resolution of acidosis and hyperglycemia; avoidance of coma and/or death. Quicker restoration of glycemic control, potentially allowing islet &beta; cells to "rest and recover," increasing long-term adherence to treatment; avoiding progression to DKA if T1DM. Avoiding hospitalization. Avoidance of potential risks associated with the use of other agents (e.g., abdominal discomfort, bloating, loose stools with metformin; possible cardiovascular risks with sulfonylureas). </li>
    <li>Harms/risks/cost: Potential for hypoglycemia, insulin-induced weight gain, cost, patient discomfort from injection, necessity for BG testing, more time required by the health care team for patient training. </li>
    <li>Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Extensive clinical experience of the expert panel was relied on in making this recommendation. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Minimal. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None. </li>
    <li>Strength: <strong>Strong recommendation</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 2</strong></p>
<p>In all other instances, clinicians should initiate a lifestyle modification program, including nutrition and physical activity, and start metformin as first-line therapy for children and adolescents at the time of diagnosis of T2DM. <strong>(Strong recommendation: evidence quality B; 1 randomized control trial (RCT) showing improved outcomes with metformin versus lifestyle; preponderance of benefits over harms.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile-Key Action Statement 2</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>B</strong> (1 randomized controlled trial showing improved outcomes with metformin versus lifestyle combined with expert opinion) </li>
    <li>Benefit: Lower HbA1c, target HbA1c sustained longer, less early deterioration of BG, less chance of weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, improved lipid profile. </li>
    <li>Harm (of using metformin): Gastrointestinal adverse effects or potential for lactic acidosis and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, cost of medications, cost to administer, need for additional instruction about medication, self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG), perceived difficulty of insulin use, possible metabolic deterioration if T1DM is misdiagnosed and treated as T2DM, potential risk of lactic acidosis in the setting of ketosis or significant dehydration. It should be noted that there have been no cases reported of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency or lactic acidosis with the use of metformin in children. </li>
    <li>Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Committee members valued faster achievement of BG control over not medicating children. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Moderate; precise implementation recommendations likely will be dictated by patient preferences regarding healthy nutrition, potential medication adverse reaction, exercise, and physical activity. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: Although the recommendation to start metformin applies to all, certain children and adolescents with T2DM will not be able to tolerate metformin. In addition, certain older or more debilitated patients with T2DM may be restricted in the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise they can perform safely. Nevertheless, this recommendation applies to the vast majority of children and adolescents with T2DM. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None. </li>
    <li>Policy level: <strong>Strong recommendation</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 3</strong></p>
<p>The committee suggests that clinicians monitor HbA1c concentrations every 3 months and intensify treatment if treatment goals for BG and HbA1c concentrations are not being met. <strong>(Option: evidence quality D; expert opinion and studies in children with T1DM and in adults with T2DM; preponderance of benefits over harms.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile-Key Action Statement 3</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>D</strong> (expert opinion and studies in children with T1DM and in adults with T2DM; no studies have been performed in children and adolescents with T2DM) </li>
    <li>Benefit: Diminishing the risk of progression of disease and deterioration resulting in hospitalization; prevention of microvascular complications of T2DM. </li>
    <li>Harm: Potential for hypoglycemia from overintensifying treatment to reach HbA1c target goals; cost of frequent testing and medical consultation; possible patient discomfort. </li>
    <li>Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Recommendation dictated by widely accepted standards of diabetic care. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Minimal; recommendation dictated by widely accepted standards of diabetic care. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Intentional vagueness in the recommendation as far as setting goals and intensifying treatment attributable to limited evidence. </li>
    <li>Policy level: <strong>Option</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 4</strong></p>
<p>The committee suggests that clinicians advise patients to monitor finger-stick BG concentrations in those who:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Are taking insulin or other medications with a risk of hypoglycemia; or </li>
    <li>Are initiating or changing their diabetes treatment regimen; or </li>
    <li>Have not met treatment goals; or </li>
    <li>Have intercurrent illnesses </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(Option: evidence quality D; expert consensus. Preponderance of benefits over harms.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile-Key Action Statement 4</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>D</strong> (expert consensus) </li>
    <li>Benefit: Potential for improved metabolic control, improved potential for prevention of hypoglycemia, decreased long-term complications. </li>
    <li>Harm: Patient discomfort, cost of materials. </li>
    <li>Benefits-harms assessment: Benefit over harm. </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Despite lack of evidence, there were general committee perceptions that patient safety concerns related to insulin use or clinical status outweighed any risks from monitoring. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Moderate to low; recommendation driven primarily by safety concerns. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Intentional vagueness in the recommendation about specific approaches attributable to lack of evidence and the need to individualize treatment. </li>
    <li>Policy level: <strong>Option</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 5</strong></p>
<p>The committee suggests that clinicians incorporate the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' <em>Pediatric Weight Management Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guidelines</em> in the nutrition counseling of patients with T2DM both at the time of diagnosis and as part of ongoing management. <strong>(Option; evidence quality D; expert opinion; preponderance of benefits over harms. Role of patient preference is dominant.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile-Key Action Statement 5</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>D </strong>(expert consensus) </li>
    <li>Benefit: Promotes weight loss; improves insulin sensitivity; contributes to glycemic control; prevents worsening of disease; facilitates a sense of well-being; and improves cardiovascular health. </li>
    <li>Harm: Costs of nutrition counseling; inadequate reimbursement of clinicians' time; lost opportunity costs vis-a-vis time and resources spent in other counseling activities. </li>
    <li>Benefits-harms assessment: Benefit over harm. </li>
    <li>Value judgments: There is a broad societal agreement on the benefits of dietary recommendations. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Dominant. Patients may have different preferences for how they wish to receive assistance in managing their weight-loss goals. Some patients may prefer a referral to a nutritionist while others might prefer accessing online sources of help. Patient preference should play a significant role in determining an appropriate weight-loss strategy. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Intentional vagueness in the recommendation about specific approaches attributable to lack of evidence and the need to individualize treatment. </li>
    <li>Policy level: <strong>Option</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 6</strong></p>
<p>The committee suggests that clinicians encourage children and adolescents with T2DM to engage in moderate-to-vigorous exercise for at least 60 minutes daily and to limit nonacademic screen time to less than 2 hours per day. <strong>(Option: evidence quality D, expert opinion and evidence from studies of metabolic syndrome and obesity; preponderance of benefits over harms. Role of patient preference is dominant.)</strong></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile-Key Action Statement 6</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>D</strong> (expert opinion and evidence from studies of metabolic syndrome and obesity). </li>
    <li>Benefit: Promotes weight loss; contributes to glycemic control; prevents worsening of disease; facilitates the ability to perform exercise; improves the person's sense of well-being; and fosters cardiovascular health. </li>
    <li>Harm: Cost for patient of counseling, food, and time; costs for clinician in taking away time that could be spent on other activities; inadequate reimbursement for clinician's time. </li>
    <li>Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Broad consensus. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Dominant. Patients may seek various forms of exercise. Patient preference should play a significant role in creating an exercise plan. </li>
    <li>Exclusions: Although certain older or more debilitated patients with T2DM may be restricted in the amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise they can perform safely, this recommendation applies to the vast majority of children and adolescents with T2DM. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Intentional vagueness on the sequence of follow-up contact attributable to the lack of evidence and the need to individualize care. </li>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>A literature search was performed in Medline, the Cochrane Collaboration, and Embase. Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms used in various combinations in the search included diabetes, mellitus, type 2, type 1, treatment, prevention, diet, pediatric, T2DM, T1DM, NIDDM, metformin, lifestyle, RCT, meta-analysis, child, adolescent, therapeutics, control, adult, obese, gestational, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular, dyslipidemia, men, and women. In addition, the Boolean operators NOT, AND, OR were included in various combinations. Articles addressing treatment of diabetes mellitus were prospectively limited to those that were published in English between January 1990 and June 2008, included abstracts, and addressed children between the ages of 120 and 215 months with an established diagnosis of T2DM. Studies in adults were considered for inclusion if &gt;10% of the study population was 45 years of age or younger. The Medline search limits included the following: clinical trial; meta-analysis; randomized controlled trial; review; child: 6&ndash;12 years; and adolescent: 13&ndash;18 years. Additional articles were identified by review of reference lists of relevant articles and ongoing studies recommended by a technical expert advisory group. All articles were reviewed for compliance with the search limitations and appropriateness for inclusion in this document.</p>
<p>An additional literature search of Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed in July 2009 for articles discussing recommendations for screening and treatment of 5 recognized comorbidities of T2DM: cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral vascular disease. Search criteria were the same as for the search on treatment of T2DM, with the inclusion of the term "type 1 diabetes mellitus." Search terms included, in various combinations, the following: diabetes, mellitus, type 2, type 1, pediatric, T2DM, T1DM, NIDDM, hyperlipidemia, retinopathy, microalbuminuria, comorbidities, screening, RCT, meta-analysis, child, and adolescent. Boolean operators and search limits mirrored those of the primary search.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>An epidemiologist appraised the methodologic quality of the research before it was considered by the committee members.</p>
<p>The evidence-based approach to guideline development requires that the evidence in support of each key action statement be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and recommendations be defined. Evidence-based recommendations reflect the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the recommendation is followed. The AAP policy statement, "Classifying Recommendations for Clinical Practice Guidelines," was followed in designating levels of recommendation (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields).</p></div>

In some cases, supporting references for a specific recommendation are provided that do not deal specifically with childhood T2DM, such as T1DM, childhood obesity, or childhood "prediabetes," or that were not included in the original comprehensive search.
