<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States (U.S.). It is a complex, multifaceted, chronic disease that is affected by environmental, genetic, physiological, metabolic, behavioral and psychological components. Approximately 127 million American adults are overweight, 60 million are obese and 9 million are severely obese (American Obesity Association [AOA], 2005). Obesity affects every ethnicity, socioeconomic class and geographic region in the U.S. This disease has been growing by epidemic proportions, with the prevalence increasing by approximately 50 percent per decade. Obesity's impact on individual overall health has drastically increased as well. It increases both morbidity and mortality rates and the risk of conditions such as diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD) and cancer. It has a substantial negative effect on longevity, reducing the length of life of people who are severely obese by an estimated 5 to 20 years (Olshansky et al., 2005). Overweight and obesity are also contributing causes to more than 50 percent of all-cause mortality among American adults aged 20 to 74, which results in a significant economic impact&mdash;approximately $99.2 billion is spent annually on obesity-related medical care and disability in the U.S. (Thomas et al., 2003). </p>
<p>It is estimated that the aggregate cost of obesity ranges from 5 to 7 percent of the total of annual medical expenditures in the U.S. ($75 billion per year) (Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, &amp; Wang, 2003; Finkelstein, Ruhm, &amp; Kosa, 2005). In 1994 the estimated cost of obesity to U.S. business was $12.7 billion ($10.1 billion due to moderate or severe obesity; $2.6 billion due to mild obesity). Obesity-attributable business expenditures include paid sick leave, life insurance and health insurance, totaling $2.4 billion, $1.8 billion and $800 million, respectively (Thompson et al., 1998). Not only is the prevalence of obesity increasing, but the relative per capita spending among obese Americans is also increasing. That increase accounted for 27 percent of the growth in real per capita spending between 1987 and 2001. Within that period, the prevalence of obesity increased by 10.3 percentage points, to almost 24 percent of the adult population (Thorpe et al., 2004). The rise in obesity is directly correlated to drastic increases in three major conditions: diabetes, hyperlipidemia and heart disease. The increase in per capita spending is caused by the increase in obesity prevalence and the increase in spending on the obese, relative to those of normal weight (Thompson et al., 1998). </p>
<p>Guidelines from various organizations, including the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI); the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF); the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI); and the Michigan Quality Improvement Consortium, indicate that the first step in weight management is assessment of height and weight in order to calculate a patient's body mass index (BMI). </p>
<p>BMI is considered the most efficient and effective method for assessing excess body fat; it is a starting point for assessing the relationship between weight and height, and it is the most conducive method of assessment in the primary care setting (NHLBI, 2001).</p></div>
