Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of pediatric patients age 3 to 17 years who have had an overweight/obesity assessment and if body mass index (BMI) percentile is greater than or equal to 85 have appropriate documentation of counseling for physical activity and nutrition.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The number of United States children and adolescents who are overweight or obese continues to rise (Ogden et al., 2002). According to the 2007 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, nearly 17% of children ages 2 to 19 are obese and almost 32% are overweight or obese (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2010).</p>
<p>In 2009, the body mass index (BMI) documentation rate reported by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) (2010) was 35% for commercially insured patients and 30% for Medicaid patients.</p>
<p>Bright Futures guidelines reports that although a child's weight status is the result of a number of factors (genes, metabolism, height, behavior and environment) working together, two of the most important determinants of weight status are nutrition and physical activity. Children older than two years who are between the 85th and 95th percentile of BMI need a second-level assessment and screening, and treatment which includes interventions focused on dietary changes/nutrition and physical activity.</p>
<p>Pilot testing of measure with 13 medical groups representing 116 clinics and 42,906 patients demonstrated that participating clinics are successfully assessing their patient population for obesity, with the prevalence of BMI percentile greater than 85 at 27.4% (overweight 14.8%, obese 12.6%) but demonstrated opportunity for improvement and variability among practices for providing counseling to overweight children with an overall average rate of 68.3%.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>MN Community Measurement (MNCM) conducts validity testing to determine if quality measures truly measure what they are designed to measure, and conducts reliability testing to determine if measures yield stable, consistent results. Validity testing is done to see if the concept behind the measure reflects the quality of care that is provided to a patient and if the measure, as specified, accurately assesses the intended quality concept. Reliability testing is done to see if calculated performance scores are reproducible.</p></div>
