Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with clinical stage IB or higher, but no evidence of metastatic disease, who have had a mediastinal lymph node sampling procedure performed prior to the initiation of curative intent therapy.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patients with clinical stage IB or higher have a clinically significant likelihood of having undetected mediastinal lymph node metastases. Treatment of regionally metastatic lung cancer is different than localized lung cancer. Treatment of regionally metastatic lung cancer is more successful if detected prior to the initiation of curative intent therapy.</p></div>
