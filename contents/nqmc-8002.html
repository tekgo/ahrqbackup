Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the total resource use index population-based per member per month (PMPM).</p>
<p>The Resource Use Index (RUI) is a risk adjusted measure of the frequency and intensity of services utilized to manage a provider's patients. Resource use includes all resources associated with treating members including professional, facility inpatient and outpatient, pharmacy, lab, radiology, ancillary and behavioral health services. </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Calculations</strong>:</p>
<p class="Note">Risk Adjusted Total Resource Use PMPM = Total Resource PMPM / Risk Score</p>
<p class="Note">RUI = Risk Adjusted Resource Use PMPM / Peer Group Average Risk Adjusted Resource Use PMPM</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 2009, health care spending represented 17.6 percent of the United States gross domestic product (GDP) and it is expected to continue to rise to over 20 percent by 2018. This is the largest percentage of any developed nation in the world. Rising costs prohibit many from being able to afford insurance coverage and largely contributes to personal bankruptcies. Consequently, affordability of care has become an increasingly discussed issue. In spite of this, few publicly available cost and resource use measures exist. In 1995, HealthPartners developed the Total Cost of Care measure to bring awareness of health care costs to providers and patients, and to drive improved value for the health care dollar. </p>
<p>HealthPartners' population-based Total Cost of Care and Total Resource Use measures provide valuable information to health plans and providers on how to make health care more affordable without sacrificing quality or experience. Health plans and providers can use cost and resource use data to identify areas where they can lower cost by improving resource use or shifting to less expensive, yet equally effective resources &mdash; for example, use of a surgery center instead of a hospital where it is medically appropriate, without negatively impacting quality. Evidence supports this idea as depicted in various studies on diabetes care, in academic medical centers, across metropolitan statistical areas and in group practices in Minnesota. These studies conclude that increased cost does not result in increased quality, while quality is not sacrificed when resource use is optimized.</p>
<p>A key benefit of HealthPartners' population-based Total Cost of Care and Resource Use measures is the identification of potential overuse and underuse of health care services. For example, a primary care physician may be referring back pain patients to an orthopedic surgeon. Rather than managing the back pain in primary care, these patients may have increased specialist costs and potentially more back surgeries than would be expected for their population. Overuse of health care services has led to wide variation in health care cost and use across geographies. Studies suggest that Medicare spending would be decreased by almost 30 percent if medium and high spending geographies consumed health care services comparable to that of lower spending regions. Experts agree that reducing overuse can make care safer and more efficient.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>To test the reliability of the Total Cost Index (TCI) and Resource Use Index (RUI) measures, the measures were applied to HealthPartners primary care Twin Cities metro area providers according to the measure specifications. Results were calculated for 2007, 2008 and 2009. </p>
<p>To measure the reliability of the TCI and RUI measures, a 90 percent random sample and a bootstrapping technique were employed. In these methods, reliability is measured as the mean of the variance between sampling iterations and the actual results. In addition, TCI and RUI measures were analyzed over time to demonstrate stability and sensitivity to provider changes or improvement initiatives. </p>
<p>In the 90 percent random sample method, members attributed to a provider group were randomly sampled at the 90 percent membership level without replacement. This was done to simulate variation within a provider group by leveraging their own population and case-mix. This method gives an indication of the repeatability of the measure by comparing how closely the actual total cost and resource use measures are to the 90 percent sampled averages. It also simulates any potential member selection bias. </p>
<p>In the bootstrapping method, members attributed to a provider group were randomly selected with replacement. This method maximizes variation around a provider group's total cost of care and resource use as each randomly selected iteration (sample population) does not truly represent the provider's case mix of patients. This method was performed using the same technique as the 90 percent random sample method to support and validate the results found.</p>
<p>To assess validity, the total cost of care and resource use measures were applied to HealthPartners primary care Twin Cities metro area providers according to the measure specifications. Additional standard utilization metrics were also applied to the underlying data in the actual and risk adjusted forms. The TCI and RUI findings are compared by provider group to the actual and risk adjusted utilization metrics to determine the accuracy of conclusions. </p>
<p>The total cost of care and resource use measures can differentiate between providers based on the cost per member and/or consumption of resources per member, if all other factors are equal. The Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) adjustment controls for variations in illness burden of the patients and peer grouping controls for various patient demographics, provider types and types of product. The remaining factors reflect what the provider can potentially impact. </p>
<p>Various strengths of correlation are seen between the total cost of care and resource use measures and known utilization metrics. These correlation strengths depend upon how fully encompassing the utilization metric is within the component being measured and whether the metrics are risk adjusted. For example, the admit count utilization measure is highly correlated to inpatient resource use, since the only factor not accounted for in the admit count measure is intensity (i.e., level of treatment). When risk adjustment is applied, the correlation is reduced as the illness burden variation is removed. </p>
<p>These measures are designed to evaluate the entire patient and/or provider. Since a person-centered measure does not currently exist, utilization metrics are used as a proxy to evaluate the correctness and accuracy of the conclusions drawn by the total cost of care and resource use measures. These comparisons and correlations should be considered directional and are not absolute. Utilization metrics do not measure intensity or cost per unit and are targeted to measure a specific service. Therefore the correlations to the total cost of care and resource use need interpretation, as high correlation is not always the ultimate goal or the expected result.</p></div>

    <li>To determine which members to include in the Total Resource Use measure, there are several options available depending upon the business purpose and unit of measure. If the unit of measure is an entire community or health plan, all members should be included in the Total Resource Use measure. If the unit of measure is a provider group and members are required to select a provider, HealthPartners recommends using the member selected provider. When the member is not required to select a provider, the use of an attribution algorithm to identify the member's principal provider is recommended. </li>
    <li>Eligibility data is required to determine the number of months the member is active during the measurement period (member months). HealthPartners' measurement requires member to be active at least 9 of the 12 medical months of the measurement period to be included in this measure. </li>
