<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Expeditious and careful transport of patients with acute cervical spine or spinal cord injuries (SCIs) is recommended from the site of injury by the most appropriate mode of transportation available to the nearest capable definitive care medical facility.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Whenever possible, the transport of patients with acute cervical spine or SCIs to specialized acute SCI treatment centers is recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p>
<p>The patient with an acute cervical spinal injury or SCI should be expeditiously and carefully transported from the site of injury to the nearest capable definitive care medical facility. The mode of transportation chosen should be based on the patient's clinical circumstances, distance from target facility, and geography to be traveled and should be the most rapid means available. Immobilization of patients with acute cervical spinal cord and/or spinal column injuries is recommended. Cervical SCIs have a high incidence of airway compromise and pulmonary dysfunction; therefore, respiratory support measures should be available during transport. Several studies cited suggest improved morbidity and mortality of spinal cord-injured patients after the advent of sophisticated transport systems to dedicated SCI treatment centers. These studies all provide <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence on this issue.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search from 1966 to 2011 was completed using Medical Subject Headings in combination with "spinal injury" and "transport." The search was limited to the English language and yielded 10,008 citations for the first search term and 71,323 articles for the second. A search combining both search terms provided 259 articles. All 259 abstracts were reviewed. Additional references were culled from the reference lists of the remaining articles. Finally, members of the author group were asked to contribute articles known to them on the subject matter that were not found by other search means. A total of 16 articles directly relevant to the subject of transportation of spine-injured patients were identified. All provided Class III medical evidence.</p></div>

<p>Articles that did not achieve immediate consensus among the author group were discussed extensively until a consensus was reached. Very few contributions required extensive discussion.

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
