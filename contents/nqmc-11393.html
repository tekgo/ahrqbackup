Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the risk-adjusted standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR) for dialysis facility patients. This measure is calculated as a ratio, but can also be expressed as a rate.</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Hospitalization rates are an important indicator of patient morbidity and quality of life. On average, dialysis patients are admitted to the hospital twice a year and spend an average of 11.2 days in the hospital per year (U.S. Renal Data System, 2015). Hospitalizations account for approximately 40 percent of total Medicare expenditures for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (U.S. Renal Dialysis System, 2015). Measures of the frequency of hospitalization have the potential to help efforts to control escalating medical costs, and to play an important role in identifying potential problems and helping facilities provide cost-effective health care.</p>
<p>At the end of 2013 there were 661,648 patients being dialyzed of which 117,162 were new (incident) ESRD patients (U.S. Renal Dialysis System, 2015). In 2013, total Medicare costs for the ESRD program were $30.9 billion, a 1.6% increase from 2012 (U.S. Renal Dialysis System, 2015). Correspondingly, hospitalization costs for ESRD patients are very high with Medicare costs of over $10.3 billion in 2013. </p>
<p>Hospitalization measures have been in use in the Dialysis Facility Reports (formerly Unit-Specific Reports) since 1995. The Dialysis Facility Reports are used by the dialysis facilities and ESRD networks for quality improvement, and by ESRD state surveyors for monitoring and surveillance. In particular, the standardized hospital ratio (SHR) for Admissions is used by ESRD state surveyors in conjunction with other standard criteria for prioritizing and selecting facilities to survey and has been found to be predictive of citations in the past (ESRD State Outcomes List).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The reliability of the standardized hospital ratio (SHR) was assessed using data among Medicare end stage renal disease (ESRD) dialysis patients during 2010-2013. If the measure were a simple average across individuals in the facility, the usual approach for determining measure reliability would be a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The inter-unit reliability (IUR) measures the proportion of the total variation of a measure that is attributable to the between-facility variation. The SHR, however, is not a simple average and the developer instead estimates the IUR using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. A small IUR (near 0) reveals that most of the variation of the measures between facilities is driven by random noise, indicating the measure would not be a good characterization of the differences among facilities, whereas a large IUR (near 1) indicates that most of the variation between facilities is due to the real difference between facilities.</p>
<p>The SHR calculation only included facilities with at least 5 patient years at risk.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>Overall, the developer found that IURs for the one-year SHRs have a range of 0.70-0.72 across the years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, which indicates that over two-thirds of the variation in the one-year SHR can be attributed to the between-facility differences and less than one-third to within-facility variation.</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>This value of IUR indicates a high degree of reliability. When stratified by facility size, the developer finds that, as expected, larger facilities have greater IUR.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer has assessed the validity of the measure through various comparisons of this measure with other quality measures in use, using Spearman correlations.</p>
<p>The measure is also maintained on face validity. Hospitalization measures were reviewed by a technical expert panel (TEP) in 2007 and overall measures based on admissions and on days were recommended for inclusion in the Dialysis Facility Reports. In 2015, a TEP was held specifically to consider prevalent comorbidity adjustments for inclusion in the measure. The TEP's recommendations are reflected in the risk adjustment methodology. In addition, hospitalization is a major cost factor in the management of ESRD patients as noted earlier, further establishing a very strong case for face validity of the SHR admissions measure.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>The SHR Admissions measure is correlated with the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for each individual year from 2010-2013, where Spearman's correlation ranged from 0.27 to 0.30, with all four correlations being highly significant (p less than 0.0001). Also, for each year from 2011-2013, the SHR was correlated with the Standardized Readmission Ratio (SRR) (Spearman's rho = 0.54, 0.50, 0.48; p less than 0.0001).</p>
<p>In addition, SHR Admissions is negatively correlated in each of the four years with percent of patients in the facility with arteriovenous (AV) fistula (Spearman's rho = -0.12, -0.15, -0.12, -0.13). Thus higher values of SHR are associated with lower usage of AV fistulas. Further, SHR admissions is positively correlated in each of the four years with percent of patients with catheter greater than or equal to 90 days (Spearman's rho = 0.21, 0.21, 0.18, 0.16), indicating that higher values of SHR are associated with increased use of catheters. These correlations are all highly significant (p less than 0.001). For each year of 2010 through 2013, the SHR Admissions is also found to be negatively correlated with the percent of hemodialysis patients with Kt/V greater than or equal to 1.2, again in the direction expected (Spearman's who = -0.11, -0.13, -0.10, -0.11; p less than 0.0001). Lower SHRs are associated with a higher percentage of patients receiving adequate dialysis dose.</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The SHR correlates with outcomes, processes of care, and causes of hospitalization that are commonly thought to be potentially related to poor quality of care. Higher hospitalization was associated with higher facility mortality rates and similarly with higher readmissions. The developer found higher values of SHR are associated with lower usage of AV fistulas, higher catheter use, and suboptimal dialysis adequacy. The 2007 TEP considered the possibility of developing cause specific SHRs, but recommended the use of all-cause SHR measures due to various reasons including the lack of clear research to indicate what causes (i.e., reason for admission) should be selected as valid indicators of poor ESRD care, and issues associated with inter-rater reliability in assessing cause of hospitalization. The TEP reached a strong consensus that the all-cause measure would be reliable and valid and the measure would typically be related to quality of care. The developer has some crude measures of cause of hospitalization which they have used to assess the relationship between the all-cause measure and cause specific components. These measures are useful in assessing the overall SHR measures, but the developer cautions that the cause specific hospitalizations have not been tested or validated at this time. All correlations are in the expected direction and highly significant, (p less than 0.0001). Thus these preliminary analyses show that the overall hospitalization rate also correlates with specific causes that are commonly thought to be potentially related to poor quality of care. In 2015, a TEP was held specifically to consider prevalent comorbidity adjustments for inclusion in this measure (and SMR). The TEP's recommendations are reflected in the risk adjustment methodology.</p></div>

Number of hospital admissions that would be expected among eligible patients at the facility during the reporting period, given the patient mix at the facility</p>
<p>As patients can receive dialysis treatment at more than one facility in a given year, the developer assigns each patient day to a facility (or no facility, in some cases) based on a set of conventions.</p>
<p>Though a patient's follow-up in the database can be incomplete during the first 90 days of end stage renal disease (ESRD) therapy, the developer only includes a patient's follow-up in the tabulations after that patient has received chronic renal replacement therapy for at least 90 days. Thus, hospitalizations, mortality and survival during the first 90 days of ESRD do not enter into the calculations. This minimum 90-day period also assures that most patients are eligible for Medicare, either as their primary or secondary insurer. It also excludes from analysis patients who die or recover renal function during the first 90 days of ESRD.</p>
<p>In order to exclude patients who only received temporary dialysis therapy, the developer assigns patients to a facility only after they have been on dialysis there for the past 60 days. This 60 day period is used both for patients who started ESRD for the first time and for those who returned to dialysis after a transplant. That is, hospitalizations during the first 60 days of dialysis at a facility do not affect the standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR) of that facility.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The regression model used to compute a facility's "expected" number of hospitalizations for this measure contains many factors thought to be associated with hospitalization rates. Specifically, the model adjusts for patient age, sex, diabetes as cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD), duration of ESRD, nursing home status, body mass index (BMI) at incidence, individual comorbidities at incidence, and calendar year. The stage 1 model allows the baseline hospitalization rates to vary between strata, which are defined by facilities, but assumes that the regression coefficients are the same across all strata; this approach is robust to possible differences between facilities in the patient mix being treated. In essence, it avoids a possible confounding between facility effects and patient covariates as can arise, for example, if patients with favorable values of the covariate tend to be treated at facilities with better treatment policies and outcomes. Thus, for example, if patients with diabetes as a cause of ESRD tended to be treated at better facilities, one would underestimate the effect of diabetes unless the model is adjusted for facility. In this model, this is done by stratification. Refer to the original measure documentation for additional information.</p></div>
