<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients admitted to a hospital-based inpatient psychiatric setting who are screened within the first three days of admission for all of the following: risk of violence to self or others, substance use, psychological trauma history and patient strengths.</p>
<p>This measure represents the overall rate. The following rates are also reported:</p>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Substantial evidence exists that there is a high prevalence of co-occurring substance use disorders as well as history of trauma among persons admitted to acute psychiatric settings. Professional literature suggests that these factors are under-identified yet integral to current psychiatric status and should be assessed in order to develop appropriate treatment (Ziedonis, 2004; National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors [NASMHPD], 2005). Similarly, persons admitted to inpatient settings require a careful assessment of risk for violence and the use of seclusion and restraint. Careful assessment of risk is critical to safety and treatment. Effective, individualized treatment relies on assessments that explicitly recognize patients' strengths. These strengths may be characteristics of the individuals themselves, supports provided by families and others, or contributions made by the individuals' community or cultural environment (Rapp, 1998). In the same way, inpatient environments require assessment for factors that lead to conflict or less than optimal outcomes.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Suicide is a major public health epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the rates of suicide have not decreased in 100 years and remain the 11th leading cause of death in the United States. Ninety percent of those completing suicide have a psychiatric diagnosis at the time of death with depression and alcohol abuse most commonly noted. Over 80 million people in the United States are at risk for suicide due to mental illness and substance use disorders and about 30,000 Americans each year die by suicide. It is estimated that the cost to society in lost productivity each year is approximately $11 billion. </li>
    <li>A defensive measure benefiting the patient is documentation of a suicide risk assessment. According to Hirschfeld &amp; Russell (1997), many physicians and even mental health providers are hesitant to inquire about suicide with the fear of provoking the risk of suicide or likely due to discomfort discussing the topic. Assessment of suicide risk is an essential component to recognizing the problem and formulating the appropriate treatment plan for all patients acute enough to warrant inpatient level of care. </li>
    <li>McNiel et al. (2008) assert that violence risk assessment varies widely and frequently is not incorporated into training programs for psychiatric residents, leaving some patients at risk for violence to self and others. A crucial component of all risk assessment includes screening for suicidal and homicidal ideation. </li>
    <li>In the National Crime Victimization Survey for 1993 to 1999 which was conducted by the Department of Justice, the annual rate of nonfatal, job-related violent crime against psychiatrists and mental health professionals was 68.2 per 1,000 and 69.0 per 1,000 for mental health custodial workers as compared to 12.6 per 1,000 for workers in all occupations. According to Swanson (1994), the lifetime prevalence of violent behavior ranges from 16.1% for those with schizophrenia spectrum or a major affective disorder to 43.6% for those with a serious mental illness (SMI) with co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD). </li>
    <li>A review of 27 studies on patient violence performed by Johnson (2004) supports the need for a careful risk assessment to determine which patients are at risk for violent and aggressive behavior while in the inpatient psychiatric care setting. Recently The Joint Commission released a Sentinel Event Alert on preventing violence in the health care setting which reported 256 violent events from 1995 through June 2010 in the Sentinel Event Database resulting in patient assault, homicide or rape. </li>
    <li>SUD has been identified as a risk factor for violence. Those with co-occurring SUD and SMI who are non-compliant with medications in particular are susceptible to committing violent acts. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) estimates that 4.6 million American adults have both SUD and mental illness. Additionally, unrecognized alcohol use disorder can result in the life threatening condition delirium tremens. </li>
    <li>Excessive use of alcohol and drugs has a substantial harmful impact on health and society in the United States. It is a drain on the economy and a source of enormous personal tragedy. In 1998 the economic costs to society were $185 billion for alcohol misuse and $143 billion was attributable to drug problems. Health care spending was $19 billion for alcohol problems, and $14 billion for drug problems. Nearly a quarter of one trillion dollars in lost productivity is attributable to substance use. It is therefore critical to screen for the joint presence of these two elements of Hospital-based Inpatient Psychiatric Services (HBIPS) 1 in order to develop a comprehensive approach to treatment. </li>
    <li>Co-occurring, unrecognized SUD also results in an increased risk of psychiatric relapse, poor medication compliance, violence to self and others and legal problems. Patients with SMI will often downplay or deny SUD; therefore, a timeline of past and present substance use should be performed during the initial screening process. Mallin et al. (2002) also note low rates of screening for SUD in depressed patients. The high rate of co-occurring SUD and mental illness points to the need for an initial screening identifying those patients with SUD in order to develop a comprehensive approach to evaluation and treatment for both disorders. </li>
    <li>Between 51% and 98% of public mental health patients have trauma histories. Lack of consistent screening contributes to under detection of trauma histories. Trauma when left untreated can result in negative patient outcomes such as hallucinations, depression, suicidal acts, anxiety, hostility, dissociation and poor social skills and hospital readmission. Additionally, trauma victims are at an increased risk for substance use disorders, violence victimization, self-injury, serious social problems and premature death. </li>
    <li>The financial burden to society of undiagnosed and untreated trauma is staggering. The economic costs of untreated trauma-related alcohol and drug abuse were estimated at $160.7 billion in 2000. Additionally, the cost to society of child abuse and neglect is $94 billion annually, and for child abuse survivors, long-term psychiatric and medical costs reach $100 billion annually. </li>
    <li>Alarmingly high rates of childhood trauma exposure, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) co-morbidity and current victimization exist among people with SMI treated in public sector settings. Statistics showed incest histories in 46% of chronically psychotic women on a hospital unit, and significant trauma exposure in 90% of patients in a multi-site program for co-morbid substance-abuse and mental illness. Only 35% of both groups of patients carried a diagnosis of PTSD. </li>
    <li>Although the high prevalence of significant psychological trauma among patients with serious and persistent mental illness is well known, and even where it is duly recorded in initial psychiatric histories, such trauma is rarely reflected in the primary (or secondary) diagnosis. A history of trauma, even when significant, generally appears only in the category of "developmental history", and thus does not become the focus of treatment. </li>
    <li>Assessment models based on patient deficits, rather than patient strengths, reduce patient motivation and portray the patient as weak and helpless rather than empowered, and run counter to the national Recovery Movement that has been a hallmark of patient advocacy and treatment engagement for the past decade. The strengths-based approach to case management has emerged over the past few years as a way to influence both the well-being and coping of patients with SMI. Lyons et al. (2000) examined the patient strengths model in 15 residential treatment centers for children and adolescents across Florida. Their findings also support the importance of strengths and the use of an integrated model incorporating both psychopathology and strengths as a part of the treatment plan. And finally, the patient strengths approach allows the clinician to systematically screen for the patient's survival skills, abilities, knowledge, resources and desires that can be used to help them reach their goals. </li>
    <li>When performing an initial psychiatric screening for patient strengths, cultural factors related to the psychosocial environment and the patient's level of functioning must be taken into consideration, as well as their available network system of support. Cultural factors may influence many aspects of mental illness, including how a patient from a given culture communicates, his or her style of coping, and his or her family and community supports when eliciting patient strengths. </li>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Alpha testing was conducted during May and June 2006 at approximately 40 volunteer test sites to assess feasibility and data collection effort. A set of measures was recommended by the Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) to comprise the final test set addressing the domains of Assessment, Patient Safety and Continuity/Transitions of Care.</p>
<p>The Specification Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures Hospital-Based Inpatient Psychiatric Services Test Set was finalized in September 2006. In late 2006 a total of 196 hospitals volunteered to participate in the Hospital-Based Inpatient Psychiatric Services (HBIPS) pilot test. Data collection for the test set began with January 1, 2007 discharges and continued throughout December 31, 2007.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of the pilot test, a subset of 39 hospitals was randomly selected to collect and transmit monthly hospital clinical data (HCD) to help assess data quality and data reliability. The data quality study continued with data collection and transmission for the 12 months of 2007. Feedback on data quality was provided to each performance measurement systems vendor submitting HCD.</p>
<p>The final phase of testing consisted of site visits to a sample of participating pilot hospitals to assess the reliability of data abstracted and reported by those hospitals. Reliability test site visits were conducted at 18 randomly selected pilot hospitals. Selection of the test sites was based on multiple characteristics, including hospital demographics, populations served, bed size and type of facility.</p>
<p>All of the HBIPS measures have undergone a rigorous process of public comment, alpha testing and broad-scale pilot testing and are recognized by the field as important indicators of hospital-based inpatient psychiatric care. </p></div>
