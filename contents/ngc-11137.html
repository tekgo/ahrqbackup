Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN)</strong>: The original guideline document provides guidance for creating a safe environment of care for patients undergoing minimally invasive surgical procedures. The guideline addresses distention media used during endoscopic procedures, hybrid operating rooms (ORs), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hybrid ORs, navigation-guided procedures, and robotic-assisted surgery. The document provides guidance to perioperative personnel to reduce risks to patients and perioperative team members during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and computer-assisted technology procedures; perioperative registered nurses (RNs) to assist in managing distention media (e.g., gas, fluid) and irrigation fluid; and health care organizations for incorporating advancements in technology with consideration for workplace safety and ergonomics.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>Health care organizations should establish a multidisciplinary team to create an efficient, safe environment for minimally invasive procedures. </li>
    <li>Potential patient injuries and complications associated with gas insufflation media used during MIS procedures should be identified, and practices that reduce the risk for injuries and complications should be established. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should identify potential injuries and complications associated with fluid used for irrigation or as distention media during MIS and computer-assisted procedures. </li>
    <li>Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk for injury associated with the use of energy-generating devices during MIS. </li>
    <li>The perioperative team should identify potential risks for injury and complications associated with computer-assisted surgical procedures and should implement safe practices. </li>
    <li>The health care organization should determine the requirements for the design and operation of the hybrid OR for surgical or invasive procedures. </li>
    <li>The health care organization should identify risks for injury and complications associated with intraoperative MRI procedures and establish safe practices regardless of magnet format or field strength. </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should receive education and complete competency verification activities in the perioperative nursing care of patients who undergo MIS and computer-assisted procedures. </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for MIS and computer-assisted procedures should be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting in which they are used. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>In January 2016, a medical librarian conducted systematic searches of the databases MEDLINE&reg;, CINAHL&reg;, and Scopus&reg; and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, limiting the results to articles published in English after 2009. During the development of this guideline, the lead author requested supplementary searches for topics not included in the original search as well as articles and other sources that were discovered during the evidence appraisal process. The lead author and the medical librarian also identified relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies.</p>
<p>Search terms included the subject headings and keywords <em>minimally invasive surgical procedures, robotic surgical procedures, angioscopy, morcellation, interventional magnetic resonance imaging, interventional radiography, interventional ultrasonography, angioplasty, endoscopy, cholangiography,</em> and<em>hybrid operating room</em>, as well as headings and keywords identifying specific procedures. Patient monitoring and procedural complications were addressed by headings and keywords that included <em>nursing assessment, intraoperative and postoperative complications, intraoperative and physiologic monitoring, fluid monitoring, insufflation, extravasation, pneumoperitoneum, intraabdominal pressure, TUR syndrome,</em> and <em>compartment syndrome</em>. Occupational risks related to minimally invasive surgery were included in the search with terms such as <em>human engineering, occupational injuries, ergonomics, musculoskeletal injuries,</em> and <em>occupational accidents</em>.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and lower-level or lower-quality evidence when higher-level or higher-quality evidence was available. Surgical techniques (e.g., open versus closed technique, trocar insertion, natural orifice technique, single-incision laparoscopic surgery) and anesthesia techniques (e.g., goal-directed fluid therapy), endoclip migration, future product development and applications, equipment prototypes, enhanced recovery after surgery, dental navigation-guided surgery, and gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures also were excluded.</p></div>
