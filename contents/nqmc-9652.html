Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age two years and older undergoing elective non-high-risk surgery having laboratory tests/imaging unrelated to positive findings on preoperative basic health assessment.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age two years and older with complete preoperative basic health assessment obtained prior to undergoing elective, non-high-risk surgery and no diagnostic tests performed without clinical indications.</p>
<p>Preoperative assessment is expected before all surgical procedures. This assessment includes an appropriately directed and sufficiently comprehensive history and physical examination, and in some cases, properly includes laboratory and other testing to help direct management and assess surgical risk. However, preoperative testing for low-risk surgical procedures (such as cataract extraction) results in unnecessary delays and adds to significant avoidable costs and should be eliminated.</p>
<p>Roizen et al. have said that "history-taking and the physical examination are still the best means of preoperative screening, and laboratory tests other than those indicated by the history and physical examination are not cost effective, do not provide medicolegal protection, and in fact may harm the patient" (1987).</p>
<p>Meneghini et al. in reviewing charts of children classified as physical status 1 and 2 (using the American Society of Anesthesiologists Classification System) who underwent minor surgical procedures have said that "on the basis of our experience we believe that a thorough clinical assessment of the patient is more important than routine preoperative laboratory screening, which should be required only when justified by real clinical indications. Moreover, this practice eliminates unnecessary costs without compromising the safety and the quality of care" (1998).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) has long had a policy of transparency in declaring potential conflicting and competing interests of all individuals who participate in the development, revision and approval of ICSI guidelines and protocols. </p>
<p>In 2010, the ICSI Conflict of Interest Review Committee was established by the Board of Directors to review all disclosures and make recommendations to the board when steps should be taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, including recommendations regarding removal of work group members.
