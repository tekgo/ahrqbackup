<h2>Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong></p>
<p>Published guidelines should be consulted regarding the appropriateness of genetic testing, and a more tailored approach to medical management should be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation of families for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome should include consideration of other hereditary syndromes in which breast and ovarian cancers are component cancers.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong></p>
<p>Standards of care for accurate risk assessment should be followed when identifying individuals at risk for breast and/or ovarian cancers. Consider established models and published data to estimate the individual's risk of developing cancer, as this will assist in determining appropriate management as summarized in Recommendation 4 (below).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong></p>
<p>Clients should be given management recommendations based on clinical judgment, complemented by risk assessment, family history, and genetic test results (when appropriate).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong></p>
<p>The genetics consultation should include the provision of extensive client resources including scientific information, psychosocial support, and advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong></p>
<p>Clients should be engaged in a discussion of the ethical, legal, and social implications of genetic information and testing.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>The process of cancer risk assessment and genetic counseling for HBOC syndrome requires many steps, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Gathering personal medical and family history data </li>
    <li>Psychosocial assessment </li>
    <li>Discussion of cancer and mutation risk and how personalized risk estimates are derived </li>
    <li>Facilitation of the informed consent process through discussion of the risks, benefits, limitations, and likelihood of identifying a mutation with genetic susceptibility testing </li>
    <li>Results disclosure (if applicable) </li>
    <li>Discussion of medical management options </li>
    <li>Review of issues related to genetic discrimination </li>
</ol>
<p>Genetics professionals are uniquely suited to facilitating clients' understanding of the genetics of cancer, personalized risk calculations, and the potential psychological, social, and medical implications associated with cancer risk assessment and genetic testing. Genetics professionals are also adept at identifying clients who may need additional support, and providing a referral to appropriate mental health care professionals. The above guidelines provide a best practices approach to offering a more uniform manner of delivering comprehensive care for families and individuals facing HBOC syndrome.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate use of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer </li>
    <li>The guidelines provide a best practices approach to offering a more uniform manner of delivering comprehensive care for families and individuals facing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Risk assessment for cancer can raise a number of intellectual and psychosocial issues.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Clients need to contend with an enhanced understanding of their specific cancer risks, potentially difficult decisions for managing their cancer risks, concerns about discrimination, and worry about possible risks and reactions in their children and other family members. </li>
        <li>BRCA mutation carriers face some difficult reproductive choices regarding the use of oral contraceptives, tubal ligation, risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), pregnancy, and breastfeeding. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>As with all genetic testing, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome testing has the potential to raise ethical, legal and social issues, both within the family and for society as a whole. Additionally, patients may express concern about the potential for genetic discrimination, particularly with regard to health and life insurance in the event of a positive test result. The fear of discrimination may prevent at-risk individuals from having genetic testing, which in turn could have significant health implications. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The practice guidelines of the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) are developed by members of the NSGC to assist genetic counselors and other health care providers in making decisions about appropriate management of genetic concerns, including access to and/or delivery of services. Each practice guideline focuses on a clinical or practice-based issue, and is the result of a review and analysis of current professional literature believed to be reliable. As such, information and recommendations within the NSGC practice guidelines reflect the current scientific and clinical knowledge at the time of publication, are only current as of their publication date, and are subject to change without notice as advances emerge. </li>
    <li>In addition, variations in practice, which take into account the needs of the individual patient and the resources and limitations unique to the institution or type of practice, may warrant approaches, treatments and/or procedures that differ from the recommendations outlined in this guideline. Therefore, these recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. Genetic counseling practice guidelines are never intended to displace a health care provider's best medical judgment based on the clinical circumstances of a particular patient or patient population. Practice guidelines are published by NSGC for educational and informational purposes only, and NSGC does not "approve" or "endorse" any specific methods, practices, or sources of information. </li>
