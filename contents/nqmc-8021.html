Description

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of patients five years and older who have appropriate treatment and management of asthma in inpatient care settings.</p>
<p>Asthma remains the number one chronic disease of childhood with 12.8 million school days missed. The toll of asthma includes 1.7 million emergency department visits, 10.6 million physician office visits, 444,000 hospitalizations and 3,613 deaths.</p>
<p>The United States has seen declining asthma death rates despite increased prevalence. Fewer patients who have asthma report limitation to activities. Twenty-three million Americans, one out of every 13 people, have this chronic inflammatory lung disease that if uncontrolled can lead to suffering with cough, wheezing and shortness of breath. Approximately 50% of asthma patients report having had an attack within one year, and they suffer a larger volume of missed school and work. Of all asthma patients, more than 13% suffer asthma attacks that require urgent medical care. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified its priority to be patients improving management of asthma symptoms.</p></div>
