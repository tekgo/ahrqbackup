Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of a facility's end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients aged 18 years and older with medical record documentation of a discussion of renal replacement therapy modalities (including hemodialysis [HD], peritoneal dialysis [PD], home HD, transplants and identification of potential living donors, and no/cessation of renal replacement therapy) at least once during the 12-month reporting period.</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Shared decision making is the recognized preferred model for medical decision making because it addresses the ethical need to fully inform patients about the risks and benefits of treatments and ensures that patients' values and preferences are considered. It is based on a common understanding of the goals of treatment and the risks and benefits of the chosen course compared with any reasonable alternative. However, observational evidence indicates that shared decision making, especially the legal requirements for full disclosure and informed decisions, is often not achieved in the dialysis setting. Many patients initiating dialysis receive or perceive inadequate information and may not understand the information they do receive, despite the fact that the diagnosis of progressive renal disease is known well before the actual need for dialysis arises.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure
</h2>
<div class='field field_picklist-choice'>
<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A clinical practice guideline or other peer-reviewed synthesis of the clinical research evidence
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences
</div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In 2008, the adjusted incident rate of end stage renal disease (ESRD) cases in the United States (U.S.) was 350.8 per million population, and the adjusted rate of prevalent cases rose 1.9 percent to 1,699 per million population. This rate is nearly 20 percent greater than that seen in 2000, and the annual rate of increase has remained between 1.9 and 2.3 percent since 2003. </li>
    <li>The disease burden of ESRD disproportionately affects minority populations, in particular African American and Latino populations. The rate of ESRD in minority patients ranges from 1.5 to 4 times those of age-adjusted Caucasian patients. </li>
    <li>Kidney disease is a major cause of morbidity and is the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. Nearly 85,000 Americans die with kidney failure each year, with adjusted rates of all-cause mortality 6.4 to 7.8 times higher for dialysis patients than for individuals in the general population. The mortality rate is highest within the first six months of initiating dialysis at approximately 30 percent. The rate then declines over the next six months before increasing gradually again over the next four years. </li>
    <li>Resource utilization by ESRD patients is substantial. For instance, in 2008 nearly 92% of the 112,476 incident U.S. ESRD patients were being treated via hemodialysis. Of these, 98.5% were being dialyzed three or more times per week at three or more hours per session. Additionally, the risk of hospitalization is 1.25 times greater in ESRD patients than in patients without, and adjusted hospital admission rates for dialysis patients have fallen only 1.5 percent since 1993. </li>
    <li>Total Medicare costs rose nearly 11 percent in 2008&mdash;up from a 7 percent rise the previous year&mdash;to $454 billion. ESRD costs rose 13.2 percent to $26.8 billion, and accounted for 5.9 percent of the Medicare budget. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Testing Protocol</strong><br />
The Kidney Care Quality Alliance (KCQA) tested its end stage renal disease (ESRD) measures through a prospective cohort study on a nationally drawn sample of 53 dialysis facilities containing a mix of for-profit and not-for-profit providers; hospital-affiliated and freestanding facilities within large, small, and independent dialysis organizations; urban, suburban, and rural settings; and facilities both with and without electronic health records (EHRs). Approximately 25 patients per facility were sought, resulting in a final sample size of 1,115 patients. Both facility and patient samples were structured to be generally representative of the national industry profile as identified by the United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) 2007 Annual Data Report. Facility records were used as the data source, and standardized, paper-based data collection sheets constructed from the endorsed specifications were employed during data collection (see also the "Companion Documents" field for the data collection form). </p>
<p>Following the year-long data collection period, on-site data-integrity audits were performed at 11 of the 53 facilities (21%). Audit sites were selected to provide a cross-section of facilities reflective of the sample profile. Selection criteria included geographic location, facility type (e.g., for-profit vs. not-for-profit, urban vs. rural), and EHR use. Pertinent data were reabstracted from the patients' medical records and were compared to the information submitted by the facility throughout the pilot to assess the measure's reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Results</strong><br />
<em>Performance</em>: Patient education data were provided for all 1,115 patients in the study sample. The performance rate for the measure was calculated as follows: </p>
<p><strong>Performance Rate</strong> =</p>
<p class="Center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(Pts educated on all modalities* - Pts educated but without documentation)</span><br />
Total ESRD Pts Aged &ge; 18 Years</p>
<p class="Center">= (185 - 2) / 1,115 = <strong>16.4%</strong></p>
<p>Performance for each individual facility ranged from 0% to 100%, demonstrating a performance gap.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Reliability</em>: Inter-rater reliability and the reliability percentage were assessed during on-site data integrity audits through a direct comparison of data submitted by the facilities throughout the pilot to data reabstracted by the auditor(s). Results were quantitatively summarized using Cohen's Kappa with confidence intervals and were provided to the National Quality Forum, which then converted the measure from time-limited to full endorsement. Results indicated that the measure can be reliability collected, but it was recognized that clarification in the instructions as to what constitutes patient education on end-of-life care as defined by the measure was needed. </p>
<p class="Note">*Patient must be educated on all renal replacement modalities to receive credit for the measure.</p></div>
