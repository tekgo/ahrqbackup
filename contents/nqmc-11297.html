<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level 30-day risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) for patients discharged from the hospital with either a principal discharge diagnosis of pneumonia or a principle discharge diagnosis of sepsis with a secondary discharge diagnosis of pneumonia. The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission. A specified set of planned readmissions do not count as readmissions. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Readmission of patients who were recently discharged after hospitalization with pneumonia represents an important, expensive, and often preventable adverse outcome. The risk of readmission can be modified by the quality and type of care provided to these patients. Improving readmission rates is the joint responsibility of hospitals and clinicians. Measuring readmission will create incentives to invest in interventions to improve hospital care, better assess the readiness of patients for discharge, and facilitate transitions to outpatient status.</p></div>

Denominator Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The measure cohort consists of admissions for Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries aged 65 years and older and discharged from non-federal acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals, having a principal discharge diagnosis of pneumonia (including aspiration pneumonia) or a principal discharge diagnosis of sepsis (not including severe sepsis) that have a secondary discharge diagnosis of pneumonia (including aspiration pneumonia) coded as present on admission (POA) and no secondary diagnosis of severe sepsis coded as POA.</p>
<p>The risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions at a given hospital, multiplied by the national observed readmission rate. For each hospital, the denominator is the number of readmissions expected based on the nation's performance with that hospital's case-mix.</p>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 2007, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) (2007) called for hospital-specific public reporting of readmission rates, and identified pneumonia as a priority condition. In 2010, pneumonia is the principal discharge diagnosis for more than 1 million hospitalizations each year in the United States (Lindenauer et al., 2012; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017). From 2003 to 2004, approximately 20% of pneumonia patients were rehospitalized within thirty days, representing the second-highest proportion of all rehospitalizations at 6.3% (Jencks et al., 2009). Among patients 65 years [of age] or older in the United States, pneumonia is the second leading cause of hospitalization (Fry et al., 2005), and based on 2005 Medicare data, MedPAC estimated that about 8.9% of Medicare pneumonia admissions were followed by a readmission within 15 days, accounting for more than 74,000 admissions at a cost of $533 million. </p>
<p>Pneumonia readmission is a costly event and represents an undesirable outcome of care from the patient's perspective, and highly disparate pneumonia readmission rates among hospitals suggest there is room for improvement (MedPAC, 2007; Lindenauer et al., 2010). Although many current hospital interventions are known to decrease the risk of readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge (Leppin et al., 2014), current process-based performance measures, cannot capture all the ways that care within the hospital might influence outcomes. Measurement of patient outcomes allows for a comprehensive view of quality of care that reflects complex aspects of care such as communication between providers and coordinated transitions to the outpatient environment. These aspects are critical to patient outcomes, and are more broad than what can be captured by individual process-of-care measures.</p>
<p>The pneumonia hospital-specific risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) measure is thus intended to inform quality-of-care improvement efforts, as individual process-based performance measures cannot encompass all the complex and critical aspects of care within a hospital that contribute to patient outcomes. As a result, many stakeholders, including patient organizations, are interested in outcomes measures that allow patients and providers to assess relative outcomes performance for hospitals (Bratzler, Nsa, &amp; Houck, 2007).</p>
<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that appropriate (guideline recommended care), high-quality and timely treatment for pneumonia patients can reduce the risk of readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge (Leppin et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2011). Recent evidence of declining readmission rates provides further support for the concept that care processes during and following hospitalization can affect a patient's risk of readmission (Lee et al., 2014). </p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models</strong></p>
<p>The pneumonia readmission measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year.</p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero.</p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.5 of the original measure documentation. </p>
<p><strong>Pneumonia Readmission 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of Pneumonia Model Variables</em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Increases in Asthma (11.2% to 14.5%), Respiratory arrest; cardio-respiratory failure and shock (25.7% to 28.0%), Other psychiatric disorders (24.0% to 26.5%), and Septicemia, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome/shock (13.9% to 16.2%) </li>
    <li>A decrease in Iron deficiency or other/unspecified anemias and blood disease (60.7% to 58.5%) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Pneumonia Model Parameters and Performance</em></p>
<p>Table 4.5.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.5.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the pneumonia readmission model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic increased slightly from 0.63 to 0.64.</p>

<p>If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, only the first is considered a readmission. The measures assess a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has any unplanned readmission within 30 days. If the first readmission after discharge is planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not considered in the outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.</p>
<p>The risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions at a given hospital, multiplied by the national observed readmission rate. For each hospital, the numerator of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted based on the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.</p>
<p class="Note">See the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;cid=1219069855841" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 Condition-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures</a></em> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Admissions identified as planned by the planned readmissions algorithm are not counted as readmissions. The planned readmission algorithm is a set of criteria for classifying readmissions and planned among the general Medicare population using Medicare administrative claims data. The algorithm identified admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. </p>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm has three fundamental principles: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>
    <li>Otherwise, a planned readmission is defined as a non-acute readmission for a scheduled procedure; and </li>
    <li>Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned </li>
</ol>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm uses a flow chart and four tables of specific procedure categories and discharge diagnosis categories to classify readmissions as planned. The flow chart and tables are available in the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;cid=1219069855841" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 Condition-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures</a></em>.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measures to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) readmission rates are higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission.</p></div>
