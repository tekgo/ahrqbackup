<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Exclusive breast milk feeding (BF) for the first 6 months of neonatal life has long been the expressed goal of World Health Organization (WHO), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). ACOG (2007) has recently reiterated its position. A recent Cochrane review substantiates the benefits (Kramer &amp; Kakuma, 2002). Much evidence has now focused on the prenatal and intrapartum period as critical for the success of exclusive (or any) BF (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2007; Petrova, Hegyi, &amp; Mehta, 2007; Shealy et al., 2005; Taveras et al., 2004). Exclusive breast milk feeding rate during birth hospital stay has been calculated by the California Department of Public Health for the last several years using newborn genetic disease testing data. Healthy People 2010 and the CDC have also been active in promoting this goal.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Breastfeeding is associated with decreased risk for many early-life diseases and conditions, including otitis media, respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, gastroenteritis, type 2 diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome, and obesity. Breastfeeding also is associated with health benefits to women, including decreased risk for type 2 diabetes, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer (Ip et al., 2007). Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as a newborn receiving only breast milk and no other liquids or solids except for drops or syrups consisting of vitamins, minerals, or medicines (World Health Organization [WHO], 1991). </li>
    <li>In 2007, Healthy People 2010 objectives for breastfeeding initiation and duration included two new objectives on exclusive breastfeeding to increase the proportion of mothers who exclusively breastfeed their infants through age 3 months to 60% and through age 6 months to 25% [objectives 16-19d and 16-19e] (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2000). The Healthy People 2020 objectives for exclusive breastfeeding were continued through age 3 months with a goal of 46.2% and age 6 months with a goal of 25.5% [objectives MICH-21.4 and MICH-21.5]. Also included is the related objective MICH-24: increase the proportion of live births that occur in facilities that provide recommended care for lactating mothers and their babies (DHHS, 2010). </li>
    <li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a Guide to Breastfeeding Interventions in 2005 for the promotion and support of breastfeeding based on detailed input from the spectrum of breastfeeding experts which can be used to help hospitals achieve the Healthy People 2020 objective MICH-24. Institutional changes, i.e., attaining Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative status, individual interventions including increased rooming-in of mothers and newborns, early skin to skin contact and discontinuing policies that are not evidence based have been shown to increase breastfeeding initiation and duration rates as well (Shealy et al., 2005). According to the CDC (2011), mothers who want to breastfeed who do not receive hospital support will stop early. The CDC encourages hospitals to partner with Baby-Friendly hospitals to learn how to improve maternity care, use the CDC's Maternity Practice in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) survey data to prioritize changes to improve maternity care practices and stop distributing formula samples and give-aways to breastfeeding mothers. </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Twenty-six contracted performance measurement systems (PMS) agreed to support the perinatal care measures. Joint Commission staff defined and developed a database structure for electronic receipt of measure data and a verification process was implemented to assure that measures were embedded into the measurement system's technical infrastructures and into their data collection tools in accord with Joint Commission specifications. Joint Commission staff also verified data collection tools and provided education regarding the performance measure set to PMS vendors, who in turn provided education and ongoing support to their contracted hospitals. </p>
<p>Once sufficient data to support this effort were received by The Joint Commission, a reliability assessment of the measures and individual data elements was conducted from October 2011 through January 2012. A data collection tool was developed to facilitate the reabstraction of selected medical records and assessment of the reliability of the data elements. Reliability test site visits were conducted by Joint Commission staff at a subset of 12 randomly-selected hospitals. Selection of the sites was based on multiple characteristics, including hospital demographics, bed size and type of facility. </p>
<p>In the course of the reliability site visits, electronic and paper medical records were blindly reabstracted by Joint Commission staff. Reabstracted data elements were then compared with the hospital's originally abstracted data on a data element to data element basis. Differences in abstraction were investigated and adjudicated in order to understand the reasons for any disparities. In addition, structured focus group discussions were held at each site to gather additional feedback on the measures. A resource evaluation was also completed the site visit hospitals to assess the cost and time associated with data collection effort. Feedback from the focus group discussions has been incorporated into the measure </p></div>
