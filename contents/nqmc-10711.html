<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This is a very important measure of quality of care in all inpatient care facilities including the nursing homes, inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), and long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) that serve patients at-risk of influenza owing to existing medical co-morbidities. Although influenza is prevalent among all population groups, the rates of death and serious complications related to influenza are highest among those age 65 or older and those with medical complications that put them at higher risk. Frail elderly are especially vulnerable and subject to complications of influenza. Morbidity and mortality related to influenza are often reported in conjunction with data related to pneumonia and these conditions frequently lead to death in the elderly population.</p>
<p>Using data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Gorina and colleagues (2008) found that, in 2004, pneumonia and influenza jointly represented the seventh-most common cause of death for persons age 65 or older in the United States. In 2004, almost 60,000 deaths were caused by influenza and pneumonia, and more than 85% of those were among the elderly (Gorina et al., 2008). Additionally, the death rate from influenza and pneumonia is nearly 130 times higher among persons aged 85 or older compared to individuals 45 to 54 years of age (Gorina et al., 2008). In the same year approximately 123,000 death certificates identified influenza and pneumonia as a secondary cause of death (Gorina et al., 2008). Furthermore, in the same year, the average hospital stay for the more than 200,000 influenza-related hospitalization cases was approximately 5.3 days at a cost of $6,900 per stay (Milenkovic, Russo, &amp; Elixhauser, 2006).</p>
<p>Influenza and pneumonia are now reported as the fifth-leading cause of death among persons age 65 or older in the United States (Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services [CMS], 2011). As of 2011, there are over 200,000 hospitalizations from influenza, on average, every year (CMS, 2011). An average of 36,000 Americans die annually due to influenza and its complications and most are people 65 years of age and over (CMS, 2011). Vaccination of residents in nursing homes and patients in IRFs and LTCHs against influenza is an important mechanism to reduce serious illness and mortality in these patient care facilities. Given that many individuals receiving health care services in these post-acute care settings are elderly and/or have medical conditions, they are within the target population for influenza vaccination (Zorowitz, 2010). Among adults age 65 years or older, only 72.1% were vaccinated during the 2006&ndash;2007 influenza season (CDC, 2008), and only 69.6% of adults age 65 or older were vaccinated in the 2009&ndash;2010 season (CDC, 2011)&mdash;rates well below the Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020 target of 90% for this age group (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], 2000; ODPHP, 2011).</p>
<p>CMS currently uses MDS 2.0 data to publicly report an influenza vaccination quality measure (QM) for nursing home residents. The first quarter (Q1) 2007 statewide average vaccination rates for the post-acute care population ranged from 56.9% to 85.4%, with a 73.2% national average (Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, 2007). According to the information currently available on the Nursing Home Compare Web site, the national average for the percentage of short-stay residents given the influenza vaccine has increased to 82% (CMS, n.d.).</p>
<p>This measure is intended to encourage nursing homes, IRFs and LTCHs to focus on this important aspect of clinical care by assessing residents or patients on their seasonal influenza immunization status and providing immunization, as deemed clinically appropriate.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>According to the environmental scan conducted by the Colorado Foundation for Medical Care (2007), several expert organizations, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Fiore et al., 2010), target influenza prevention through annual vaccination of post-acute care facility residents or patients and staff. Influenza vaccine can be cost-effective and successful in preventing influenza. However, despite evidence demonstrating the efficacy of the influenza vaccine, coverage remains low among residents (Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, 2007). A study conducted in 2002 by Nichol and Goodman found that vaccination of healthy elderly adults was associated with a 36% reduction in hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2% to 39%), an 18% reduction in hospitalization for all respiratory conditions (95% CI: -6% to 37%), and a 40% reduction in death (95% CI: 14% to 38%). Vaccination was also associated with cost savings in all scenarios evaluated (Nichol &amp; Goodman, 2002). Influenza vaccination is recommended for those over the age of 65 and those with medical conditions, which describes the population of all post-acute care facilities, making it an appropriate quality measure with the potential to reduce the number of infections and their associated healthcare costs (Fiore et al., 2010). </li>
    <li>There is a demonstrated gap in vaccination among adults age 65 years or older. Although the influenza vaccine can be successful in preventing the flu, vaccination rates remain low among nursing home residents (Gorina et al., 2008; CDC, 2008), owing, in part, to patient confusion, poor documentation of vaccination status by health care providers, and limited availability of records from previous facilities (Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, 2007). According to the CDC, among adults age 65 years or older, only 72.1% were vaccinated during the 2006&ndash;2007 influenza season (CDC, 2008), and only 69.6% were vaccinated in the 2009&ndash;2010 season (CDC, 2011)&mdash;both much lower figures than the Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020 target of 90% for this age group (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], 2000; ODPHP, 2011).
    <p>A study of the implementation of a pneumococcal vaccination standing order on an inpatient hospital serving geriatric patients found that after implementing the order, the vaccination rate increased from 0% to 15.4%, and vaccination opportunity rate increased from 8% to 59.1% (Eckrode, Church, &amp; English, 2007). This indicates that there is a wide range of performance among facilities that are measuring vaccination rates and those that are not. In its analysis of quality measures using Minimum Data Set (MDS) data from the first quarter of 2006, the University of Colorado found that this measure could be reported for 75.7% of facilities and had variability across facilities in the rates of influenza immunization. The quality measure varied from 35.7% at the 10th percentile to 98.1% at the 90th percentile (Brega et al., 2008). </p>
    <p>While no studies have been conducted specific to inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) and long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), the similarities between the patient populations in LTCHs and IRFs and the population in health care settings, such as nursing homes (which have been studied) indicate that the measure is applicable in LTCH and IRF settings and the opportunity for improvement exists in LTCHs and IRFs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>A study that examined racial disparities in receipt and documentation of influenza vaccinations among nursing home residents concluded that racial disparities exist in vaccination coverage among United States (U.S.) nursing home residents (Li &amp; Mukamel, 2010).
    <p>Racial segregation among nursing facilities has been shown to be a major factor driving racial disparities in the nursing home population, primarily for African Americans. In 2000, a study drawing on national MDS and Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) data found that two-thirds of all black residents were living in just 10% of all facilities (Smith et al., 2007). A 2002 survey of a stratified sample of 39 nursing facilities and 181 residential care/assisted living facilities in four states had similar findings (Howard et al., 2002). Facilities serving African Americans have demonstrated a lower level of quality care than those serving whites, with lower staff to resident ratios and higher deficiency ratings (Grabowski, 2007). Minority groups in general, and African Americans in particular, have also had more limited access to nursing facility care than whites (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], CDC, 1997). A search of PubMed did not reveal any recently published research studies related to racial and ethnic disparities for influenza immunization in post-acute care facilities; however, differences in influenza vaccination between whites and non-white Medicare beneficiaries and Medicare beneficiaries in general have been documented. Therefore, these differences are likely found in IRFs and LTCHs as well (Flowers, Sinclair, &amp; Figueiredo, 2008). Among adults age 18 or older, there are higher rates of seasonal influenza vaccinations in rural areas (53.7%) compared with urban areas (47.1%), but there is no published information specific to the elderly or to nursing home residents (NCHS, CDC, 2009). </p>
    <p>Bardenheier and colleagues (2004) conducted a study to identify nursing facility resident-specific characteristics associated with vaccination coverage and at baseline. Results of bivariate analysis showed that residents with cognitive, psychiatric, or neurologic problems were more likely to be vaccinated than those without these conditions. Results of the multilevel analysis also showed that the presence of cognitive deficits was one of the strongest resident characteristics associated with receipt of immunizations, controlling facility variation (Bardenheier et al., 2004). </p>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A joint RAND/Harvard team engaged in a deliberate iterative process to incorporate provider and consumer input, expert consultation, scientific advances in clinical knowledge about screening and assessment, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) experience, and intensive item development and testing by a national Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) consortium. This process allowed the final national testing of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 to include well-developed and tested items.</p>
<p>The national validation and evaluation of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (NHs) (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA NHs (764 residents), regionally distributed throughout the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze inter-rater agreement (reliability) between gold-standard (research) nurses and between facility and gold-standard nurses, validity of key sections, response rates for interview items, anonymous feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment.</p>
<p>Analysis of the test results showed that MDS 3.0 items had either excellent or very good reliability even when comparing research nurse to facility-nurse assessment. In most instances these were higher than those seen in the past with MDS 2.0. In addition, for the cognitive, mood and behavior items, national testing included collection of independent criterion or gold-standard measures. These MDS 3.0 sections were more highly matched to criterion measures than were MDS 2.0 items.</p>
<p>Improvements incorporated in MDS 3.0 produced a more efficient assessment: better quality information was obtained in less time. Such gains should improve identification of resident needs and enhance resident-focused care planning. In addition, including items recognized in other care settings is likely to enhance communication among providers. These significant gains reflect the cumulative effect of changes across the tool, including use of more valid items, direct inclusion of resident reports, improved clarity of retained items, deletion of poorly performing items, form redesign, and briefer assessment periods for clinical items.</p>
