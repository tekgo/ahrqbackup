<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Episiotomy is an obstetric practice employed during childbirth in which the vaginal opening is enlarged by a surgical cut to the perineum with scissors or scalpel (Carroli &amp; Mignini, 2009). Historically, episiotomy has been performed prophylactically to prevent severe vaginal tears and to facilitate an easier/faster birth of the baby (Carroli &amp; Mignini, 2009; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], 2006). Other suggested maternal benefits include the preservation of muscle relaxation of the pelvic floor leading to improved sexual function, reduced risk of faecal and/or urinary incontinence, and improved surgical healing (i.e., subsequent to a clean surgical incision and repair, rather than a potential 3rd or 4th degree laceration). For the neonate, it is suggested that a faster birth may be protective against the risks of a prolonged second stage of labour (greater than 120 mins), which may lead to fetal asphyxia, cranial trauma, cerebral haemorrhage and mental retardation (Carroli &amp; Mignini, 2009). Alternatively however, hypothesized adverse risks may include extensions of the episiotomy to 3rd or 4th degree tears, unsatisfactory anatomic results (e.g., skin tags, vaginal prolapse, recto-vaginal fistula), increased blood loss and haematoma, pain and edema of the episiotomy region, infection, sexual dysfunction, anal sphincter dysfunction, and dyspareunia (Carroli &amp; Mignini, 2009; ACOG, 2006). </p>
<p>What is interesting about episiotomy is how the procedure became routine despite limited to no data supporting its effectiveness. Although it has been cited in the literature for more than 300 years, the practice was not widely employed until the mid-20th century when there was an increased focus to have women give birth in the hospital and greater medical involvement in the birthing process (Carroli &amp; Mignini, 2009; ACOG, 2006). Although knowledge surrounding the benefits and harms of episiotomy has grown substantially since then, rates of episiotomy remain highly variable (e.g., 9.7% in Sweden vs. 100% in Taiwan) (Carroli &amp; Mignini, 2009). In Ontario, the rate of episiotomy ranges from 7% to 31% (Dunn et al., 2011). Given such wide practice variations, it has been suggested that the primary drivers of episiotomy use relate more to regional and individual circumstances (local professional norms, experiences in training, and individual provider preference) than specific variation in the physiology of vaginal birth (Viswanathan et al., 2005).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Episiotomy represents a unique obstetrical practice in that it became a part of accoucheurs' repertoire of interventions based on its theoretical value rather than any demonstrated worth, and has remained a conventional practice (more or less) despite strong empirical evidence disfavoring its use. </li>
    <li>Two systematic reviews based on thousands of women evaluated in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have unequivocally determined the practice of restrictive episiotomy during vaginal birth to be better than routine episiotomy with respect to numerous maternal outcomes. </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to support the practice of episiotomy for improving neonatal outcomes. </li>
    <li>When episiotomy is 'indicated' there is insufficient evidence to know the relative value of midline vs. mediolateral types of incisions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <em>What are the Maternal and Newborn Outcomes Associated with Episiotomy During Spontaneous Vaginal Birth?</em> for a summary of evidence around the risks and benefits to mothers and newborns subsequent to practice of episiotomy during spontaneous vaginal birth. The report's intention is to support a quality improvement initiative that seeks to reduce rates of episiotomy among women who having a spontaneous vaginal birth in Ontario.</p>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>To validate the seven potential indicators as being appropriate for use throughout the province, the authors first extracted data from the BORN Information System (BIS) for fiscal year 2009 to 2010 to assess historical and current performance on these indicators across Ontario's 14 health regions (Local Health Integration Networks). Simultaneously, evidence summaries on each of the potential indicators were developed in collaboration with the Knowledge to Action Research Centre at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Thielman et al., 2011; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What are the drivers," 2010; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What are the maternal," 2011; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What is known," 2011; Khangura, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, 2010). This group, which has expertise in the review and synthesis of literature to support evidence-informed health care decision-making, assisted with determining the level of scientific evidence to support each indicator. For example, the evidence summary on early term repeat Caesarean section (i.e., before 39 weeks' gestation) in a defined population determined that as a result of this practice there were indeed objective risks to babies that could be reduced by delaying delivery.</p>
<p>Following review of the data and evidence summaries, the committee removed one indicator and refined some of the others, leaving six. In five of the six, the potential for improvement in rates was obvious. The remaining indicator (rate of screening for group B streptococcus) is currently satisfactory throughout all health regions of the province; however, the committee felt it was important at the outset to have the dashboard reflect not only performance areas requiring improvement, but also areas in which performance was good.</p></div>
