<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team's project coordinator searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines and other relevant content published between 2006 and 2014. This list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites, recommendations from the literature, and key Web sites related to pressure ulcers/injuries. Furthermore, expert panel members were asked to provide guidelines from their own personal libraries. The full search strategy is available at the <a href="http://rnao.ca/sites/rnao-ca/files/Systematic_Review_Search_Strategy.pdf" title="RNAO Web site">RNAO Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search strategy was developed by RNAO's research team and a health sciences librarian, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. A search for relevant articles published in English between January 2006 and October 2014 was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), EMBASE, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, and PsycINFO. In addition to this systematic search, panel members were asked to review personal libraries for key articles not found through the above search strategies.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms, is available in the guideline search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Once articles were retrieved, two RNAO Best Practice Guideline (BPG) nursing research associates (nurses holding master's degrees) independently assessed the eligibility of the studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The RNAO's BPG program manager, involved in supporting the RNAO expert panel, resolved disagreements.</p>
<p>Prior to publication, the systematic review was updated, and a search for relevant articles published in English between October 2014 and December 31, 2015 was applied to the following databases: Medline, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and CDSR. The purpose of this systematic review update was to capture any relevant research that would prompt an update to the current recommendations. A total of 2,042 research articles were retrieved, and one RNAO BPG nursing research associate assessed the eligibility of the studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. Any uncertainties were resolved by the RNAO's Best Practice Guideline program manager. In total, six research articles were included in the systematic review update.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Search</strong></p>
<p>RNAO expert panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify key articles not found through the above search strategies. Articles identified by RNAO expert panel members were included in search results if two nursing research associates independently determined that the articles had not been identified by the systematic review search and met the inclusion criteria.</p></div>

<p>Two of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario's (RNAO) Best Practice Guideline (BPG) nursing research associates and a BPG program manager critically appraised 16 international guidelines using the <em>Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument 2</em> (Brouwers et al., 2010).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Quality appraisal scores for 16 articles (a random sample of 10 percent of articles eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by RNAO BPG research associates. Acceptable inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic, K=0.706) justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction by dividing the remaining studies equally between the two research associates. A final summary of literature findings was completed. The comprehensive data tables and summary were provided to all expert panel members for review and discussion.</p>
<p>A review of the most recent literature and relevant guidelines published between January 2006 and October 2014 resulted in an update of the existing recommendations as well as the inclusion of new recommendations.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>For this revised guideline, Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas (see the "Composition of the Group That Authored the Guideline" field). A systematic review of the evidence was based on the purpose and scope of the original guideline, Assessment and Management of Stage I to IV Pressure Ulcers (RNAO, 2007), and was supported by four clinical questions. The systematic review captured relevant literature and guidelines published between January 2006 and October 2014. The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What are the most effective methods for the assessment of existing pressure ulcers/injuries in clients? </li>
    <li>What are the most effective interventions to manage existing pressure ulcers/injuries in clients? </li>
    <li>What education and training is required to ensure the provision of effective pressure ulcer/injury assessment and management among practicing health care professionals? </li>
    <li>How do health-care organizations and the broader health-care system support and promote the optimal assessment and management of existing pressure ulcers/injuries in clients? </li>
</ol>
<p>The expert panel's mandate was to review the original guideline in light of the new evidence to ensure the continuing validity, appropriateness, and safety of the recommendations. This new revised guideline is the result of the expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence into the recommendations with the supporting evidence from the original guideline (where applicable).</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Stakeholder reviewers for Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) Best Practice Guideline (BPGs) are identified in two ways. First, stakeholders are recruited through a public call issued on the RNAO Web site (<a href="http://RNAO.ca/bpg/get-involved/stakeholder" title="RNAO Web site">http://RNAO.ca/bpg/get-involved/stakeholder</a>). Second, key individuals and organizations with expertise in the Guideline topic area are identified by the RNAO guideline development team and expert panel, and are invited to participate in the review.</p>
<p>Reviewers are asked to read a full draft of the Guideline and participate in the review prior to its publication. Stakeholder feedback is submitted by completing an online survey questionnaire. Stakeholders are asked to answer the following questions with regard to each recommendation:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Is this recommendation clear? </li>
    <li>Do you agree with this recommendation? </li>
    <li>Does the evidence support this recommendation? </li>
    <li>Does this recommendation apply to all roles, regions, and practice settings? </li>
</ul>
<p>The survey also includes an opportunity for stakeholders to include comments and feedback related to each section of the guideline.</p>
<p>The RNAO guideline development team compiles the survey submissions and prepares a summary of the feedback received. The RNAO expert panel reviews and considers all feedback and, if necessary, modifies the guideline content and recommendations prior to publication, in order to address the feedback received.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>According to a systematic review, therapeutic relationships instill hope in people with pressure injuries, improve their adherence to treatment, and ultimately contribute to positive health outcomes. </li>
    <li>In several studies, a specialized diet resulted in improved wound healing (e.g., reduction in pressure injury size and higher rates of healing), decreased wound care requirements, and improved tissue viability in some people with stage 2, 3, and 4 pressure injuries. </li>
    <li>A retrospective study conducted on 85 patients with deep tissue pressure injuries (DTPIs) found a significant improvement in wound severity scores when non-contact ultrasound was delivered via a fine mist to the suspected DTPIs. </li>
    <li>Adequate pain control improves all aspects of a person's quality of life, including mood (e.g., stress, anxiety anger), sleep, cognition, ability to cope, and ability to perform the activities of daily living. </li>
    <li>Electrical stimulation speeds up healing and promotes wound closure in stalled but healable stage 2, 3, and 4 pressure injuries.</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Hydrogen peroxide can harm healthy granulation tissue and may form air emboli if packed in deep sinuses. </li>
    <li>Mercuric chloride, crystal violet, and Proflavine may be mutagens and can have systemic toxicity. </li>
    <li>Cetrimide (quaternary ammonium) poses the risk of high toxicity to tissue. </li>
    <li>Povidone iodine is toxic with prolonged use or over large areas. </li>
    <li>The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP), European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP), &amp; Pan-Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance (PPPIA) and Australian Wound Management Association (AWMA) guideline groups do not recommend that silver dressings be used for a prolonged period of time, because of the potential for tissue toxicity and the risk of bacterial resistance. Thus, silver dressings should be discontinued once superficial critical colonization is no longer a clinical concern, as demonstrated by decreased exudates, decreased odour, improved wound measurements, and improvement in the peri-wound. </li>

Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Electromagnetic therapy (EMT) is contraindicated in people with electrical device implants (e.g., pacemakers), people who have undergone an organ transplant, and women who are pregnant. Other contraindications to pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) use include active bleeding, active deep vein thrombosis, and suspected or confirmed cancer. </li>
    <li>The use of ultrasound (US) as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of pressure injuries is contraindicated in people with uncontrolled bleeding tissue, untreated hemorrhagic disorders, areas of suspected or known malignancy, active deep vein thrombosis (DVT) causing clot, recently radiated tissues or ectopic bone formation (e.g., myositis ossificans), and tissues with encapsulated or virulent infection (e.g., tuberculosis). </li>
    <li>Repositioning may be medically contraindicated due to fractures or an unstable spine. </li>
    <li>It is important to note that autolytic debridement should not be used when a wound infection has not been treated or for large pressure injuries (where necrotic tissue exceeds 50 percent). </li>
    <li>Electrical stimulation (ES) should not be used in people with certain medical conditions, including osteomyelitis or local cancer, or in people with implanted electronic devices or who have a blood clot in their leg. ES should also not be applied over the pregnant uterus, wound dressings containing metallic or ionic components, or certain body locations containing excitable tissue (e.g., perineum, anterior neck). </li>

    <li>These guidelines are not binding on nurses, other health care professionals, or the organizations that employ them. The use of these guidelines should be flexible, and based on individual needs and local circumstances. They neither constitute a liability nor discharge from liability. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the contents at the time of publication, neither the authors nor the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) gives any guarantee as to the accuracy of the information contained in them or accepts any liability with respect to loss, damage, injury, or expense arising from any such errors or omissions in the contents of this work. </li>
    <li>This interprofessional Best Practice Guideline (BPG) is a comprehensive document that provides resources for evidence-based interprofessional practice. It is not intended to be a manual or "how to" guide, but rather a tool to guide best practices and enhance decision making for interprofessional teams working with people with existing pressure injuries. The guideline should be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of the individual organizations or practice settings, and the needs and preferences of the person with a pressure injury. In addition, the guideline provides an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care. </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> (2nd ed.; 2012) provides an evidence-informed process for doing this (see Appendix Y in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health care is more likely when:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses the "Knowledge-to-Action" framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.</p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of the Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). The RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including: (1) the Nursing Best Practice Champion Network&reg;, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs; (2) nursing order sets, which provide clear, concise, actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic medical records or used in paper-based or hybrid environments; and (3) the Best Practice Spotlight Organization&reg; (BPSO&reg;) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs&reg; focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs. In addition, the RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific BPGs and their implementation annually.</p>
