Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level 30-day risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal diagnosis of ischemic stroke. The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission. A specified set of planned readmissions do not count as readmissions. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Improvements in the quality of care for patients experiencing a stroke have the potential to lead to both substantial improvements in patient quality of life and lower overall health care expenditures. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has contracted with Yale New Haven Health Services Corporation/Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (YNHHSC/CORE) to develop hospital outcomes measures that reflect the quality of care delivered to patients who are hospitalized with stroke.</p>
<p>Hospital readmission, for any reason, is disruptive to patients and caregivers, costly to the healthcare system, and puts patients at additional risk of hospital acquired infections and complications. Hospital readmissions after stroke may result from the progression of disease, but may also be an indicator of poor care. Research has shown that readmission rates are influenced by the quality of inpatient and outpatient care, and that improvements in care, such as improved discharge processes, can reduce readmission rates (Jack et al., 2009; Naylor et al., 1999; Bravata et al., 2007). Given the high risk of readmission for patients following an ischemic stroke, measurement and reporting of stroke readmission rates will inform health care providers about opportunities to improve care and will strengthen incentives for quality improvement. Improved quality of stroke care has the potential to reduce readmissions, lower the cost of care associated with those readmissions, and improve patient outcomes.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity for patients. It increases patients' likelihood of dependence on the healthcare system and is a condition that contributes greatly to the cost of healthcare in the United States (U.S.). There is good evidence of variation in readmission rates for stroke patients. For these reasons stroke is an important target for quality measurement and improvement initiatives. </p>
<p>Stroke is a priority area for outcomes measure development as it is a relatively common condition with potentially debilitating effects. Approximately 7 million Americans have experienced and survived a stroke (Roger et al., 2012). Stroke affects approximately 795,000 people each year in the U.S., and of these strokes, about 610,000 are first attacks and 185,000 are recurrent attacks (Roger et al., 2012). By 2030, it is projected than an additional 4 million people will have had a stroke, a 24.9% increase in prevalence from 2010 (Roger et al., 2012). </p>
<p>Stroke is a disease associated with high rates of preventable complications and discharge to settings with substantial requirements for ongoing care, e.g., home health or rehabilitation settings. Both of these factors provide numerous opportunities for potential readmissions, and, consequently, opportunities to reduce readmission rates with appropriate interventions and care decisions. </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models</strong></p>
<p>The stroke readmission measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models using the July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year.</p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero.</p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.6 of the original measure documentation. </p>
<p><strong>Stroke Readmission 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of Stroke Model Variables</em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include an increase in Renal failure (28.4% to 30.5%).</p>
<p><em>Stroke Model Parameters and Performance</em></p>
<p>Table 4.6.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.6.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the stroke readmission model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic remained constant at 0.61.</p>

The measure assesses unplanned readmissions, from any cause, within 30 days from the date of discharge from an index ischemic stroke admission.</p>
<p>If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, only the first is considered a readmission. The measures assess a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has any unplanned readmission within 30 days. If the first readmission after discharge is planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not considered in the outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.</p>
<p>The risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions at a given hospital, multiplied by the national observed readmission rate. For each hospital, the numerator of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted based on the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.</p>

Admissions identified as planned by the planned readmissions algorithm are not counted as readmissions. The planned readmission algorithm is a set of criteria for classifying readmissions and planned among the general Medicare population using Medicare administrative claims data. The algorithm identifies admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. </p>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm has three fundamental principles: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>
    <li>Otherwise, a planned readmission is defined as a non-acute readmission for a scheduled procedure; and </li>
    <li>Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned </li>
</ol>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm uses a flow chart and four tables of specific procedure categories and discharge diagnosis categories to classify readmissions as planned. The flow chart and tables are available in the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;cid=1219069855841" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 Condition-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures</a></em>. </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measures to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. </p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission.</p></div>
