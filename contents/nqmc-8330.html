<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients age 18 years and older&nbsp;who receive a statin agent within 24 hours of arrival and at discharge from hospital for whom treatment is appropriate.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the timely initiation of treatment to reduce post-infarction mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).</p>
<p>Studies by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute estimate that each year approximately 785,000 Americans will have a new coronary attack and approximately 470,000 will have a recurrent attack.</p>
<p>Patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be treated with statins. Statins may reduce recurrent ischemic event after ACS, all-cause mortality and revascularization. Patients should be started on statins regardless of baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Higher baseline LDL level at the time of ACS will draw more benefits from statin therapy than lower LDL levels. Most patients should be receiving a statin (or alternative lipid-lowering medication if intolerant to statins) at discharge from the hospital.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>With recent evidence-based changes in both interventional percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and pharmacological interventions in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) found that in the United States, adhering to these new changes, rates of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, and new myocardial infarctions in patients with non-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI) events have significantly decreased. Similarly, in the STEMI population there has been a significant decrease in rates of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, heart failure and pulmonary edema. </li>
    <li>The National Quality Improvement Initiative found that the guidelines and treatments recommended by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) were only followed 74% of the time in 350 of the U.S. hospitals it studied. Not adhering to the ACC/AHA guidelines for recommended care of patients with ACS/NSTEMI has been associated with increased in-hospital mortality. </li>
