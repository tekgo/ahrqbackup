<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The task force worked with medical librarians to determine appropriate search terms and to create search strategies for each guideline chapter. The National Library of Medicine and the Cochrane Library were searched for literature published between 1966 and October 2014. Task force members used the article inclusion/exclusion criteria described below to screen abstracts and provide a list of relevant articles for full-text review. Task force members were blinded to the selection of abstracts provided by other task force members. Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) staff compiled lists of manuscripts for full-text review and approval by all of the task force members, and these full-text articles were reviewed by all task force members. In addition, task force members also screened the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews for potentially relevant articles.</p>
<p><strong>Article Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Included articles must have met certain criteria, as detailed below. To reduce bias, these criteria were specified before conducting the literature searches. To be included in the review, an article had to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Studies had to investigate pediatric (&lt;18 years of age) patients with non-synostotic plagiocephaly or brachycephaly. </li>
    <li>Studies with mixed patient populations and that combined the results of these patient groups must have enrolled &ge;80% of pediatric patients with plagiocephaly or brachycephaly. </li>
    <li>The study was a full article report of a clinical study. </li>
    <li>Studies had to have appeared in a peer-reviewed publication or a registry report. </li>
    <li>Studies had to enroll at least 10 patients (5 per treatment arm) for each distinct outcome measured. If it was a comparative study, a minimum enrollment of 5 patients per treatment arm for each outcome was necessary. </li>
    <li>The study involved humans. </li>
    <li>The study was published in or after 1966. </li>
    <li>The study presented results quantitatively. </li>
    <li>The study did not involve "in vitro," "biomechanical," or results performed on cadavers. </li>
    <li>The study was published in English. </li>
</ul>
<p>Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or guidelines developed by others were not considered as evidence to support this guideline. The task force screened the bibliographies of these publications to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the literature search results used for this guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Search Strategy for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The task force members collaborated with medical librarians to search the National Library of Medicine/PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for the period from 1966 to October 2014 using the MeSH subject headings and PubMed search strategies provided in Appendix A of the full version of the guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Manual searches of bibliographies were also conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Search Results</strong></p>
<p>The searches resulted in 204 abstracts. The task force selected 42 full-text articles for review. Of these, 10 were rejected for not meeting inclusion criteria or for being off-topic (see Figure 1 in the full version of the guideline [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Abstracts were reviewed and an evidentiary table was assembled summarizing the studies and the quality of evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rating Quality of Diagnostic Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>For diagnostic-type papers, evidence classification had definitions targeted toward diagnosis. The issues addressed by papers on diagnosis are related to the ability of the diagnostic test to successfully distinguish between patients who have and do not have a disease or pertinent finding. This speaks to the validity of the test and is illustrated in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field. Additional information regarding the hierarchy classification of evidence can be located on the <a href="https://www.cns.org/guidelines/guideline-procedures-policies/guideline-development-methodology" title="CNS Web site">Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Many of the imaging studies were not designed to address the diagnostic utility of the imaging modality, and authors were actually assessing the utility of the imaging in longitudinal follow-up, not initial diagnosis. For this reason, some of the studies reviewed were downgraded in Level of Evidence.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The development of these guidelines was initiated by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the Section on Pediatric Neurosurgery in response to members' concerns about the variation in the diagnosis and treatment paradigms being utilized. A multidisciplinary team comprised of physician volunteers (clinical experts), a clinical guidelines expert, and medical librarians was convened to conduct a systematic search of the literature and prepare clinical guidelines on the topic of pediatric plagiocephaly. After initial discussions, the members of the Plagiocephaly Guideline Task Force (hereinafter referred to as "the task force") decided, a priori, that the 4 major sub-topics would include: imaging modalities in the diagnosis of plagiocephaly, repositioning, physical therapy, and molding orthoses (helmet therapy).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations Rating Scheme</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force used the methodologies endorsed by the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) to assign a strength of recommendation for each recommendation included in this guideline. Linking evidence to recommendations, through the utilization of evidentiary tables, has been endorsed by the American Medical Association (AMA), the CNS, and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). This process validates and supports the relationship between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations.</p>
<p>Demonstrating the highest degree of clinical certainty, Class I evidence is used to support recommendations of the strongest type, defined as Level I recommendations. Level II recommendations reflect a moderate degree of clinical certainty and are supported by Class II evidence or strong consensus of Class III evidence. Level III recommendations denote clinical uncertainty supported by inconclusive or conflicting evidence or expert opinion.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Voting on the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force used voting among its members to approve the final recommendations, language, and strength of recommendations. The voting was used to ensure that the language of each recommendation accurately reflected the evidence and the strength of the evidence. All the recommendations in this review were approved following the first round of voting, and no further discussion was needed to finalize the recommendations. The voting technique is referred to as the nominal group technique. During the course of editing and finalization of the document, changes were made to allow recommendations to conform to the rules of evidence and language as described above. When this occurred, the changes were reviewed and approved by the group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus and Approval Process</span></strong></p>
<p>Topic teams were created from the task force based on expertise of the task force members with respect to each topic addressed within the review. Each group took part in literature selection, review of the literature, creation of the evidence tables, creation of the guideline, editing, and final review. The final draft of the guideline was then circulated to the entire task force for feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The diagnosis of true craniosynostosis is important because this condition is amenable to surgical correction, whereas positional, posterior plagiocephaly without synostosis (PWS) is adequately treated with repositioning, physical therapy, or, in moderate to severe cases, a cranial molding helmet. It has been the experience of many craniofacial specialists, including those on the Plagiocephaly Task Force, that most infants with plagiocephaly can be adequately diagnosed through a detailed clinical examination. Three dimensional (3-D) topographical scanning may be useful for diagnosis and baseline assessment of severity. In those rare cases in which the clinical examination was equivocal, skull x-rays or an ultrasound of the suture in question could be used to rule out craniosynostosis. Only if those radiological studies are equivocal, should a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head be performed.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>False-positive and false-negative results of imaging </li>
    <li>Risk of radiation exposure in infancy is of obvious concern, and unnecessary computed tomography (CT) scans should be avoided. </li>
