<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of evidence for therapeutic interventions (<strong>High, Moderate, Low, Very Low</strong>) for questions 5-9 are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1: What Is the Definition of Functional Constipation?</strong></p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee recommends the Rome III criteria for the definition of functional constipation for all age groups (see Table 2 in original guideline document).</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the diagnosis of functional constipation is based on history and physical examination.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: What Are the Alarm Signs and Symptoms That Suggest the Presence of an Underlying Disease Causing the Constipation?</strong></p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee recommends using Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the original guideline document for alarm signs and symptoms and diagnostic clues to identify an underlying disease responsible for the constipation.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3: In the Diagnosis of Functional Constipation in Children, What Is the Diagnostic Value of Digital Rectal Examination, Abdominal Radiography, Colonic Transit Time and Transabdominal Rectal Ultrasonography?</strong></p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, if only 1 of the Rome III criteria is present and the diagnosis of functional constipation is uncertain, a digital examination of the anorectum is recommended.</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, in the presence of alarm signs or symptoms or in patients with intractable constipation, a digital examination of the anorectum is recommended to exclude underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>The routine use of an abdominal radiograph to diagnose functional constipation is not indicated.</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, plain abdominal radiography may be used in a child in whom fecal impaction is suspected but in whom physical examination is unreliable/not possible.</p>
<p>Colonic transit studies are not recommended to diagnose functional constipation.</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, a colonic transit study may be useful to discriminate between functional constipation and functional nonretentive fecal incontinence and in situations in which the diagnosis is not clear.</p>
<p>Rectal ultrasound is not recommended to diagnose functional constipation.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4: Which of the Following Diagnostic Tests Should Be Performed in Children with Constipation to Diagnose an Underlying Disease?</strong></p>
<p>Routine allergy testing is not recommended to diagnose cow's-milk allergy in children with functional constipation.</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, a 2- to 4-week trial of avoidance of cow's-milk protein (CMP) may be indicated in the child with intractable constipation.</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee does not recommend routine laboratory testing for hypothyroidism, celiac disease, and hypercalcemia in children with constipation in the absence of alarm symptoms.</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the main indication to perform anorectal manometry (ARM) in the evaluation of intractable constipation is to assess the presence of the rectoanal-inhibitory reflex (RAIR).</p>
<p>Rectal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease (HD).</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee does not recommend performing barium enema as an initial diagnostic tool for the evaluation of children with constipation.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5: Which of the Following Examinations Should Be Performed in Children with Intractable Constipation to Evaluate Pathophysiology and Diagnose an Underlying Abnormality?</strong></p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, colonic manometry may be indicated in patients with intractable constipation before considering surgical intervention.</p>
<p>The routine use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is not recommended in patients with intractable constipation without other neurologic abnormalities.</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee does not recommend obtaining full-thickness colonic biopsies to diagnose colonic neuromuscular disorders in children with intractable constipation.</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee does not recommend routine use of colonic scintigraphy studies in children with intractable constipation.</p>
<p><strong>Question 6: What Is the Additional Effect of the Following Nonpharmacologic Treatments in Children with Functional Constipation?</strong></p>
<p>A normal fiber intake is recommended in children with constipation. (<strong>Very Low</strong>)</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee recommends a normal fluid intake in children with constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee recommends a normal physical activity in children with constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>The routine use of prebiotics is not recommended in the treatment of childhood constipation. (<strong>Very Low</strong>)</p>
<p>The routine use of probiotics is not recommended in the treatment of childhood constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>The routine use of an intensive behavioral protocolized therapy program in addition to conventional treatment is not recommended in childhood constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee recommends demystification, explanation, and guidance for toilet training (in children with a developmental age of at least 4 years) in the treatment of childhood constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>The use of biofeedback as additional treatment is not recommended in childhood constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee does not recommend the routine use of multidisciplinary treatment in childhood constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee does not recommend the use of alternative treatments in childhood constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Question 7: What Is the Most Effective and Safest Pharmacologic Treatment in Children with Functional Constipation?</strong></p>
<p>The use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with or without electrolytes orally 1 to 1.5 g &middot; kg<sup>-1</sup> &middot; day<sup>-1</sup> for 3 to 6 days is recommended as the first-line treatment for children presenting with fecal impaction. (<strong>Very Low</strong>)</p>
<p>An enema once per day for 3 to 6 days is recommended for children with fecal impaction, if PEG is not available. (<strong>Very Low</strong>)</p>
<p>The use of PEG with or without electrolytes is recommended as the first-line maintenance treatment. A starting dose of 0.4 g &middot; kg<sup>-1</sup> &middot; day<sup>-1</sup> is recommended and the dose should be adjusted according to the clinical response. (<strong>Very Low</strong>)</p>
<p>The addition of enemas to the chronic use of PEG is not recommended in children with constipation. (<strong>Very Low</strong>)</p>
<p>The use of lactulose as the first-line maintenance treatment is recommended, if PEG is not available. (<strong>Very Low</strong>)</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the use of milk of magnesia, mineral oil, and stimulant laxatives may be considered as an additional or second-line treatment. (<strong>Very Low</strong>)</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, maintenance treatment should continue for at least 2 months. All symptoms of constipation symptoms should be resolved for at least 1 month before discontinuation of treatment. Treatment should be decreased gradually. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, in the developmental stage of toilet training, medication should only be stopped once toilet training is achieved. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Question 8: What Is the Efficacy and Safety of Novel Therapies for Children with Intractable Constipation?</strong></p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee does not recommend the routine use of lubiprostone, linaclotide, and prucalopride in children with intractable constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>Based on expert opinion, the guideline committee recommends antegrade enemas in the treatment of selected children with intractable constipation. (<strong>Low</strong>)</p>
<p>The routine use of transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) in children with intractable constipation is not recommended. (<strong>Very Low</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Question 9: What Is the Prognosis and What Are Prognostic Factors in Children with Functional Constipation?</strong></p>
<p>See Table 7 in the original guideline document. See also the Appendix for more details (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Systematic literature searches were performed by a clinical librarian from inception to October 2011. The EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and PsycINFO databases were searched.</p>
<p>The inclusion criteria were as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Study population consisting of children of ages 0 to 18 years in whom functional constipation was diagnosed, treated, or its course followed. The key words used to describe constipation were "constipation," "obstipation," "faecal/fecal incontinence," "coprostasis," "encopresis," and "soiling." Excluded were the studies concerning children with organic causes of constipation and children with exclusively functional nonretentive fecal incontinence. </li>
    <li>A clear definition of functional constipation had to be provided by the authors. </li>
    <li>To evaluate the value of tests in diagnosing functional constipation (question 3), the committee included systematic reviews and original studies related to the diagnostic accuracy of the specific tests. The reference standard for functional constipation had to be defined by the authors in terms of findings at history and physical examination. </li>
    <li>In studies evaluating the effects of treatments or interventions (questions 6, 7, and 8), the following inclusion criterion was used: systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and/or RCTs containing at least 10 individuals per arm. </li>
    <li>In studies evaluating the outcome of functional constipation (questions 4, 5, and 9), the following inclusion criteria were used: systematic reviews of prospective or retrospective controlled studies and original studies with a follow-up of at least 8 weeks. </li>
</ol>
<p>An additional strategy to identify studies involved searching the reference lists of review articles and included studies. No language restriction was applied. Furthermore, all of the guideline members were asked to search the literature with respect to their assigned topics to possibly uncover further studies that may have been missed by the former search.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The approach of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to identify outcomes. A draft version was circulated, and every workgroup member was allowed to add outcomes. Group members were asked to rate relative importance of the outcomes on a 9-point scale: limited (1&ndash;3), important but not critical (4&ndash;6), or critical (7&ndash;9) for decision making. The workgroup members were also asked to discuss personal experience. Based on the answers of the guidelines group members and patient preferences from a focus group, 8 outcome measures were selected: pain during defecation, defecation &ge;3 times per week, fecal incontinence frequency, difficulty with defecation, worsening constipation, quality of life, possible harm from laxatives (cancer, tolerance, adverse effects), and abdominal pain.</p>
<p>The levels and quality of evidence were assessed using the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (<a href="http://www.cebm.net" title="CEBM Web site">http://www.cebm.net</a>) (diagnostic and prognostic questions) and the GRADE system (therapeutic questions) and are summarized in the online-only appendix (<a href="http://links.lww.com/MPG/A295" title="LWW Web site">http://links.lww.com/MPG/A295</a>). Grades of evidence for each statement are based on the grading of the literature. If no therapeutic studies were found, we decided to define the quality of evidence as "low."</p>
<p>Using the GRADE system, the quality of evidence for therapeutic interventions (questions 5, 6, and 9) was graded as shown in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field.</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The project started in September 2011 by formulating 9 clinical questions (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Seven questions were chosen based on the Dutch guidelines for functional constipation. In addition, 2 new questions were added to the present guidelines: questions 5 and 8. After the questions were formulated, the guidelines committee was subdivided into subgroups that dealt with each question separately. Questions 1 and 2 were answered based on expert opinions and earlier published guidelines. Questions 3 to 9 were answered using the results of systematic literature searches.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Meeting and Voting</strong></p>
<p>Three consensus meetings were held to achieve consensus on and formulate all of the recommendations: September 2012, February 2013, and May 2013. Each subgroup presented the recommendations during the consensus meetings, wherein these were then discussed and modified according to the comments of the attendees. The consensus was formally achieved through nominal group technique, a structured quantitative method. The group anonymously voted on each recommendation. A 9-point scale was used (1=strongly disagree to 9=fully agree), and votes are reported by each recommendation. It was decided in advance that consensus was reached, if &gt;75% of the working group members voted 6, 7, 8, or 9. The consensus was reached for all of the questions.</p></div>
