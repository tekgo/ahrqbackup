<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of women 67 to 85 years of age who suffered a fracture and who had either a bone mineral density (BMD) test or prescription for a drug to treat or prevent osteoporosis in the six months after the fracture.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength that puts a person at increased risk for fractures. Morbidity and mortality related to osteoporotic fractures are a major health issue. Ten million Americans have osteoporosis, and another 18 million are at risk for osteoporosis due to low bone mass (National Institutes of Health [NIH] Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis Prevention, Diagnosis, and Therapy, 2001). Eighty percent of people with osteoporosis are women (NIH Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis Prevention, Diagnosis, and Therapy, 2001). Women who suffer a fracture are at increased risk of suffering additional fractures.</p>
<p>Treatment of osteoporotic fractures is estimated at $10 to $15 billion annually in the United States (U.S). In 1995, osteoporotic fractures caused 432,000 hospital admissions, 2.5 million physician visits and 180,000 nursing home admissions. The aging U.S. population is likely to increase the future financial cost of osteoporosis care.</p>
<p>One study showed that less than 5 percent of patients with osteoporotic fractures are referred for medical evaluation and treatment (NIH Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis Prevention, Diagnosis, and Therapy, 2001). Another retrospective study of over 1,000 postmenopausal women who sustained a fracture of the distal radius found that only 24 percent received either a diagnostic evaluation or treatment for the condition (Stephen &amp; Wallace, 2001).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by low bone mass, which leads to bone fragility and increased susceptibility to fractures of the hip, spine and wrist (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [NIAMS], 2012). Osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, are associated with chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, decreased quality of life and increased mortality (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2011). </li>
    <li>By 2025, annual fractures are expected to rise by almost 50 percent and incur $25.3 billion in health care costs (Burge et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Osteoporosis is more common in women than men and is more common in white persons than in any other racial group (USPSTF, 2011). The prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age: 7 percent of women 50 to 59 have osteoporosis, 10 percent of women 60 to 69, 27 percent of women 70 to 79 and 35 percent of women 80 years and older have it (Looker et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Osteoporotic fractures are responsible for almost 2.5 million medical office visits and for more than 432,000 hospital and 180,000 nursing home admissions each year (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS] &amp; Office of the Surgeon General, 2004). </li>
    <li>Osteoporosis is a serious disease in the elderly that can impact their quality of life. With appropriate screening and treatment, the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures can be reduced. </li>
