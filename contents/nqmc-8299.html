Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the proportion of outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving inhalation therapy who have their inhaler technique checked at least once a year.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Inhalation therapy is the preferred form of administration in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and several inhalation systems are available. The guidelines underline the importance that inhalation technique is demonstrated, practised and checked when the patient is provided with a new therapy and that the technique subsequently is checked regularly.</p></div>
