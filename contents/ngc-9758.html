<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Administration of methylprednisolone (MP) for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is not recommended. Clinicians considering MP therapy should bear in mind that the drug is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this application. There is no <strong>Class I</strong> or <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence supporting the clinical benefit of MP in the treatment of acute SCI. Scattered reports of <strong>Class III</strong> evidence claim inconsistent effects likely related to random chance or selection bias. However, <strong>Class I, II</strong>, and <strong>III</strong> evidence exists that high-dose steroids are associated with harmful side effects including death. </li>
    <li>Administration of GM-1 ganglioside (Sygen) for the treatment of acute SCI is not recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Methylprednisolone</strong></p>
<p>Despite 4 prospective blinded randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of MP in acute SCI, there exists no <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence of any beneficial effect. Two prospective <strong>Class II</strong> trials also failed to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of MP in SCI. In total, over 980 patients have received steroids for SCI and over 280 have participated as control subjects within the protocol of a prospective clinical trial&mdash;in which, universally, all primary comparisons to establish efficacy have been negative.</p>
<p>A variety of <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence has been published supporting the neuroprotective effect of MP in SCI. In general, these studies suffer from 1 of 2 significant limitations: limited sample size derived retrospectively from much larger study populations and/or incomplete data reporting in which omitted data are likely to have negated the proposed beneficial effect. Additionally, the beneficial effects claimed related to MP administration in the setting of acute SCI have been inconsistent. Patients are reported to have demonstrated improvement in sensory but not motor function, motor but not sensory function, or some other (undefined) type of neurological recovery. It is important to note than none of these retrospective data analyses have claimed neurological improvement of a meaningful functional or behavioral nature. In light of both significant methodological errors and inconsistent neurological outcomes, the beneficial effects of MP can as easily be ascribed to random chance as to any true therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>Harmful side effects of MP administration in the setting of acute SCI have been reported as significant in 3 <strong>Class I</strong> studies, including wound infection, hyperglycemia requiring insulin administration, and gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. Although not statistically significant, similar trends were observed in <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence from National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) II and III, including GI hemorrhage, sepsis, pneumonia, and death due to respiratory failure. In addition, <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence shows a significantly higher risk of infection (respiratory, urinary, wound) and steroid-induced myopathy in patients treated with MP compared to controls. Several <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence studies describe similar adverse events of statistical significance including pneumonia, respiratory failure, peptic ulcer disease, GI hemorrhage, and hyperglycemia requiring insulin administration. Most compelling is the <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence from over 10,000 patients with head injury, indicating that high-dose MP administration leads to significantly higher mortality independent of injury severity.</p>
<p>In summary, there is no consistent or compelling medical evidence of any class to justify the administration of MP for acute SCI. Both consistent and compelling <strong>Class I, II</strong>, and<strong> III</strong> medical evidence exists suggesting that high-dose MP administration is associated with a variety of complications including infection, respiratory compromise, GI hemorrhage, and death. MP should not be routinely used in the treatment of patients with acute SCI.</p>
<p><strong>GM-1 Ganglioside (Sygen)</strong></p>
<p>Found indigenously in cell membranes of mammalian central nervous system tissue, GM-1 ganglioside is a compound thought to have antiexcitotoxic activity, promote neuritic sprouting, potentiate the effects of nerve growth factor, and prevent apoptosis. In 1991, a research group reported promising results of a pilot study investigating its use in acute SCI. All patients received a 250 mg bolus of MP followed by 125 mg every 6 hours for 72 hours. GM-1 patients were administered 100 mg of GM-1 per day for 18 to 32 days, with the first dose provided within 72 hours of injury. Neurological assessment was accomplished with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score assessments and the Frankel scale.</p>
<p>Of 37 patients entered into the study, 34 were available for 1-year follow up (16 GM-1 patients, 18 placebo). GM-1 ganglioside-treated patients showed significant improvement in Frankel grade from baseline to 1-year follow-up (<em>P</em> = .034) and significantly greater improvement in ASIA motor scores compared to placebo-treated patients (<em>P</em> = .047). The recovery of motor function in GM-1 ganglioside-treated patients was felt to be due to recovery of strength in paralyzed muscles rather than strengthening of paretic muscles. There were no adverse effects attributed to the administration of the study drug. The authors concluded that GM-1 ganglioside enhanced neurological recovery in human patients following SCI and deserved further study.</p>
<p>The subsequent multicenter study involved 28 neurotrauma institutions and randomized 797 patients within 72 hours of injury to receive either GM-1 ganglioside (100 or 200 mg intravenously [i.v.]/day) or placebo for a total of 56 days. All patients received NASCIS II doses of MP within 8 hours of injury. The duration of follow up was 1 year. Although patients with ASIA grade C and D SCI treated with Sygen demonstrated statistically significant improvement in modified Benzel grade compared to placebo-treated patients at 4 and 8 weeks after injury, the advantage was lost at subsequent follow-up visits. No difference between actively treated and placebo-treated patients was noted in any of the outcome measures at 1 year. There have been no further studies to confirm or refute these results in the last decade. Consequently, GM-1 ganglioside is not recommended for use in the routine management of patients with acute SCI at this time.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search from 1966 to 2011 was undertaken using Medical Subject Headings of "steroids," "methylprednisolone," and "GM-1 ganglioside" in combination with "spinal cord injury" and "neurological deficit." Approximately 680,000 citations were acquired. Non-English-language citations were excluded, as were nonhuman experimental studies. Titles and abstracts of 641 manuscripts were reviewed, 589 on the topic of steroids and human spinal cord injury (SCI) and 52 on the topic of GM-1 ganglioside and human SCI. Additional publications were cross-referenced from the citation lists of the remaining papers. Finally, the members of the author group were asked to contribute articles known to them on the subject matter that were not found by other search means. Duplications, case reports, pharmacokinetic reports, general reviews, editorials, critiques, and manuscripts with mention of one agent or another but without original data were eliminated.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
