<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This patient-centered measure addresses follow-up of patients who have undergone implantation of a cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED). A well-established and efficient follow-up program for patients who have undergone implantation of a CIED is important to improve intermediate and longer term outcomes and for purposes of better care coordination. Based on this evidence, the expert clinical guidance recommends that patients with devices have an in-person follow-up appointment 2 to 12 weeks following implantation and have a yearly in-person evaluation from the time of implantation. There is evidence that follow-up is associated with a reduction of inappropriate or "unnecessary" implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. Appropriate device programming can impact patient outcomes following CIED implantation. Intermediate outcomes include optimizing cardiac device function to meet the patient's clinical needs, early identification of device or lead failures, minimizing inappropriate shocks (which are associated with increased risk of heart failure and death), detecting and treating arrhythmias, and early identification of infection. Health outcomes include improving the patient's quality of life (e.g., optimizing ICD programming may reduce unnecessary device therapy and even reduce mortality). It has been recently demonstrated that follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks after CIED placement is independently associated with improved survival at 1 year (Hess et al., 2013). In addition, this measure can help to assure that follow-up occurs regardless of where the patient receives care. </p>
<p>This measure also targets an important gap in care. Among patients eligible for an in-person CIED follow-up after implantation, only 42.4% had an initial in-person visit within 2 to 12 weeks. Disparities also have been identified, with follow-up visits significantly more common among whites than blacks and patients of other races (43.0% versus 36.8% versus 40.5%; P less than 0.001) (Al-Khatib et al., 2013).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In March 2010, the Heart Rhythm Society's (HRS) Quality Improvement Subcommittee conducted a strategic planning meeting to identify recommendations on how the Society could best prepare for the increased focus of performance measurement by the United States (U.S.) government and others. The topics discussed included performance measurement in general, as well as public reporting and value-based purchasing, specifically. Through the work of the Measure Development Task Force during cycle 1 of the initiative, two physician-level measures were fully-specified and tested: <em>HRS-3: Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) Complications Rate</em> and <em>HRS-4: In-Person Evaluation Following Implantation of a Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Device (CIED)</em>. The measures were developed with the intent to submit them to the National Quality Forum (NQF) for endorsement consideration when a relevant call for measures is issued. Pilot testing is a prerequisite for NQF.</p>
<p>In November 2012, HRS completed the field testing of HRS-4 at four HRS-volunteer sites to assess reliability and validity. Additionally, to assess the performance gap for HRS-4, HRS made arrangements with OptumInsight to use its anonymized database of claims information to conduct a national, 3-year assessment for performance on the measure based on an algorithm derived from the measure specifications. Based on the testing results, <em>HRS-4: In-Person Evaluation Following Implantation of a CIED</em> is valid and reliable and there is a significant gap with much room for improvement.</p>
<p>In 2014, in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Colorado, the Society conducted an implementation pilot on <em>HRS-4: In-Person Evaluation Following Implantation of a CIED</em> with the goal of demonstrating that the information gathered by the HRS-4 measure is meaningful, understandable, and useful for quality improvement and that the data collection strategy can be implemented. Two sites retrospectively collected data using an implementation protocol and calculated performance scores using a data collection algorithm. The pilot showed a gap in care related to the in-person follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks after implant. The pilot also raised the challenge of tracking patients who have an implant at one center and their follow-up visit at another location outside the system. As the results of the pilot, the scope findings of the pilot, the scope of the measure was limited to Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries. </p></div>
