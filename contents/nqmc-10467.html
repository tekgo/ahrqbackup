<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for whom a tuberculosis (TB) screening was performed and results interpreted within 6 months prior to receiving a first course of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Before initiating biologic anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) therapy for a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it is essential to screen the patient for tuberculosis (TB), as research has documented a higher incidence of TB after anti-TNF therapy. All patients being considered for biologic anti-TNF therapy should receive a tuberculin skin test, even if the patient has previously received the Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccination. Test results, in addition to patient risk for TB and other tests, should be used to assess the patient's risk for latent TB infection. This is a patient safety measure.</p>
<p>Opportunity for improvement: While there are a limited number of studies that investigate gaps in care for patients with IBD, the research that does exist identifies opportunities for improvement in care areas: 1) there is a lack of adherence to tuberculosis screening, most noticeably in the use of disease-modifying anti-TNF drugs, and 2) variations in care by practice setting, geographic region and physician specialty. </p>
<p>Golimumab, certolizumab pegol, infliximab and adalimumab may all trigger latent TB. Also, all patients should be monitored during therapy for active TB even if the initial latent TB testing is negative. </p>
<p>Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has been reported in patients who are carriers of this virus and are taking TNF blocker medicines (Kaiser et al., 2009). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>: </p>
<p>Prior to commencing treatment with anti-TNF, all patients should be screened for TB in accordance with the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines. Active TB needs to be adequately treated before anti-TNF therapy can be started. Prior to commencing anti-TNF therapy, consideration of prophylactic anti-TB therapy (as directed by the BTS guidelines) should be given to patients with evidence of potential latent disease (past history of TB treatment or abnormal chest X-ray raising the possibility of TB) after consultation with a local TB specialist. All patients commenced on anti-TNF therapies need to be closely monitored for TB (Ledingham, Deighton, &amp; British Society for Rheumatology Standards, Guidelines and Audit Working Group, 2005). </p>
<p>In an immunocompromised person (adult or child), the tuberculin skin test (TST) should be the initial test used to detect latent TB infection (LTBI). If the TST is positive, the person should be considered to have LTBI. </p>
<p>However, in light of the known problem with false-negative TST results in immunocompromised populations, a clinician still concerned about the possibility of LTBI in an immunocompromised person with a negative initial TST result may perform an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) test. If the IGRA result is positive, the person might be considered to have LTBI. If the IGRA result is indeterminate, the test should be repeated to rule out laboratory error. If the repeat test is also indeterminate, the clinician should suspect anergy and rely on the person's history, clinical features, and any other laboratory results to make a decision as to the likelihood of LTBI. Although both IGRAs may be used as described above, there is evidence that the T-SPOT.TB assay may be more sensitive than the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay in active TB, and this characteristic might be especially relevant in immunocompromised populations. While the approach of accepting either test result (TST or IGRA) as positive will improve the sensitivity of detecting LTBI in immunocompromised populations, there are no data supporting the efficacy of preventive therapy in TST-negative but IGRA-positive individuals. Thus the clinician must weigh the potential benefit of detecting more persons with positive test results against the lack of evidence for the benefit of preventive therapy in such persons (Canada Tuberculosis Committee [CTC], 2008). </p>
<p>Infliximab can reactivate latent HBV (Esteve et al., 2004).</p></div>
