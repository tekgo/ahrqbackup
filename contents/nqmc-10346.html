Description

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patients with elevated risk for osteoporosis should have the diagnosis of osteoporosis excluded or be on treatment of osteoporosis.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2011) recommends screening for osteoporosis in women aged 65 years and older and in younger women whose fracture risk is equal to or greater than that of a 65-year old white woman who has no additional risk factors.</p>
<p>"Based on the U.S. FRAX tool, a 65-year-old white woman with no other risk factors has a 9.3% 10-year risk for any osteoporotic fracture. White women between the ages of 50 and 64 years with equivalent or greater 10-year fracture risks based on specific risk factors include but are not limited to the following persons: 1) a 50-year-old current smoker with a body mass index (BMI) less than 21 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, daily alcohol use, and parental fracture history; 2) a 55-year-old woman with a parental fracture history; 3) a 60-year-old woman with a body mass index (BMI) less than 21 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and daily alcohol use; and 4) a 60-year-old current smoker with daily alcohol use. The FRAX tool also predicts 10-year fracture risks for black, Asian, and Hispanic women in the United States. In general, estimated fracture risks in nonwhite women are lower than those for white women of the same age" (USPSTF, 2011).</p>
<p>Current diagnostic and treatment criteria for osteoporosis rely on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements only. The USPSTF (2011) did not define a specific upper age limit for screening in women; however they noted that clinicians should take into account the patient's remaining lifespan when deciding whether to screen patients with significant illness; the benefit of treatment emerged 18 to 24 months after initiation of treatment.</p></div>
