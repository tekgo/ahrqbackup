<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level, 30-day risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Mortality is defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the start of the index admission.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is common and associated with considerable risk of morbidity and mortality. Many current hospital interventions are known to decrease the risk of death within 30 days of hospital admission. Current process-based performance measures, however, cannot capture all the ways that care within the hospital might influence outcomes. As a result, many stakeholders, including patient organizations, are interested in outcomes measures that would permit groups of providers to assess their relative outcomes performance for the purpose of internal quality improvement or public reporting. </p>
<p>Since the most commonly available data across hospitals in the United States are administrative billing data, a measure is most widely applicable if it makes use of these data. Since there are concerns about the adequacy of administrative data, the measures using these data should be, if possible, validated against measures based on higher quality data (e.g., chart data). The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) also believes that an outcomes measure for public reporting should have the following properties: the method by which the measure is calculated and information about its performance are publicly available, the patient sample accurately reflects patients treated for the condition at each hospital (e.g., transfers out are included, patients likely not to have AMI despite their International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] code are excluded), the measure is adjusted for conditions present on admission, not those that develop during the hospitalization, the measure is based on a standard period of outcome assessment, the measure is adjusted for past health care utilization history, risk factors are clinically coherent (not just data driven), statistical methods take into account the structure of the data (e.g., patients within hospitals), and results are reported in a way that reflects the degree of certainty about a hospital's performance. In CMS's assessment, no popular outcomes measure for AMI satisfies all of these criteria. Accordingly, CMS has sought to develop a measure with these properties. </p></div>

Denominator Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The measure cohort consists of admissions for Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries aged 65 years or older and discharged from non-federal acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals, having a principal discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).</p>
<p>The risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" deaths to the number of "expected" deaths at a given hospital, multiplied by the national observed mortality rate. For each hospital, the denominator is the number of deaths expected based on the nation's performance with that hospital's case mix.</p>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most common principal hospital discharge diagnoses among older adults and is associated with high mortality. The high prevalence and considerable morbidity and mortality associated with AMI create an economic burden on the healthcare system (American Heart Association, 2010). In 2005, AMI was the fourth most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, accounting for nearly 4% of the national hospital bill. It was also the fourth most expensive condition billed to Medicare that year, accounting for 4.5% of Medicare's hospital bill (Andrews &amp; Elixhauser, 2007). </p>
<p>Approximately 635,000 Americans will have AMI and approximately 280,000 will have a recurrent attack. It is estimated that an additional 150,000 MIs occur each year, creating an estimated total of 1,065,000 AMI related events a year. It is estimated that the combination of direct and indirect health care costs of coronary heart disease reached over $195.2 billion (Rathore et al., 2009). </p>
<p>Many current hospital interventions are known to decrease the risk of death within 30 days of hospital admission (Jha et al., 2007; Rathore et al., 2009). Current process-based performance measures, however, cannot capture all the ways that care within the hospital might influence outcomes. As a result, many stakeholders, including patient organizations, are interested in outcomes measures that allow patients and providers to assess relative outcomes performance for hospitals.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models</strong></p>
<p>The AMI mortality measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized mortality rates (RSMRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models, using the July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year. </p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero. </p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.2 of the original measure documentation. </p>
<p><strong>AMI Mortality 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of AMI Model Variables</em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include an increase in Other location of myocardial infarction (12.0% to 14.5%). </p>
<p><em>AMI Model Parameters and Performance</em></p>
<p>Table 4.2.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.2.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the AMI mortality model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic remained constant at 0.72.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of healthcare that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum's (NQF's) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) mortality rates are higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables.</p>
