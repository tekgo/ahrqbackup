<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A wide range of factors must be taken into account in assessing if proton beam radiotherapy will confer a significant advantage for the patient over standard conformal or stereotactic radiotherapy available in Alberta &ndash; the diagnosis alone is not sufficient. </li>
    <li>Pediatric and adolescent tumour sites that may be considered for referral for out-of-country proton beam radiotherapy include:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>Those requiring craniospinal irradiation </li>
        <li>The following central nervous system (CNS) tumours or lesions: arteriovenous malformations, ependymomas, craniopharyngiomas, CNS germ cell tumours, primitive neuroectodermal tumours, and low grade gliomas </li>
        <li>The following non-CNS tumours: sarcomas including chordoma and chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, pineal tumours, and lymphoma.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Adult tumour sites that may be considered for referral for out-of-country proton beam radiotherapy include:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The following CNS tumours or lesions: arteriovenous malformations, benign meningioma, neuromas, craniopharyngioma, CNS germ cell tumours, and low grade gliomas </li>
        <li>The following non-CNS tumours: sarcoma including chordoma and chondrosarcoma, lymphoma in patients under the age of 30 years, and paranasal sinus and nasal cavity tumours.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Adult, pediatric, and adolescent patients with ocular melanomas requiring proton beam radiotherapy should be sent to the TRIUMF Proton Treatment Facility in Vancouver, British Columbia (BC) for treatment. </li>
    <li>Members of the working group do not currently recommend that patients with prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or most lymphomas be referred for proton beam radiotherapy, due to an insufficient evidence base. However, individual patient cases should be discussed by the multidisciplinary team during a Tumour Board meeting. </li>
    <li>For adult, adolescent, and pediatric cases, the referral for proton beam radiotherapy must come from the consultant oncologist who has seen and assessed the patient. Before the referral is made, a full multidisciplinary Tumour Board meeting should be held in which all tumour group members, including a radiation oncologist, have the opportunity to provide input on the case. In cases of arteriovenous malformations in which there is no tumour present, discussion at an appropriate multidisciplinary meeting that includes a radiation oncologist should follow the same processes as described for multidisciplinary Tumour Board meetings. </li>
    <li>Approval of the referral must be submitted to the Out-of-Country Health Services Committee, which operates at arm's length from Alberta Health. Once approved, the responsibility for referral and communications with the proton beam therapy treatment centre remains with the referring oncologist. The responsibility for follow-up and continuity of care also rests with the referring oncologist. </li>
    <li>Additional and over-riding principles for approval and funding include:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The treatment should be given with curative intent </li>
        <li>The patient should have a good performance status (0-2) </li>
        <li>The expected survival of the patient should be greater than 5 years </li>
        <li>The patient must be able and willing to travel</li>
    </ol>
    </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What is the evidence for the use of proton beam radiation therapy for the management of patients with cancer? </li>
    <li>What are the published recommendations for the selection of patients most likely to benefit from treatment with proton beam radiation therapy? </li>
    <li>What are the steps involved in referring a patient for out-of-country proton beam radiation therapy? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Medical journals were searched using the MEDLINE (1950 to April Week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1980 to April Week 4, 2012), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1st Quarter, 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1st Quarter, 2012), and PubMed electronic databases; the references and bibliographies of studies identified through these searches were scanned for additional sources. The MEDLINE search terms were: Protons (MeSH term) OR Radiotherapy, High Energy (MeSH term) OR particle beam therapy OR charged particle therapy AND Skull Base Neoplasms (MeSH term) OR Spinal Neoplasms (MeSH term) OR Chondrosarcoma (MeSH term) OR Chordoma (MeSH term) OR Sarcoma (MeSH term). The search was limited to studies published in the English language between the years 2000 and 2012. There were no limitations by study design. A search for new or updated guidelines, health technology assessments, and medical policies was conducted by accessing the websites of guideline developers and the National Guideline Clearinghouse database, and by searching the grey literature using online search engines. Summaries of published clinical practice guideline recommendations and health technology assessments are available in Appendix A in the original guideline document.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Alberta Health Services Cancer Care Proton Therapy Guideline Advisory Group members individually reviewed the results of an environmental scan and literature review conducted by a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). Members of this group include representatives from Alberta Health, as well as the departments of medical oncology, radiation oncology, and pediatric neurosurgery at the two tertiary cancer centres in Alberta. A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Trust Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>

<h3>
Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In a modeling study evaluating the consequences of radiotherapy in five-year-old patients with medulloblastoma, researchers reported that proton radiation therapy was cost-effective and was associated with an additional 0.68 quality-adjusted life-years per patient compared with conventional photon radiotherapy. Reductions in IQ loss and growth hormone deficiency contributed most to the cost savings and were the most important parameters for cost-effectiveness. This analysis suggests that proton beam radiotherapy may be cost-saving in comparison to photon radiotherapy for pediatric patients with medulloblastoma due to the reduction of late side-effects. A reduction in side-effects for pediatric patients with medulloblastoma treated with proton beam radiotherapy was also recently demonstrated in a prospective study of 23 pediatric patients who were followed for high-grade ototoxicity, although a cost-benefit analysis was not reported for this trial.</p>
<p>A formal analysis was not conducted by the authors to evaluate the cost of referring a patient for out-of-country proton beam radiation therapy.</p></div>
