<h2>Brief Abstract
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients who had hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and were at risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and were prescribed a CMV disease prevention program for 100 days after HCT.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In the past decade, modifications in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) management and supportive care have resulted in changes in recommendations for the prevention of infection in HCT patients. These changes are fueled by new antimicrobial agents, increased knowledge of immune reconstitution, and expanded conditioning regimens and patient populations eligible for HCT. Despite these advances, infection is reported as the primary cause of death in 8% of autologous HCT patients and 17% to 20% of allogeneic HCT recipients. </p>
<p><em>Support (verbatim) from guidelines</em>: HCT candidates should be tested for the presence of serum anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies before transplantation to determine their risk for primary CMV infection and reactivation after HCT. </p>
<p>HCT recipients at risk for posttransplant CMV disease (i.e., all CMV-seropositive HCT recipients, and all CMV-seronegative recipients with a CMV-seropositive donor) should be placed on a CMV disease prevention program from the time of engraftment until at least 100 days after HCT (i.e., phase II). Physicians should use either prophylaxis or preemptive treatment for allogeneic recipients. In selecting a CMV disease prevention strategy, physicians should assess the risks and benefits of each strategy, the needs and condition of the patient, and the hospital's virology laboratory support capability. </p>
<p>A prophylaxis strategy against early CMV replication (i.e., less than 100 days after HCT) for allogeneic recipients involves administering prophylaxis to all allogeneic recipients at risk throughout the period from engraftment to 100 days after HCT. Ganciclovir, high-dose acyclovir, and valacyclovir have all shown efficacy in randomized studies in reducing the risk for CMV infection after HCT. If ganciclovir is used, the induction course is usually started at engraftment, although a brief prophylactic course can be added during pretransplant conditioning. If acyclovir or valacyclovir is used, the patient must also undergo viral monitoring and receive preemptive antiviral therapy if evidence of CMV replication is found. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is not recommended for CMV disease prophylaxis among HCT recipients. </p>
<p><em>Statement (verbatim) from guidelines on gap</em>: During phase II, infections relate primarily to impaired cell-mediated immunity. The scope and impact of this defect is determined by the extent of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and immunosuppressive therapy for it. Herpesviruses, particularly CMV, are common infectious agents during this period.</p>
<p>During phase III, persons with chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and recipients of alternate-donor allogeneic transplants remain most at risk for infection. Common pathogens include CMV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and infections with encapsulated bacteria (e.g., <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>). The relative risk for these infections is approximately proportional to the severity of the patient's GVHD during phases II and III. </p>
<p><em>Statement from the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASMBT) Task Force on gap</em>: As a common post-transplant infection, we believe there is no significant gap in the initiation of CMV prevention immediately post-transplant. However, we note gaps in our academic institutions of loss of follow up due to length of therapy (100 days) resulting in increased risk for infection.</p></div>
