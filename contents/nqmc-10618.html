<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Measures in the HEDIS Use of Services domain gather information about how organizations manage the provision of member care and how they use and manage resources. Use of services is affected by many member characteristics, which can vary greatly among organizations, and include age and sex, current medical condition, socioeconomic status and regional practice patterns (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission [MeDPAC], 2007).</p>
<p>This measure assesses the number of all antibiotic prescriptions to enrolled members, as well as antibiotics of concern, to encourage plans to reduce potential overuse, which may contribute to drug resistance.</p></div>
