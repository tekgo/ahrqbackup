Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the number of child and adolescent psychiatrists who have provided any outpatient care to at least one enrolled child, per 1,000 enrolled children.</p>
<p>This rate will be expressed in terms of 1,000 eligible children (number of providers/1,000 enrolled children). The eligible population includes children younger than 18 years of age who have been enrolled in a Medicaid program or health plan that includes outpatient specialty care for at least one 90-day period (or 3 consecutive months) within the measurement year. Specialists are identified by specific taxonomy codes.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Many children have conditions that would benefit from treatment provided by child and adolescent psychiatrists, neurodevelopmental pediatricians, and developmental-behavioral pediatricians. A 2009 review by the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine noted that 14% to 20% of young people experience a mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder at any given point in time and nearly 40% have experienced at least one psychiatric disorder by 16 years of age (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2009). The number of children with disabilities related to mental and neurodevelopmental conditions has increased, even as disabilities related to physical causes in this age group have declined (Houtrow et al., 2014). Most pediatricians consider it appropriate to refer children with suspected developmental or behavioral problems for specialty care (Stein et al., 2008). However, difficulties with access to behavioral or developmental specialty care have been reported by both parents and primary care physicians (Krauss et al., 2003; U.S. Government Accountability Office [GAO], 2011; Steinman et al., 2012).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Prevalence of Mental, Developmental, and Behavioral Conditions among Children</em><br />
Obtaining a general prevalence count for mental, developmental, and behavioral health conditions in children is not simple. Diagnoses may be difficult to determine at the population level, as patients may be seen in a variety of settings that are not billed in a uniform fashion, if at all. It is also common for individuals to have more than one disorder, making it necessary to estimate prevalence for both multiple and individual conditions. A 2009 review by the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine noted that 14% to 20% of young people experience a mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder at any given point in time, and nearly 40% have experienced at least one psychiatric disorder by the age of 16 years (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2009).</p>
<p><em>Severity of Mental Health, Developmental, or Behavioral Conditions among Children</em><br />
Mental health disorders can impose a heavy burden for children. These conditions may be associated with substance use, criminal behavior, and other risk-taking activities (Perou et al., 2013). Frequently, they are linked with additional mental health disorders and other medical conditions. Furthermore, mental health conditions beginning in childhood may continue into adulthood or even lead to suicide (Perou et al., 2013). The overall cost of mental health disorders for young adults has been estimated at $247 billion annually (Perou et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Similarly, developmental disorders cover a wide range of conditions that vary in both severity and prevalence. Recent estimates indicate that nearly 14% of children have some form of developmental disability (Boyle et al., 2011). Autism spectrum disorder is one of the more widely known developmental disorders, characterized by issues with social, emotional, and communication skills. Autism affects 1 out of every 68 children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2015). While autism can be successfully identified in the first 2 to 3 years of life, the disorder itself can last a lifetime and impede an individual's ability to live a normal life (Lord et al., 2006; Matson &amp; Kozlowski, 2011). The toll exacted by developmental and behavioral disorders varies tremendously and may involve other medical conditions. These conditions can increase the risk of developing further behavioral and developmental disorders or other medical complications (Council on Children with Disabilities et al., 2006).</p>
<p><em>Performance Gap</em><br />
Despite the prevalence of these disorders and conditions, treatment utilization lags far behind. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), Merikangas et al. (2010) found that only approximately half of respondents (aged 8 to 15 years old) with a mental disorder had used mental health services in the previous year. Utilization varied by disorder: approximately 48% of adolescents with ADHD used mental health services, while only 32% of those with generalized anxiety disorder did (Merikangas et al., 2010). In a second study, using the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, only an estimated 36% of adolescents (aged 13 to 18 years) with a mental health disorder had ever used mental health services (Merikangas et al., 2011). In the latter study, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black adolescents were less likely than white adolescents to receive services for mood and anxiety disorders, even in cases involving severe impairment (Merikangas et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Similar gaps in treatment have been seen for children with developmental disorders. Despite the importance of early treatment, waiting times in urban areas for pediatric autism evaluations were found to average 3 months, regardless of insurance type (Bisgaier et al., 2011). Others researchers have reported longer wait times for children with Medicaid to access a psychiatrist compared with access times for children with private insurance (Steinman et al., "Children's access," 2012). However, evidence is limited, and some approaches to quantify access require costly data collection methods that may be difficult to implement on a large scale (Steinman et al., "The use," 2012).</p>
<p>Within Medicaid, standards for quantifying access to developmental and behavioral specialty care, as well as to other types of specialty care, vary significantly by state, as do the types of providers measured and the methods of assessing compliance with state access standards (Office of Inspector General, 2014). These issues make it more difficult to compare access across states.</p>
