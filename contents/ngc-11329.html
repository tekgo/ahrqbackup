<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Literature Search</strong></span> </p>
<p>The methods used for this systematic review conformed to those outlined in the article "Methodologies for the Development of CHEST Guidelines and Expert Panel Reports" (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Librarians from the University of Massachusetts Medical School undertook searches to answer the question for acute, subacute, and chronic cough. For chronic cough, articles were identified from searches of electronic databases (PubMed and SCOPUS) commencing from their initiation through February 23, 2016. PubMed was relied on to pick up any Cochrane systematic reviews for chronic cough. For acute and subacute cough, articles were identified from searches of PubMed, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from their initiation through February 23, 2016. The reference lists of retrieved articles were examined for additional citations. The search terms used are presented in e-Tables 1 and 2 in the online supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The titles and abstracts of the search results were independently evaluated by two reviewers to identify potentially relevant articles. The full texts of all potentially relevant articles were retrieved, and two reviewers independently reviewed all retrieved studies. Although a third reviewer was available to adjudicate any disagreements, there were no disagreements. Because a review of articles published before 2006 used a variety of definitions of acute and chronic cough, and subacute cough had not yet been defined, and because the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) management algorithms for cough were not published until 2006, the authors decided to include only articles published in 2006 and afterward in their analysis.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></span></p>
<p>Included articles underwent methodological assessment. Quality assessment was carried out if the articles met the following criteria: (1) they were published during 2006 or later; (2) they defined acute, subacute, or chronic cough (or a combination of the three) based on the duration, as described in the methods sections of the articles, and reported the actual durations in the results sections of the articles; and (3) they reported the spectrum and frequency of causes of cough in the study subjects based on response to treatment as described in the results sections of the articles. For randomized controlled trials, quality assessment was carried out with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. For observational studies, quality assessment was performed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool for cohort studies. For systematic reviews, quality assessment was done with the Documentation and Appraisal Review Tool.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The authors used the published methodology of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guideline Oversight Committee to select the Expert Cough Panel Chair and the International Panel of Experts to perform a systematic review, synthesize evidence, and develop recommendations and practice management suggestions. After generating the key clinical question for this systematic review, Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) elements were derived to inform the literature review. The question was formulated after polling the existing writing group for key clinical questions related to how best to classify cough. The writing committee unanimously chose to focus on the durations of acute, subacute, and chronic cough and how they had been defined in the 2006 Cough Guidelines. The resultant PICO elements that formed the basis of the subsequent systematic review are presented in Table 1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Practice Recommendations/Suggestions</strong></span></p>
<p>The findings of this systematic review were used to support the evidence-graded recommendations or suggestions. A structured consensus-based modified Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on guidance statements. In this regard, for a recommendation or suggestion to be approved by the Expert Cough Panel, 75% of the eligible panel members had to vote, and 80% of those voting had to strongly agree or agree with the statement. In the context of practice recommendations, a strong recommendation applies to almost all patients, whereas a weak recommendation is conditional and applies to only some patients. The strength of recommendation here is based on consideration of three factors: balance of benefits to harms, patient values and preferences, and resource considerations. Harms incorporate risks and burdens to the patients that can include convenience or lack of convenience, difficulty of administration, and invasiveness. These, in turn, impact patient preferences. A patient representative who had been a member of the Cough Panel provided patient-centered input for this guideline and approved of the suggestions contained herein. The resource considerations go beyond economics and should also factor in time and other indirect costs. The authors of these recommendations or suggestions have considered these parameters in determining the strength of the recommendations or suggestions and associated grades.</p></div>
