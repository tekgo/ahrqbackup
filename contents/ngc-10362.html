<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the quality of evidence assessment (<strong>I-III</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>A-E, L</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary and Lifestyle Changes</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about the usefulness of the following: new severe dietary salt restriction for women with any hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), ongoing salt restriction among women with pre-existing hypertension, heart-healthy diet, and calorie restriction for obese women. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about the usefulness of exercise, workload reduction, or stress reduction. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
    <li>For women with gestational hypertension (without preeclampsia), some bed rest in hospital (vs. unrestricted activity at home) may be useful to decrease severe hypertension and preterm birth. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>For women with preeclampsia who are hospitalized, strict bed rest is <strong>not</strong> recommended. (<strong>I-D</strong>) </li>
    <li>For all other women with an HDP, the evidence is insufficient to make a recommendation about the usefulness of some bed rest, which may nevertheless be advised based on practical considerations. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p>The following recommendations apply to women with either pre-existing or gestational hypertension.</p>
<p><strong>Place of Care</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li>In-patient care should be provided for women with severe hypertension or severe preeclampsia. (<strong>II-2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>A component of care through hospital day units or home care can be considered for women with non-severe preeclampsia or non-severe pre-existing or gestational hypertension. (<strong>I-B, II-2B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Antihypertensive Therapy for Severe Hypertension</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="8">
    <li>Blood pressure should be lowered to &lt;160 mmHg systolic and &lt;110 mmHg diastolic. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Initial antihypertensive therapy in the hospital setting should be with nifedipine short-acting capsules, parenteral hydralazine, or parenteral labetalol. (<strong>I-A</strong>) See Table 7 in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>Alternative antihypertensive medications include a nitroglycerin infusion (<strong>I-B</strong>), oral methyldopa (<strong>I-B</strong>), oral labetalol (<strong>I-B</strong>), oral clonidine (<strong>III-B</strong>), or postpartum, oral captopril. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Refractory hypertension may be treated with sodium nitroprusside. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Nifedipine and magnesium sulphate can be used contemporaneously. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Magnesium sulphate is not recommended solely as an antihypertensive agent. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
    <li>Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring is advised until blood pressure is stable. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Antihypertensive Therapy for Non-severe Hypertension <em>Without</em> Comorbid Conditions</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="15">
    <li>Antihypertensive drug therapy may be used to keep systolic blood pressure at 130 to 155 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure at 80 to 105 mmHg. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The choice of antihypertensive agent for initial treatment should be based on characteristics of the patient, contraindications to a particular drug, and physician and patient preference. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Initial therapy in pregnancy can be with one of a variety of antihypertensive agents available in Canada: methyldopa (<strong>I-A</strong>), labetalol (<strong>I-A</strong>), other beta-blockers (acebutolol, metoprolol, pindolol, and propranolol), (<strong>I-B</strong>) and calcium channel blockers (nifedipine). (<strong>I-A</strong>) See Table 8 in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should not be used during pregnancy. (<strong>II-2E</strong>) </li>
    <li>Atenolol and prazosin are not recommended prior to delivery. (<strong>I-D</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For Non-severe Hypertension (BP of 140&ndash;159/90&ndash;109 mmHg) <em>with</em> Comorbid Conditions</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="20">
    <li>For women with co-morbid conditions, antihypertensive drug therapy should be used to keep systolic blood pressure at &lt;140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure at &lt;90 mmHg. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Initial therapy in pregnancy can be with one of a variety of antihypertensive agents as listed for women without co-morbidities. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Captopril, enalapril, or quinapril may be used postpartum, even during breastfeeding. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Corticosteroids for Acceleration of Fetal Pulmonary Maturity</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="23">
    <li>Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be considered for all women who present with preeclampsia at &le;34+6 weeks' gestation. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Antenatal corticosteroid therapy should be considered for women who present at &le;34+6 weeks' gestation with gestational hypertension (despite the absence of proteinuria or adverse conditions) only if delivery is contemplated within the next 7 days. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
    <li>A rescue dose of corticosteroids may be considered for women at &le;34+6 weeks' gestation who remain at high risk of preterm delivery 7 days or more after an initial course of antenatal corticosteroids. (<strong>I-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Antenatal corticosteroids may be considered for women delivered by elective Caesarean delivery at &le;38+6 weeks' gestation to reduce respiratory morbidity. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Timing of Delivery for Women with Preeclampsia</strong></p>
<p>Delivery is the only intervention that initiates resolution of preeclampsia, and women with gestational hypertension or pre-existing hypertension may develop preeclampsia.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="27">
    <li>Consultation with an obstetrician (by telephone if necessary) is mandatory in women with severe preeclampsia. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>All women with severe preeclampsia should be delivered immediately (either vaginally or by Caesarean), regardless of gestational age. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>For women with non-severe preeclampsia at &lt;24+0 weeks' gestation, counselling should include, as an option, information about delivery within days. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>For women with non-severe preeclampsia at 24+0 to 33+6 weeks' gestation, expectant management should be considered, but only in perinatal centres capable of caring for very preterm infants. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>For women with non-severe preeclampsia at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks' gestation, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about the benefits or risks of expectant management. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
    <li>For women with preeclampsia at &ge; 37+0 weeks' gestation, immediate delivery is recommended. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>For women with non-severe preeclampsia complicated by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome at 24+0 to 34+6 weeks' gestation, consider delaying delivery long enough to administer antenatal corticosteroids for acceleration of fetal pulmonary maturity if there is temporary improvement in maternal laboratory testing. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>All women with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome at &ge; 35+0 weeks' gestation should be considered for immediate delivery. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Timing of Delivery for Women with Gestational Hypertension</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="35">
    <li>For women with gestational hypertension (without preeclampsia) at &ge;37+0 weeks' gestation, delivery within days should be discussed. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>For women with gestational hypertension (without preeclampsia) at &lt;37+0 weeks' gestation, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about the benefits or risks of expectant management. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Timing of Delivery for Women with Pre-existing Hypertension</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="37">
    <li>For women with uncomplicated pre-existing hypertension who are otherwise well at &ge;37+0 weeks' gestation, delivery should be considered at 38+0 to 39+6 weeks' gestation. (<strong>II-1B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mode of Delivery</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="38">
    <li>For women with any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, vaginal delivery should be considered unless a Caesarean delivery is required for the usual obstetric indications. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>If vaginal delivery is planned and the cervix is unfavourable, then cervical ripening should be used to increase the chance of a successful vaginal delivery. (<strong>1-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>At a gestational age remote from term, women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with evidence of fetal compromise may benefit from delivery by emergency Caesarean section. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Antihypertensive treatment should be continued throughout labour and delivery to maintain systolic blood pressure at &lt;160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure at &lt;110 mmHg. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The third stage of labour should be actively managed with oxytocin, 5 units intravenous or 10 units intramuscular, particularly in the presence of thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Ergometrine maleate should not be administered to women with any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, particularly preeclampsia or gestational hypertension; alternative oxytocics should be considered. (<strong>II-3D</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Anaesthesia: General Principles</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="44">
    <li>The anaesthesiologist should be informed when a woman with preeclampsia is admitted to the delivery suite. (<strong>II-3B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Early insertion of an epidural catheter (in the absence of contraindications) is recommended for control of labour pain. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>In the absence of contraindications, all of the following are acceptable methods of anaesthesia for women undergoing Caesarean delivery: epidural, spinal, combined spinal-epidural, and general anaesthesia. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>A routine fixed intravenous fluid bolus should not be administered prior to neuraxial anaesthesia. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Anaesthesia: Fluid Administration</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="48">
    <li>Intravenous and oral fluid intake should be minimized in women with preeclampsia, to avoid pulmonary edema. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Fluid should not be routinely administered to treat oliguria (&lt;15 mL/hr for 6 consecutive hours). (<strong>III-D</strong>) </li>
    <li>For treatment of persistent oliguria, neither dopamine nor furosemide is recommended. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
    <li>Phenylephrine or ephedrine may be used to prevent or treat hypotension during neuraxial anaesthesia. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="52">
    <li>Arterial line insertion may be used for continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring when blood pressure control is difficult or there is severe bleeding. (<strong>II-3B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Central venous pressure monitoring is not routinely recommended, and if a central venous catheter is inserted, it should be used to monitor trends and not absolute values. (<strong>II-2D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Pulmonary artery catheterization is not recommended unless there is a specific associated indication (<strong>III-D</strong>), and then only in an intensive care unit setting. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Coagulation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="55">
    <li>Upon admission to delivery suite, women with preeclampsia should have a platelet count done. (<strong>II-1A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Neuraxial analgesia and/or anaesthesia are appropriate in women:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>With preeclampsia, provided there are no associated coagulation concerns (<strong>II-2E</strong>) (see Table 9 in the original guideline document) </li>
        <li>With a platelet count &ge;75 &times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
        <li>Taking low-dose acetylsaliclylic acid in the presence of an adequate platelet count (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
        <li>Receiving unfractionated heparin in a dose of &le;10,000 IU/d subcutaneously, 4 hours after the last dose and possibly immediately after the last dose without any delay (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
        <li>Receiving unfractionated heparin in a dose &gt;10,000 IU/d subcutaneously if they have a normal activated partial thromboplastin time 4 hours after the last dose (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
        <li>Receiving intravenous heparin in a therapeutic dose if they have a normal activated partial thromboplastin time 4 hours after the last dose (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
        <li>Receiving low-molecular-weight heparin 10 to 12 hours after a prophylactic dose, or 24 hours after a therapeutic dose (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Aspects of Care Specific to Women with Pre-Existing Hypertension</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="57">
    <li>Pre-conceptual counselling for women with pre-existing hypertension is recommended. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The following antihypertensive drugs are all acceptable for use in the first trimester of pregnancy: methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be discontinued when planning pregnancy or as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed. (<strong>II-2D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Atenolol should be discontinued when pregnancy is diagnosed. (<strong>I-D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Planned changes in antihypertensive agent(s) for care in pregnancy should be made while the woman is planning pregnancy if the woman has uncomplicated pre-existing hypertension, or, if in the presence of co-morbid conditions, she is likely to conceive easily (within 12 months). (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Aspects of Care for Women with Preeclampsia: Magnesium Sulphate for Preventing or Treating Eclampsia</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="62">
    <li>Magnesium sulphate is recommended for first-line treatment of eclampsia. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Magnesium sulphate is recommended as prophylaxis against eclampsia in women with severe preeclampsia. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Magnesium sulphate may be considered as prophylaxis against eclampsia in women with non-severe preeclampsia but with severe hypertension, headaches/visual symptoms, right upper quadrant/epigastric pain, platelet count &lt;100,000 &times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L, progressive renal insufficiency, and/or elevated liver enzymes, based on cost considerations. (<strong>I-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Magnesium sulphate should be used in standard dosing, usually 4 g intravenous loading dose followed by 1 g/hour. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Routine monitoring of serum magnesium levels is not recommended. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
    <li>Phenytoin and benzodiazepines should not be used for eclampsia prophylaxis or treatment, unless there is a contraindication to magnesium sulphate or it is ineffective. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
    <li>In women with pre-existing or gestational hypertension, magnesium sulphate should be considered for fetal neuroprotection in the setting of imminent preterm birth (within the next 24 hours) at &le;31+6 weeks. (<strong>1-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Delivery should not be delayed in order to administer antenatal magnesium sulphate for fetal neuroprotection if there are maternal and/or fetal indications of emergency delivery. (<strong>III-E</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Aspects of Care for Women with Preeclampsia: Plasma Volume Expansion</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="70">
    <li>Plasma volume expansion is not recommended for women with preeclampsia. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Therapies for Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelets (HELLP) Syndrome</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="71">
    <li>Every obstetrical centre should be aware of the local delay between ordering and receiving platelets units. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>For a platelet count of &lt;20 &times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome, platelet transfusion is recommended regardless of mode of delivery. (<strong>III-B</strong>) See Table 9 in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>For a platelet count of 20 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> to 49 &times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome, platelet transfusion is recommended prior to Caesarean delivery. (<strong>III-B</strong>) See Table 9 in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>For a platelet count of 20 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> to 49 &times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome, platelet transfusion should be considered prior to vaginal delivery if there is excessive active bleeding, known platelet dysfunction, a rapidly falling platelet count, or coagulopathy. (<strong>II-2D</strong>) See Table 10 in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>For a platelet count of &ge;50 &times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome, platelet transfusion and/or packed red blood cells should be considered prior to either Caesarean or vaginal delivery only if there is excessive active bleeding, known platelet dysfunction, a rapidly falling platelet count, or coagulopathy. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The guideline developers do not recommend corticosteroids for treatment of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome until they have been proven to decrease maternal morbidity. (<strong>II-3L</strong>) </li>
    <li>The guideline developers recommend against plasma exchange or plasmapheresis for hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome, particularly within the first 4 days postpartum. (<strong>II-3E</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Care in the 6 Weeks Postpartum</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="78">
    <li>Blood pressure should be measured during the time of peak postpartum blood pressure, at days 3 to 6 after delivery. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women with postpartum hypertension should be evaluated for preeclampsia (either arising de novo or worsening from the antenatal period). (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consideration should be given to continuing antihypertensive therapy postpartum, particularly in women with antenatal preeclampsia and those who delivered preterm. (<strong>II-2L</strong>) </li>
    <li>Severe postpartum hypertension must be treated with antihypertensive therapy to keep systolic blood pressure &lt;160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &lt;110 mmHg. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>In women without co-morbidities, antihypertensive therapy should be considered to treat non-severe postpartum hypertension to keep blood pressure &lt;140/90 mmHg. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women with co-morbidities other than pre-gestational diabetes mellitus should be treated to keep blood pressure &lt;140/90 mmHg (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus should be treated to keep blood pressure &lt;130/80 mmHg. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Antihypertensive agents generally acceptable for use in breastfeeding include the following: nifedipine XL, labetalol, methyldopa, captopril, and enalapril. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>There should be confirmation that end-organ dysfunction of preeclampsia has resolved. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be given postpartum if hypertension is difficult to control, there is evidence of kidney injury (oliguria and/or creatinine &ge;90 &mu;M), or platelets are &lt;50 to 10<sup>9</sup>/L. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Postpartum thromboprophylaxis should be considered in women with preeclampsia, particularly in the presence of other risk factors. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Care Beyond 6 Weeks Postpartum</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="89">
    <li>Women with a history of severe preeclampsia (particularly those who presented or delivered before 34 weeks' gestation) should be screened for pre-existing hypertension and underlying renal disease. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Referral for internal medicine or nephrology consultation (by telephone if necessary) should be considered for women with:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>Postpartum hypertension that is difficult to control </li>
        <li>Women who had preeclampsia and have at 3 to 6 months postpartum, either ongoing proteinuria, decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (&lt;60 mL/min), or another indication of renal disease, such as abnormal urinary sediment (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Women who are overweight should be encouraged to attain a healthy body mass index to decrease risk in future pregnancy (<strong>II-2A</strong>) and for long-term health. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women with pre-existing hypertension or persistent postpartum hypertension should undergo the following investigations (if not done previously) at least 6 weeks postpartum: urinalysis; serum sodium, potassium and creatinine; fasting glucose; fasting lipid profile; and standard 12-lead electrocardiography. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women who are normotensive but who have had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, may benefit from assessment of traditional cardiovascular risk markers. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>All women who have had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy should pursue a healthy diet and lifestyle. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Effects of Maternal Hypertension and Its Therapies on Child Neurobehavioural Development</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="95">
    <li>Clinicians should be aware that gestational hypertension and preeclampsia may each be associated with an increase in adverse paediatric neuro-developmental effects, such as inattention and externalizing behaviours (e.g., aggressiveness). (<strong>II-2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should be reassured that there is no compelling evidence that antihypertensive medications (specifically labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa) are themselves associated with clear adverse neurodevelopmental effects. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Appendix (see Table 10 in the full version of the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) lists tools to support the application of this guideline. Some Web sites provide general information about blood pressure (BP) measurement for non-pregnant patients, but the recommendations are similar enough to those for pregnant women to be useful. Patients, their partners, and their care providers should be well educated about the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and relevant sites are listed.</p>
<p>Implementation of any evidence depends on individual knowledge and beliefs, as well as institutional culture. Strong recommendations should be incorporated into clinical practice. In well-resourced settings, almost all preeclampsia-related maternal deaths involve substandard care.</p>
<p>Some updates to the 2008 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) guidelines on the HDP may require additional effort to implement.</p>
<p>Physicians should consider the category "other HDP" (white-coat and masked hypertension) as part of the classification of hypertensive women and consider using some form of out-of-office BP measurement to evaluate women with non-severe pre-existing or gestational hypertension.</p>
<p>Health care providers should inform pregnant women about the symptoms and signs of the HDPs and refer them to appropriate knowledge translation tools.</p>
<p>The developer recommends the use of corticosteroids for women &le; 34+6 weeks' gestation who are at high risk of delivery within the next seven days. This gestational age cut-off represents a fundamental change in practice that will require discussion.</p>
<p>Physicians should be familiar with the blood bank policies of their own hospital.</p>
<p>Physicians should be aware of postpartum signs of maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and the maternal and perinatal long-term effects of HDPs, especially at this vulnerable time in maternal care when the maternity care provider is often handing back care to the primary care physician.</p>
<p>The reader is reminded to refer to the full open-access guideline published in Pregnancy Hypertension, which contains not only the recommendations presented here, but also all explanatory text and additional references.</p></div>
