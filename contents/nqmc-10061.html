<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There are approximately 1 million emergency department (ED) visits per year for non-traumatic dental conditions in the United States and more than 200,000 visits are made by children (Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits involving dental conditions," 2014; Seu, Hall, &amp; Moy, 2012; Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits with dental conditions among children," 2014). Untreated dental caries (tooth decay) and its sequelae (e.g., dental infections) account for almost 80% of these visits (Seu, Hall, &amp; Moy, 2012; Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits with dental conditions among children," 2014). Dental caries is preventable, and use of the ED for dental caries related conditions results in substantial costs (Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits involving dental conditions," 2014; Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits with dental conditions among children," 2014). Moreover, ED care for dental caries-related conditions is generally not definitive compared to that provided in primary care dental settings and often results in referral to primary care dental sites (Cohen et al., 2011; Hocker et al., 2012; Lewis, Lynch, &amp; Johnston, 2003). This process of care measure can be used to assess if the patient had timely follow-up with a dentist for more definitive care.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure focuses on follow up because care received in the emergency department (ED) for dental problems typically is not definitive. </p>
<p>Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). In 2009 to 2010, 14% of children aged 3 to 5 years had untreated dental caries. Among children aged 6 to 9 years, 17% had untreated dental caries, and among adolescents aged 13 to 15, 11% had untreated dental caries (Dye, Li, &amp; Thorton-Evans, 2012). Untreated dental decay among children has significant short- and long-term adverse consequences (Tinanoff &amp; Reisine, 2009). Among the more significant of these outcomes is emergency department visits for dental caries-related problems (e.g., tooth pain, abscesses). </p>
<p>ED care for dental caries-related problems is generally not definitive compared to that provided in primary care dental settings and often results in referral to primary care dental sites. Studies, using nationally representative ED visit data (including both children and adults) indicate that ED care for dental problems is focused on pain management and infection control for approximately 90% of patients and only 10% of patients have procedures performed in the ED (Lewis, Lynch, &amp; Johnston, 2003; Okunseri et al., 2012). National and state studies indicate that patients presenting to the ED for dental problems are commonly referred to a primary care site for follow-up of their condition (Cohen et al., 2011; Lewis, Lynch, &amp; Johnston, 2003). National and state data suggest that 20% to 25% of patients who visit the ED for a dental-related problem have repeat ED visits for dental problems, and many patients do not have any type of follow-up dental care (Davis, Deinard, &amp; Ma&iuml;ga, 2010; Pajewski &amp; Okunseri, 2012). Dental caries and its sequelae can be reduced through routine clinical oral evaluations, receipt of evidence-based preventive services, and adoption of good oral health habits by patients (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, 2013; Ahovuo-Saloranta et al., 2013; Beauchamp et al., 2008; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2004; Tinanoff &amp; Reisine, 2009; Weyant et al., 2013). </p>
<p>This measure is a process of care measure that can be used to promote improved health outcomes by allowing programs to identify, monitor and increase the percentage of children with a dental caries-related ED visit who subsequently receive outpatient dental care. The high rates of prescription drugs for pain management and infection control and lack of definitive treatment suggests the need for timely definitive care in an outpatient dental setting to avoid ongoing pain, worsening of the dental condition stemming from untreated decay, and repeat ED visits. Definitive dental care occurs primarily in dental practices in the form of advanced management of dental decay. </p></div>
