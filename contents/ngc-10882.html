<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with unresectable stage III and stage IV cutaneous melanoma should undergo BRAF biomarker testing by a College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta accredited laboratory to determine whether they are candidates for a BRAF inhibitor.

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (Patient or Population, Intervention, Comparisons, Outcomes).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Questions</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What types of systemic therapy should be considered for patients with unresectable stage III or metastatic melanoma? </li>
    <li>Should patients be carefully selected; if so by what criteria? </li>
    <li>Which agents should be used as first-line therapy and at what dosing regimen? </li>
    <li>Which agents should be used as second- or third-line therapy and at what dosing regimen? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>Databases were searched for evidence on systemic therapy for unresectable stage III or metastatic cutaneous melanoma and citations were hand-searched to identify additional relevant studies. The initial search strategy and subsequent updates can be found in Appendix B in the original guideline document. Search terms include melanoma and specific types of systemic therapy. The 2015 update included randomized controlled trials, phase III and phase II studies with at least ten patients with advanced, unresectable melanoma. Additional key studies and abstracts were identified by working group members. The National Guidelines Clearinghouse (NGC) and individual guideline organizations were also searched for practice guidelines relevant to this topic.</p>
<p>The search was limited to humans and English from January 2013 to July 2015. 1613 citations were found.</p>
<p><strong>Date of Search</strong>: 07-14-2015</p>
<p><strong>Specific Topic Areas</strong>: Systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic melanoma</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Update Search Strategy</strong>: PubMed and MEDLINE were searched for evidence on systemic therapy for unresectable stage III or metastatic cutaneous melanoma.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion</strong>: Stage III or IV cutaneous melanoma, phase II or III studies, outcomes (overall survival, progression-free survival, tumour response)</p>
<p><strong>Exclusion</strong>: Active brain metastases, uveal, mucosal, or acral melanoma, retrospective studies, phase I studies</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Resource Unit (GURU).

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Tables</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development and Revision History</span></strong></p>
<p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team. Members of the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team include medical oncologists, surgeons, dermatologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, and nurses. Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formulating Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulate the guideline recommendations based on the interpretation of evidence synthesized by the KM Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the GURU handbook, the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the GURU does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Review and Approval</span></strong></p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it is officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Director of Provincial Clinical Teams.</p></div>
