Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the strength of recommendation (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) and strength of evidence (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are positive margins associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR)? Can the use of whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT) mitigate this increased risk?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: A positive margin, defined as ink on ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), is associated with a significant increase in IBTR; this increased risk is not nullified by the use of WBRT. (<strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Strong; <strong>Level of Evidence</strong>: Meta-analysis [patient level] of randomized controlled trials [RCTs] [not primary endpoint]; meta-analysis [study level] of observational studies; individual RCT; <strong>Strength of Evidence</strong>: Strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What margin width minimizes the risk of IBTR in patients receiving WBRT?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Margins of at least 2 mm are associated with a reduced risk of IBTR relative to narrower negative margin widths in patients receiving WBRT. (<strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Moderate; <strong>Level of Evidence</strong>: Meta-analysis [study level] of observational studies; <strong>Strength of Evidence</strong>: Moderate) </li>
    <li>The routine practice of obtaining negative margin widths wider than 2 mm is not supported by the evidence. (<strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Strong; <strong>Level of Evidence</strong>: Meta-analysis [study level] of observational studies; <strong>Strength of Evidence</strong>: Strong) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is treatment with excision alone and widely clear margins equivalent to treatment with excision and WBRT?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: Treatment with excision alone, regardless of margin width, is associated with substantially higher rates of IBTR than treatment with excision and WBRT (even in predefined low-risk patients). (<strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Strong; <strong>Level of Evidence</strong>: Meta-analysis [patient level] of RCTs; individual RCT; <strong>Strength of Evidence</strong>: Strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the optimal margin width for patients treated with excision alone?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: The optimal margin width for treatment with excision alone is unknown, but should be at least 2 mm. Some evidence suggests lower rates of IBTR with margin widths wider than 2 mm. (<strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Moderate; <strong>Level of Evidence</strong>: Meta-analysis [study level] of observational studies; prospective single-arm studies; retrospective studies; <strong>Strength of Evidence</strong>: Moderate)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the effects of endocrine therapy on IBTR? Is the benefit of endocrine therapy associated with negative margin width?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: Rates of IBTR are reduced with endocrine therapy, but there is no evidence of an association between endocrine therapy and negative margin width. (<strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Weak; <strong>Level of Evidence</strong>: RCTs; <strong>Strength of Evidence</strong>: Weak)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should margin widths greater than 2 mm be considered in the presence of unfavorable factors such as comedo necrosis, high grade, large size of DCIS, young patient age, negative estrogen receptor (ER) status, or high risk multigene panel scores?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: Multiple factors have been shown to be associated with the risk of IBTR in patients treated with and without WBRT, but there are no data addressing whether margin widths should be influenced by these factors. (<strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Weak; <strong>Level of Evidence</strong>: Expert opinion; <strong>Strength of Evidence</strong>: Weak)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should margin width be taken into consideration when determining WBRT delivery technique?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: Choice of WBRT delivery technique, fractionation, and boost dose should not be dependent upon negative margin width. There is insufficient evidence to address optimal margin widths for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). (<strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Weak; <strong>Level of Evidence</strong>: Retrospective studies; expert opinion; <strong>Strength of Evidence</strong>: Weak)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should DCIS with microinvasion be considered as invasive carcinoma or DCIS when determining optimal margin width?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: DCIS with microinvasion, defined as no invasive focus &gt;1 mm in size, should be considered as DCIS when considering the optimal margin width. (<strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Weak; <strong>Level of Evidence</strong>: Expert opinion; <strong>Strength of Evidence</strong>: Weak)</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The methods are described in full in the meta-analysis companion to this guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and are summarized briefly below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently extracted data; disagreements were arbitrated by a third investigator.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meta-Analysis </span></strong></p>
<p>Analysis was performed using two different statistical approaches. In the frequentist approach, multiple margin cut points within studies, if reported, were condensed into a single cut point, while the Bayesian approach allowed for the use of multiple cut points. All reported odds ratio (ORs) were adjusted for study-specific median follow up time (to account for the inherent increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence [IBTR] with longer follow up) and are reported relative to positive (or positive/close) margins, or to a minimal negative margin (no ink on tumor or margin &gt;1 mm).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Frequentist Models (Random Effects Logistic Meta-regression)</strong></p>
<p>Margins were dichotomised into positive/close versus negative margin status using one distance threshold per study (&gt;0 or 1 mm; 2 mm; 3 or 5 mm; 10 mm). The association between local recurrence (LR) and margin status and distance was modeled using random effects logistic meta-regression. ORs are presented for negative relative to positive/close margins, and threshold distances relative to &gt;0 or 1 mm.</p>
<p><strong>Bayesian Models (Network Meta-analysis)</strong></p>
<p>Network meta-analysis using mixed treatment comparisons used data from single or multiple thresholds within studies (when presented) to compare directly (within study) and indirectly (between studies) the probability of LR between margins categories (positive; &gt;0 or 1 mm; 2 mm; 3 mm; 10 mm). ORs compare negative versus positive margins, and distance categories relative to positive margins.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Covariates</strong></p>
<p>All models were adjusted for study-level follow up time. Other covariates were assessed for their effect on model estimates (age; median year of recruitment; proportion of patients who received endocrine therapy; proportion with high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); proportion of patients receiving whole breast radiation).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO), American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened a multidisciplinary margins panel (MP) to evaluate ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in relation to margin width. The primary question addressed was "what margin width minimizes the risk of IBTR in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) receiving breast-conserving surgery?"</p>
<p>Committee members were chosen by their respective organizations based upon interest and expertise in DCIS management. Processes recommended in the Institute of Medicine report "Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust" which were followed as part of the guideline development process included: (1) the development of a systematic review/study-level meta-analysis based on questions to be addressed by the MP to serve as the primary evidence base, with additional topic-specific literature reviews conducted by participants for questions not addressed in the meta-analysis; (2) the provision for each recommendation of a rating of the strength of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation; (3) the ascertainment of the level of agreement of panel members with each recommendation by vote, and the revision of recommendations to achieve greater than 90% consensus; and (4) the declaration by MP candidates of potential conflicts of interest before convening, and the obtaining of written disclosures at the consensus meeting.</p>
<p>The MP convened in November 2015; the resulting manuscript was approved by all panel members.</p></div>

Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases.

    <li>There are limitations to this guideline. It applies to patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M) treated with whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT). The findings should not be extrapolated to DCIS patients treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) or those with invasive carcinoma for whom a separate guideline has been developed. While studies including patients treated with and without WBRT were included in the meta-analysis, a meta-analysis of studies of treatment with excision alone was not conducted. Additionally, all of the studies included in the meta-analysis were retrospective. However, in the absence of any planned prospective randomized trials addressing the question of margin width and local recurrence, these studies represent the best available evidence for clinical decision making. </li>
