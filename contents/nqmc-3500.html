Description

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Side Effects of Lithium</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Up to 75&#37; of patients on lithium experience some side effects, but most are minor (polyuria; polydipsia, weight gain, cognitive problems, sedation or lethargy) and can be reduced or eliminated by dose adjustment or dosage schedule.</li>
<li>Tremor affects up to 65&#37; of patients treated with lithium and a severe tremor may be a sign of toxicity. Nausea and diarrhea or blurred vision may also be side effects of toxicity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lithium Levels</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Target lithium levels are generally 0.8-1.1 mmol/L.</li>
<li>Serum concentrations of 0.5 to 1.2 meq/L may be therapeutic according to individual patient response and side effects.</li>
<li>Patients can experience toxic effects with levels above 1.5 meq/L such as marked tremor, nausea and diarrhea, or blurred vision; levels above 2.0 meq/L have been associated with life-threatening side effects, such as neurotoxicity, delirium and encephalopathy.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Monitoring of Serum Lithium Levels</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lithium level monitoring is required due to the medication's narrow therapeutic index.</li>
<li>Check lithium level after initial dosage and after each dosage increase.</li>
<li>It is recommended to obtain serum levels approximately 5 days after a dosage adjustment as this is when the steady state is reached.</li>
<li>Long-term monitoring recommendations are to check every 3 to 6 months in patients with stable lithium levels and whenever the clinical status changes.</li>
</ul></div>
