<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI)</strong>: For a description of what has changed since the previous version of this guidance, refer to Summary of Changes Report &mdash; September 2013 (see the "Guideline Availability" field). In addition, ICSI has made a decision to transition to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system as a method of assessing the quality of evidence and writing recommendations. <strong>This document is in transition to the GRADE methodology.</strong></p>
<p>Transition steps incorporating GRADE methodology for this document include the following: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>All new literature considered by the work group for this revision has been assessed using GRADE methodology. </li>
    <li>Work is being done on placing strengths on recommendations. </li>
</ul>
<p>The recommendations for preventive services for children and adolescents are presented in the form of two tables accompanied by detailed annotations. Four levels of service appear in the Annotation Table, with each service name listed alphabetically within its level. The second table, "Preventive Services Addressed in Alphabetical Order," has been included to facilitate locating a particular service even if the reader does not know which level of service is affiliated with it. The tables are provided in the original guideline document at the ICSI Web site (see the "Guideline Availability" field). Clinical highlights and selected annotations (numbered to correspond with the Annotation Table) follow.</p>
<p>Class of evidence (Low Quality, Moderate Quality, High Quality) and strength of recommendation (Weak or Strong) definitions are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>The work group has prioritized the services included in this guideline; they are ranked by evidence for effectiveness, based upon the sum of their clinically preventable burden and cost effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Level I preventive services</strong>: Clinicians and care systems <em>must</em> assess the need for and recommend these services to every patient. These have the highest value and are worthy of attention at every opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Level II preventive services</strong>: Clinicians and care systems <em>should</em> assess the need for and recommend these services to every patient. These have demonstrated value although less than Level I services, and should be provided whenever possible.</p>
<p><strong>Level III preventive services</strong>: Clinicians and care systems <em>could</em> recommend these services to patients, but only after careful consideration of costs and benefits. These are services for which the evidence of effectiveness is currently incomplete or equivocal, or which may have the potential for significant harm. Providing these services is left to the judgment of individual medical groups, clinicians and their patients. Decisions about preventive services in particular should be made based on the principles of shared decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Level IV preventive services</strong>: These services are <em>not</em> supported by evidence and should not be recommended. They may have insufficient evidence of effectiveness, clear evidence of lack of effectiveness, or the potential for significant harm without any benefit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Highlights</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>All clinic contacts&mdash;whether acute, chronic, or for preventive service&mdash;are opportunities for prevention. Incorporate appropriate preventive services at every opportunity. </li>
    <li>Address or initiate child preventive services that clinicians and care systems <em>must</em> assess the need for and recommend to each patient. These have the highest priority value (Level I). <em>(Annotation Table, Level I Services; Aim #1)</em>

<p><strong>Preventive Services That Clinicians and Care Systems <em>Must</em> Assess the Need for and Recommend to Each Patient. These Have the Highest Priority Value (Level I)</strong></p>
<p>Level I preventive services are worthy of attention at every opportunity. Busy clinicians cannot deliver this many services in any single encounter. However, with systems in place to track whether or not patients are up-to-date with the high-priority preventive services for their age group, clinicians can recommend the high-priority services as opportunities present.</p>

    <li><strong>Childhood Immunizations Series (Level I)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Clinicians must recommend immunizations for infants, children and adolescents for age-appropriate vaccines <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For <strong>recommended immunization schedule for persons Aged 0 through 18 Years</strong> go to <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html" title="CDC Vaccine Web site" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Counseling Messages</strong></p>
    <p>Educate parents to immunize children according to age-appropriate schedule.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li><strong>Chlamydia Screening (Sexually Active Age 25 Years and Younger) (Level I)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Chlamydia infection screening must be offered to all sexually active women aged 25 years and younger <em>[Strong Recommendation, High Quality Evidence]</em> (Meyers, Halvorson, &amp; Luckhaupt, 2007; Johnson et al., 2002). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no evidence regarding optimal frequency of screening, but yearly testing is reasonable (work group consensus).</p>
    <p>Refer to the original guideline document for information on burden of suffering.</p>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>The sensitivity of available screening tests for chlamydia infection is 80% and higher <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend a specific screening test as studies have generally been performed in ideal circumstances in small populations with high prevalence rates. However, they concluded that nucleic acid amplification tests had higher sensitivities and specificities than older antigen detection tests and better sensitivities than culture <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>. Following detection, treatment with antibiotics approaches 100% efficacy. Two randomized studies have observed a decrease in pelvic inflammatory disease following chlamydia screening <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>, <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li><strong>Neonatal Screening (Level I)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Screening in the first week of life for conditions that are initially asymptomatic but that result in serious health issues in the first month of life must be recommended for hemoglobinopathies (Lin &amp; Barton, 2007 <em>[Low Quality Evidence</em>]), phenylketonuria (Mabry-Hernandez, Wolff, &amp; Green, 2008 <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>), and hypothyroidism (Meyers, Halvorson, &amp; Luckhaupt <em>[Systematic Review]</em>) and other conditions according to state law <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>Newborn screening for metabolic and other disorders is designed to detect infants with serious health conditions that are initially asymptomatic like inborn errors of metabolism and hypothyroidism. Early identification in many cases can avert a poor outcome for a child with various interventions, depending on the condition. There is strong evidence to support screening for hemoglobinopathies <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>, phenylketonuria <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>, and hypothyroidism <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. Approximately 4,000 infants per year are identified with a condition through the newborn metabolic screening program. Each state varies on the test required to be done by law, but a uniform approach with all states using mass spectrometry is being promoted by various national groups (<a href="http://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs/newbornscreening/index.html" title="HRSA Web site" target="_blank">http://www.mchb.hrsa.gov/screening</a>). There is fair evidence that false-positive results are not a burden for parents <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. There is fair evidence that screening appears to be cost effective <em>[Cost-Effective Analysis]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Shared Decision-making and Implementation</strong></p>
    <p><em>Counseling messages for effective shared decision-making</em>: All infants should receive a newborn metabolic screening test prior to hospital discharge, ideally when greater than 24 hours of age. Infants who receive screening before 24 hours of age should receive a repeat test before the second week of life.</p>
    <p>System alerts should provide notice of positive results. Appropriate follow-up services must be provided for any child with a positive test.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Preventive Services That Clinicians and Care Systems <em>Should</em> Assess the Need for and Recommend to Each Patient. These Have Value but Less than Those in Level I (Level II)</strong></p>
<p>Level II services have been shown to be effective and should be provided whenever possible. If systems/care management teams are successful in keeping patients on time with high-priority services during illness and disease management visits, preventive services in the second group can be delivered.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
    <li><strong>Breastfeeding Counseling (Level II)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Promotion and support of breastfeeding should be recommended <em>[Strong Recommendation, Low Quality Evidence]</em> (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2008). </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>Breastfeeding promotion interventions have resulted in significantly increased rates of short-term (one to three months) and long-term (six to eight months) exclusive breastfeeding. Additionally, combined pre- and postnatal breastfeeding interventions have a larger effect on breastfeeding durations than either alone. Lay support (peer support or peer counseling) has shown to increase short-term breastfeeding rates <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>Breastfeeding has been shown to decrease the number of ear and gastrointestinal infections. The incidence of asthma, type 2 diabetes and obesity has also been shown to decrease with breastfeeding <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. In the first study to look at the duration of breastfeeding and child maltreatment, the results found the odds ratio for maternal maltreatment decreases as breastfeeding duration increases <em>[Moderate Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Shared Decision-making and Implementation</strong></p>
    <p><em>Counseling Messages for Effective Shared Decision-making</em>:</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Birth-2 years</span></p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Encourage</span>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months, and up to one year </li>
        <li>Supplementing breastfed infants with iron no later than age six months with iron-fortified cereals </li>
        <li>Supplementing for breastfeeding with 400 IU/day vitamin D within two months for infants <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em> </li>
        <li>Pacifier use has not been shown to affect breastfeeding duration or exclusivity <em>[Systematic Review]</em> </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li><strong>Circumcision Counseling (Level II)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Clinicians should routinely present unbiased information to parents and families regarding the potential risks and benefits of circumcision, in a process of shared decision-making.
        <p>While not uniformly recommended, there is evidence that the benefits of infant male circumcision are sufficient to justify health care access and third-party payment to all families desiring the procedure for their infant.</p>
        <p>Often, the decision to have an infant circumcised goes beyond strictly medical considerations, and often reflects religious, cultural or other beliefs, values and preferences <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>Male circumcision may offer protection from infections throughout the life course including urinary tract infections in infants and sexually transmitted infections in adults. In infants, the procedure has a low rate of mild to moderate complications.</p>
    <p>According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Consensus Statement on circumcision <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>, the existing medical evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision, which outweigh risk associated with the procedure. However, data is not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision. They conclude that parents should be given unbiased and accurate information in order to make an informed choice. The potential benefits of circumcision include 1) decreased risk of urinary tract infections in infants <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>; 2) decreased risk of sexually transmitted diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 in adults <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>, <em>[Meta-analysis]</em>); and 3) potential lower risk of penile cancer in adults. The potential risks include 1) bleeding, 2) infection, 3) trauma/injury to the penis, and 4) suboptimal cosmetic result. Complications of circumcision are considerably less when the procedure is performed in the newborn period. Severe complications following circumcision are rare <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses the AAP Policy Statement, as well.</p>
    <p>While there has been no universal consensus regarding infant male circumcision, the World Health Organization (WHO) has made recommendations that emphasize circumcision as an intervention in HIV prevention (<a href="http://www.who.int/en/" title="WHO Web site">http://www.who.int</a>).</p>
    <p><em>Counseling messages for effective shared-decision making</em>: Clinicians should present unbiased information to parents regarding the potential risks and benefits of circumcision.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li><strong>Depression Screening (Level II)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Clinicians and health care systems should try to consistently screen adolescents ages 12 to 18 for major depressive disorder, but only when systems are in place in their organization to ensure accurate diagnosis, careful selection of treatment, and close follow-up <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for depression in children ages 7 to 11.</p>
    <p>There is no evidence about the optimal frequency of screening for any age group <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>The systems needed to provide evidence-based, more effective depression care include evaluation, registry, close follow-up with regular severity score assessment, tracking, treatment intensification, care manager, pre-arranged routine psychiatry consultation, and relapse prevention counseling. Unless these systems are functioning well, benefits from screening are unlikely to be realized.</p>
    <p><strong>Potential Harms to Screening</strong></p>
    <p>There is adequate evidence that treating adolescents with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (especially fluoxetine and citalopram), psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal) and combined therapy decreases major depressive disorder symptoms more than in control subjects. There are at least 18 fair or good-quality randomized controlled trials demonstrating efficacy <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. However, nearly all of these trials have taken place outside a primary care setting, so an assumption is that the very good evidence for efficacy in primary care in adults should apply to adolescents <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. There is inadequate evidence about harms from screening or psychotherapy, but there is convincing evidence for a small risk of increased suicidality from antidepressant treatments and an increased risk of conversion from a unipolar depressive disorder to a bipolar disorder. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force meta-analysis of evidence from nine good-quality randomized control trials found an absolute risk of suicide-related adverse events (suicidal ideation, suicide attempts or preparatory actions for imminent suicide) of about 1% greater than in controls. However, no suicidal deaths occurred among the 2,000 adolescents involved in these trials <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that because of this risk, SSRIs in adolescents "should only be considered if judicious clinical monitoring is possible" <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Shared Decision-making and Implementation</strong></p>
    <p><em>Counseling messages for effective shared decision-making</em>: There is no evidence that simple, brief messages have any effect.</p>
    <p><em>Implementation</em>: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Modified for Adolescents (PHQ-9M) has been validated for diagnosis and screening, as well as tracking depression severity over time, in adolescents ages 12 to 18 <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>

    <li><strong>Folic Acid Chemoprophylaxis Counseling (Level II)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Clinicians should offer to counsel women of reproductive age to consume 400 to 800 micrograms of folic acid per day from food sources and/or supplements <em>[Strong Recommendation, Low Quality Evidence]</em> (Wolff et al., 2009). </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>Neural tube defects are common birth defects that affect approximately 3,000 pregnancies each year <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. The occurrence of neural tube defects is reduced by 50% to 70% with the daily periconceptional consumption of 400 to 800 micrograms of folic acid <em>[Guideline]</em>. Not all women receive adequate levels of folic acid in their diets, and the 2005 March of Dimes Gallup survey indicated the number taking daily supplements is declining. When asked what would motivate them to take a supplement, the most common reported needs were being sick or a clinician's recommendation <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Shared Decision-making and Implementation</strong></p>
    <p><em>Counseling messages for effective shared decision-making</em>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Eat folic acid-rich foods and fortified foods such as dark green leafy vegetables; dried beans and peas; whole grain, fortified enriched grain products and breakfast cereals; and citrus fruits and berries. </li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="8">
    <li><strong>Hearing Screening (Level II)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Universal screening of infants for congenital hearing loss should be recommended before one month of age <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em> (Nelson, Bougatsos, &amp; Nygren, 2008 <em>[Systematic Review]</em>). </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>There is good evidence to recommend newborn hearing screening by otoacoustic emissions and/or auditory brainstem response prior to one month of age <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. Screening for asymptomatic hearing impairment beyond age three is not recommended, although thorough follow-up should be provided for potential cases identified by symptoms or through school-based screening programs <em>[Systematic Review]</em>.</p>
    <p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found good evidence to recommend universal newborn hearing screening. The testing methodology of a one- or two-step validated protocol showed high sensitivity (0.92) and specificity (0.98) for the two-step protocol (otoacoustic emissions followed by auditory brainstem response for those who failed otoacoustic emissions) <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. Screening also improves outcomes <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. Harms of screening in this age group were felt to be minimal.</p>
    <p>After age three, undetected hearing problems are rare, and the majority of cases can be identified by thorough examination of children with otitis media with effusion. There is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of early detection in asymptomatic children <em>[Systematic Review]</em>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="9">
    <li><strong>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Screening (Level II)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>HIV infection screening should be recommended for adolescents and adults ages 15 to 64 <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>HIV infection screening should be recommended earlier than age 15 for adolescents at high risk of infection <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em>.</p>
    <p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific frequency, although screening annually for high-risk individuals and every 3 to 5 years for low-risk individuals seems reasonable (work group consensus). HIV screening should be recommended for all women with every pregnancy <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1.2 million individuals in the United States are living with HIV. On average, 50,000 new cases are confirmed each year, and 50% of newly acquired sexually transmitted infections occur in adolescents and young adults.</p>
    <p>Because it is difficult to reliably identify patients with HIV risk factors, targeted screening misses a significant percentage of the population that may be infected. Statistics indicate that 20% to 25% of individuals are unaware of their HIV status.</p>
    <p>Confirmation of disease and early initiation of treatment significantly decreases burden of the disease, risk of mortality and further disease transmission. Testing methods, including rapid HIV testing and standard serum testing, are &gt;99% sensitive and specific.</p>
    <p>The CDC has recommended universal "opt-out" HIV screening in patients ages 13 to 64 since 2006 <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. More recently, the USPSTF made similar recommendations for adolescents and adults ages 15 to 65, with earlier screening if risk factors are present. While screening may provide only minimal benefit to individual low-risk persons, any harms of testing are also minimal, and, more importantly, the public health benefit of widespread screening, for the population as a whole, is significant <em>[Systematic Review]</em>.</p>
    <p>There is still insufficient evidence to recommend a specific testing interval, but annual testing for higher risk patients, and every 3 to 5 years for lower risk patients, seems reasonable. All women should be tested with every pregnancy.</p>

    <li><strong>Infant Sleep Positioning and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Counseling (Level II)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Clinicians should ask about the child's sleep environment. Inform parents of importance of back-sleeping position. Demonstrate the appropriate sleeping position when the patient is under medical care. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Refer to the original guideline document for information on evidence for effectiveness of SIDS counseling and burden of suffering.</p>
    <p><strong>Shared Decision-making and Implementation</strong></p>
    <p><em>Counseling messages for effective shared-decision making</em>: Infants should be placed on their back for sleep. Side sleeping is no longer recognized as an alternative position.</p>
    <p>Sleep position education should start in the newborn nursery. Health care workers should be careful to place babies on their back to demonstrate to parents the appropriate sleeping position. Continued work to educate all potential caregivers of infants should be supported.</p>
    <p>Infant sleep surfaces should be firm, and there should be no loose bedding or soft objects around the infant.</p>
    <p>Improved room ventilation by use of a fan may be an effective intervention for decreasing SIDS <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>Parents should be encouraged not to smoke, as a no-smoking environment has many important health benefits. Smoking during pregnancy has been shown to be associated with increased risk of SIDS <em>[Guideline]</em>.</p>
    <p>Approximate but separate sleeping environment and the use of pacifiers have been recommended <em>[Guideline]</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Body mass index (BMI) should be calculated and documented in the medical record on all children ages 2 to 18 at least annually <em>[Strong Recommendation, High Quality Evidence]</em> (Barlow &amp; Expert Committee, 2007). </li>

    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Fluoride should be recommended to prevent caries and cavities. A "smear" of fluoridated toothpaste should be recommended for children less than two years of age.

    <li><strong>Tobacco Use Screening, Prevention, and Intervention in Adolescents (Level II)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Clinicians should establish tobacco use status for all patients and reassess at every opportunity (see Annotation #30, "Secondhand Smoke Exposure Counseling [Level III]," in the original guideline document). All forms of tobacco should be included in this assessment. Clinicians should recommend ongoing cessation services to all tobacco users at every opportunity and reinforce non-users to continue avoiding tobacco products <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em>, (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2009 <em>[Systematic Review]</em>; Fiore &amp; Ja&eacute;n, 2008 <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>). </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death and disease in our society. There is some evidence that that school-based programs and family intervention programs may help prevent smoking in children and adolescents <em>[Systematic Review]</em>. There is good evidence that tobacco cessation interventions are best carried out when the entire clinical staff is organized to provide these services <em>[Systematic Review]</em>, <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>Two treatment elements are effective for tobacco cessation intervention in adults: social support for cessation and skills training/problem-solving. The more intense the treatment, the more effective it is in achieving long-term abstinence from tobacco. Structured clinician clinical-based smoking cessation counseling is more effective than usual care in reducing smoking rates in adults <em>[High Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>Refer to the original guideline document for more information on the evidence for effectiveness of tobacco use screening, prevention, and intervention in adolescents.</p>
    <p><strong>Shared Decision-making and Implementation</strong></p>
    <p><em>Counseling Messages for Effective Shared Decision-making</em>:</p>
    <p>For children and adolescents using tobacco:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Emphasize short-term negative effects of tobacco use. </li>
        <li>Advise tobacco users to quit. </li>
        <li>Assess user's willingness to make a quit attempt. </li>
        <li>Provide a motivational intervention if the user is not ready to make a quit effort <em>[Low Quality Evidence]</em>. </li>
        <li>Assist in quitting if ready to make a quit effort. Negotiate a quit date. Counsel to support cessation and build abstinence skills. Offer phone line for more assistance. </li>
        <li>Arrange follow-up to occur soon after the quit date. </li>
        <li>Provide educational and self-help materials for all patients and families. </li>
        <li>Support school and family based programs to help prevent smoking. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="15">
    <li><strong>Vision Impairment Screening (Level II)</strong>
    <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Vision screening should be recommended for all children three to five years of age. Screening should be used to detect amblyopia, strabismus, and defects in visual acuity <em>[Strong Recommendation]</em> (Chou, Dana &amp;, Bougatsos, 2011 <em>[Systematic Review]</em>; Research Triangle Institute et al., 2004 <em>[Systematic Review]</em>). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vision screening could be recommended for children under the age of three <em>[Weak Recommendation]</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Evidence for Effectiveness</strong></p>
    <p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is adequate evidence that early treatment for amblyopia, including the use of cycloplegic agents, patching, and eyeglasses for children three to five years of age leads to improved visual outcomes. The effectiveness of screening in preschool children is supported by indirect evidence that screening is effective in identifying strabismus and amblyopia, treatment of strabismus and amblyopia is effective, and more intensive screening leads to improved visual acuity compared to usual screening <em>[Systematic Review]</em>.</p>
    <p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found inadequate evidence that early treatment of amblyopia for children under the age of three years leads to improved visual outcomes.</p>
    <p>A single randomized control trial demonstrated that children randomized to more intensive screening between 8 and 37 months of age had a lower prevalence of severe amblyopia, and at 7.5 years of age, lower prevalence of amblyopia after treatment <em>[Moderate Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    <p>Refer to the original guideline document for more information on the evidence for effectiveness of vision impairment screening.</p>
    <p><strong>Shared Decision-making and Implementation</strong></p>
    <p><em>Counseling messages for effective shared decision-making</em>: Normal objective vision screening performed at schools need not be repeated by clinics for average-risk, asymptomatic children <em>[Moderate Quality Evidence]</em>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Preventive Services for Which the Evidence Is Currently Incomplete and/or High Burden of Disease and Low Cost of Delivering Care. Providing These Services Is Left to the Judgment of Individual Medical Groups, Clinicians, and Their Patients (Level III)</strong></p>
<p>Level III services either have insufficient evidence to prove their effectiveness and/or have important harms. For these preventive services in particular, decisions about recommending the service should be made based on shared decision making. It is important to remember that insufficient evidence does not mean the service is not effective, but rather that the current literature is not sufficient to say whether or not the service is effective.</p>
<p>Refer to the original guideline document for information on Level III services including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Alcohol use screening and counseling </li>
    <li>Blood lead screening </li>
    <li>Developmental/behavioral assessment screening </li>
    <li>Domestic violence and abuse screening and counseling </li>
    <li>Dyslipidemia screening </li>
    <li>Dysplasia of the hip screening </li>
    <li>Household and recreational injury prevention screening </li>
    <li>Hyperbilirubinemia screening </li>
    <li>Infectious disease prevention counseling </li>

    <li>Sexually transmitted infection counseling </li>
    <li>Skin cancer screening and counseling </li>
    <li>Undescended testicle screening </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preventive Services That Are Not Supported by Evidence and Not Recommended (Level IV)</strong></p>
<p>Level IV services are those with low predictive value and/or uncertain beneficial action for true positives. They may also be a combination of insufficient evidence, potential for harm in treatment, no defined benefit and/or overuse.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>New Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>A work group consisting of 6 to 12 members that includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, other healthcare professionals relevant to the topic, and an Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) staff facilitator develops each document. Ordinarily, one of the physicians will be the leader. Most work group members are recruited from ICSI member organizations, but if there is expertise not represented by ICSI members, 1 or 2 work group members may be recruited from medical groups, hospitals or other organizations that are not members of ICSI. Patients on occasion are invited to serve on work groups.</p>
<p>The work group will meet for 7 to 8 three-hour meetings to develop the guideline. A literature search and review is performed and the work group members, under the coordination of the ICSI staff facilitator, develop the algorithm and write the annotations and literature citations.</p>
<p>Once the final draft copy of the guideline is developed, the guideline goes to the ICSI members for critical review.</p>
<p><strong>Revision Process of Existing Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>ICSI scientific documents are revised every 12 to 24 months as indicated by changes in clinical practice and literature. For documents that are revised on a 24-month schedule, ICSI checks with the work group on an annual basis to determine if there have been changes in the literature significant enough to cause the document to be revised earlier or later than scheduled. For yearly reviewed documents, ICSI checks with every work group 6 months before the scheduled revision to determine if there have been changes in the literature significant enough to cause the document to be revised earlier than scheduled.</p>
<p><em>Literature Search</em></p>
<p>ICSI staff, working with the work group to identify any new pertinent clinical trials, systematic reviews, or regulatory statements and other professional guidelines, conduct a literature search.</p>
<p><em>Revision</em></p>
<p>The work group will meet for 1 to 2 three-hour meetings to review the literature, respond to member organization comments, and revise the document as appropriate.</p>
<p>A second review by members is indicated if there are changes or additions to the document that would be unfamiliar or unacceptable to member organizations. If a review by members is not needed, the document goes to the appropriate steering committee for approval according to the criteria outlined in the "Description of Method of Guideline Validation" field.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Critical Review Process</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of critical review is to provide an opportunity for the clinicians in the member groups to review the science behind the recommendations and focus on the content of the guideline. Critical review also provides an opportunity for clinicians in each group to come to consensus on feedback they wish to give the work group and to consider changes necessary across systems in their organization to implement the guideline.</p>
<p>All member organizations are expected to respond to critical review guidelines. Critical review of guidelines is a criterion for continued membership within Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI).</p>
<p>After the critical review period, the guideline work group reconvenes to review the comments and make changes, as appropriate. The work group prepares a written response to all comments.</p>
<p><strong>Document Approval</strong></p>
<p>Each document is approved by the Committee for Evidence-Based Practice (CEBP).</p>
<p>The committee will review and approve each guideline/protocol, based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The aim(s) of the document is clearly and specifically described. </li>
    <li>The need for and importance of the document is clearly stated. </li>
    <li>The work group included individuals from all relevant professional groups and had the needed expertise. </li>
    <li>Patient views and preferences were sought and included. </li>
    <li>The work group has responded to all feedback and criticisms reasonably. </li>
    <li>Potential conflicts of interest were disclosed and do not detract from the quality of the document. </li>
    <li>Systematic methods were used to search for the evidence to assure completeness and currency. </li>
    <li>Health benefits, side effects, risks and patient preferences have been considered in formulating recommendations. </li>
    <li>The link between the recommendation and supporting evidence is clear. </li>
    <li>Where the evidence has not been well established, recommendations based on community practice or expert opinion are clearly identified. </li>
    <li>Recommendations are specific and unambiguous. </li>
    <li>Different options for clinical management are clearly presented. </li>
    <li>Clinical highlights and recommendations are easily identifiable. </li>
    <li>Implementation recommendations identify key strategies for <em>health care systems</em> to support implementation of the document. </li>
    <li>The document is supported with practical and useful tools to ease <em>clinician</em> implementation. </li>
    <li>Where local resource availability may vary, alternative recommendations are clear. </li>
    <li>Suggested measures are clear and useful for quality/process improvement efforts. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the document has been approved, it is posted on the ICSI Web site and released to members for use.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The information contained in this Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) Health Care Guideline is intended primarily for health professionals and other expert audiences. </li>
    <li>This ICSI Health Care Guideline should not be construed as medical advice or medical opinion related to any specific facts or circumstances. Patients and families are urged to consult a health care professional regarding their own situation and any specific medical questions they may have. In addition, they should seek assistance from a health care professional in interpreting this ICSI Health Care Guideline and applying it in their individual case. </li>
    <li>This ICSI Health Care Guideline is designed to assist clinicians by providing an analytical framework for the evaluation and treatment of patients, and is not intended either to replace a clinician's judgment or to establish a protocol for all patients with a particular condition. </li>
    <li>This guideline is not intended to diagnose or treat any condition; if a health issue or condition is found or suspected, or a screening maneuver is abnormal, other guidelines (such as the "Prevention and Management of Obesity [Mature Adolescent and Adults]" guideline) address the details of subsequent evaluation, testing, and management. </li>
    <li>This guideline is intended to be used primarily by health care organizations to design systems of care for the reliable delivery of preventive services to populations of patients. The various tests included in this guideline are discussed only in the context of screening asymptomatic individuals and the early detection of certain clinical conditions; the work group does not address the use of these tests in patients with symptoms, or for the ongoing management of these conditions. </li>
    <li>While there is good evidence that modifying certain behaviors has positive health benefits (unsafe sex, accidents and safety, nutrition, physical activity), there is minimal evidence at present that screening for these conditions or asking about them in the context of a risk assessment, even if followed by advice from a physician or other clinician, will result in a change in behavior or positive outcomes. Therefore, this guideline makes:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Minimal recommendations for risk assessment to drive counseling for what are largely lifestyle issues </li>
        <li>Specific recommendation that risk assessment and counseling about lifestyle not be considered suitable parameters for systematic implementation measures </li>
        <li>Counseling messages for those clinicians who want to provide such counseling or whose patients express an interest in receiving this information </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Most of the elements of the traditional physical examination are notably absent from these recommendations. The physical examination was originally developed and taught as a way to thoroughly evaluate the patient with a significant health problem or complaint, particularly in the hospital setting. It was not designed as a screening test for an asymptomatic person; in fact, it fails nearly all of the criteria for an effective screening test for an asymptomatic person identified by most authorities. As a diagnostic test, in response to specific complaints or symptoms, the physical exam remains of inestimable, if underutilized value. The only elements of the physical exam that have been sufficiently studied and are recommended by this guideline are height, weight and body mass index as part of obesity screening (Level II), vision screening (Level II) and hearing screening (Level II). There is incomplete evidence and/or high burden of disease and low cost of delivery care for Level III services, and these are left to the judgment of individual medical groups, clinicians and their patients. There is no evidence that cardiopulmonary, abdominal or neurologic exams, done as routine screening maneuvers in asymptomatic patients, will reliably detect occult disease of any type. The work group recognizes the real and intangible benefits, as well as parental expectations, inherent in examining a child or adolescent, but cautions against assuming that all patients expect or want a physical exam as a part of routine preventive services. </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend one schedule over another in terms of lowering mortality and morbidity; recognizing disability; promoting optimal growth and development; or helping patients achieve longer, more productive lives. Many services can be provided during routine visits. Similarly, an assessment of preventive services needs can be incorporated into any visit. The visit schedules recommended in these guidelines may augment a clinic's ability to assure provision of preventive services, but this may be unnecessary over time as effective clinic systems allow the services to be incorporated into other clinic visits. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Once a guideline is approved for general implementation, a medical group can choose to concentrate on the implementation of that guideline. When four or more groups choose the same guideline to implement and they wish to collaborate with others, they may form an action group.</p>
<p>In the action group, each medical group sets specific goals they plan to achieve in improving patient care based on the particular guideline(s). Each medical group shares its experiences and supporting measurement results within the action group. This sharing facilitates a collaborative learning environment. Action group learnings are also documented and shared with interested medical groups within the collaborative.</p>
<p>Currently, action groups may focus on one guideline or a set of guidelines such as hypertension, lipid treatment, and tobacco cessation.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Prior to implementation, it is important to consider current organizational infrastructure that address the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>System and process design </li>
    <li>Training and education </li>
    <li>Culture and the need to shift values, beliefs and behaviors of the organization&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>The following system changes were identified by the guideline work group as key strategies for health care systems to incorporate in support of the implementation of this guideline.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Prioritization and implementation of preventive services should be part of the overall system and should include the following:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Practice preventive services at every clinic opportunity while addressing high-priority services. </li>
        <li>Individualize preventive services; regularly assess patient risk factors. </li>
        <li>Provide education to patients/parents/guardians. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Develop a plan for staff and clinician education around preventive services and organizational goals for implementation of preventive services (should also include education around "level" of service and the rationale behind each level). </li>
    <li>Develop decision support processes in electronic medical record or for paper medical records to support clinicians and staff in delivery of specific components of Level I services. </li>
    <li>For those organizations with a paper medical record, create a "tickler" system that will generate reminders for preventive services in order to support completion of recommended Level I services. </li>
    <li>Develop a "catch-up" plan for those patients who are not on time with services by creating a tracking system that allows for periodic medical record audits to identify patient gaps in preventive services. </li>
    <li>Develop a collaborative relationship with patients/parents/guardians in order to activate/motivate them to practice preventive health while staying on time. </li>
    <li>Place throughout the facility patient education materials that focus on preventive services and the importance of each. Materials may include, but are not limited to, posters, pamphlets, videos and available Web sites, as well as services available in the community. </li>

This committee has adopted the Institute of Medicine Conflict of Interest standards as outlined in the report Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2011).</p>
<p>Where there are work group members with identified potential conflicts, these are disclosed and discussed at the initial work group meeting. These members are expected to recuse themselves from related discussions or authorship of related recommendations, as directed by the Conflict of Interest committee or requested by the work group.</p>
<p>The complete ICSI policy regarding Conflicts of Interest is available at the <a href="https://www.icsi.org/_asset/fwsfmi/coi_policyletter.pdf" title="ICSI Web site">ICSI Web site</a>.</p>
