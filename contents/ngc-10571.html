<p><em>Searches</em></p>
<p>Bibliographic databases including MEDLINE (1980 onwards and In process and other non-indexed citations), EMBASE (1980 onwards) and the Cochrane Library (1980 onwards) were searched on 22 October 2012. These searches were updated in October 2013 to identify additional published studies of relevance to the submission. No strategies for identifying ongoing studies are provided in the manufacturer's submission (MS). For all databases, a combination of free text and index terms were appropriately used.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion Criteria</em></p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the original systematic review (October 2012) are presented in detail in the MS (Table 3). The criteria for the updated review are summarised in the table below. In addition to the interventions and comparators specified by NICE, it is noted that trametinib, ipilimumab and fotemustine were also included. It is stated that these interventions were identified from clinical practice or from ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The ERG notes that as of October 2013, both dabrafenib monotherapy and dabrafenib + trametinib (dual therapy) were included in the NICE appraisal process.</p>

<p><em>Objective of the Manufacturer's Cost-effectiveness Literature Review</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer's search was designed to capture economic literature which focussed on treatments for metastatic melanoma. The initial searches were conducted on 10 April 2012 and were updated on the 24 and 25 October 2013. The databases were searched from start of database (1960) to 24/25 October 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Summary of the ERG's Critique of Cost-effectiveness Evidence Submitted</strong></p>
<p>The ERG is satisfied with the search strategy employed by the manufacturer to identify cost effectiveness studies, and is reasonably confident that no other relevant published articles exist. In addition, the ERG agrees with the manufacturer's view that there is insufficient evidence to facilitate the development of an economic case for previously treated (second-line) patients.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>One study (BREAK-3) was the only identified trial that examined the effects of dabrafenib; therefore, it was considered to be the key trial of interest. Supporting evidence was also provided from four other studies, none of which were used in quantitative analyses. Figure 3 in the manufacturer's submission (MS) shows a flow diagram of the numbers of studies included and excluded at each stage of the review process (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Nine cost-effectiveness studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review but only one was deemed relevant by the manufacturer for discussion. In addition, the manufacturer identified one relevant National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) single technology appraisal, "Vemurafenib for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic BRAF v600 mutation-positive malignant melanoma (NICE technology appraisal 269)." </li>
    <li>The manufacturer submitted an economic model. </li>

<p><strong>Critique of the Methods of Review(s)</strong></p>
<p><em>Data Extraction</em></p>
<p>Details of the data extraction strategy are reported in the manufacturer's submission (MS) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Data from the included studies were appropriately extracted in parallel by two independent reviewers with any differences considered and reconciled by a third reviewer. Where more than one identified publication described a single trial, data were appropriately compiled into a single entry in the data extraction table to avoid the double counting of patients. The types of data extracted appear to be comprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>A descriptive critical appraisal of all the included studies was conducted using comprehensive assessment criteria based on the recommendations in the NICE Single Technology Assessment (STA) guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>All trials identified by the systematic review had different interventions and comparators and therefore it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis. Findings were appropriately presented narratively. In addition, to compare interventions to comparators specified in the NICE scope, the manufacturer undertook an indirect treatment comparison (ITC).</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Manufacturer's Economic Modelling</strong></p>
<p><em>Description of Manufacturer's Economic Model</em></p>
<p>A schematic of the manufacturer's model is provided in the MS and reproduced in Figure 2 in the ERG report. It comprises three health states described as progression-free, post progression and death. All patients enter the model in the 'progression-free' health state and are at risk of disease progression or death over time. Patients who progress are assumed to discontinue therapy, move to the 'Post progression' health state and stay in that health state until death. The model has been developed in Microsoft Excel and employs a 1-week cycle length.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Perspective, Time Horizon and Discounting</span></p>
<p>The manufacturer states that the economic appraisal is undertaken from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). Outcomes are expressed in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and life-years gained. The time horizon is set at 30 years and, in line with the NICE Methods Guide to Technology Appraisal, both costs and outcomes are discounted at 3.5%.</p>
<p>Refer to sections 5 and 6 in the ERG report for more information on cost-effectiveness assessment.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee did not consider the cost-effectiveness of dabrafenib compared with dacarbazine, having noted that dacarbazine was not an appropriate comparator as it was no longer used in clinical practice. It restricted its cost-effectiveness discussion to the comparison with vemurafenib.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) concerns regarding the structure of the model; in particular, the way the company modelled the clinical effectiveness estimates using a 3-stage approach, resulting in survival curves that did not appear clinically plausible. The Committee also noted the ERG's concerns with the company's indirect comparison and noted that the ERG had not carried out exploratory analyses of the clinical or cost effectiveness of dabrafenib compared with vemurafenib.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>Treatment-specific EuroQoL EQ-5D utility data for pre-progression and post-progression, derived directly from BREAK-3, were used in the model for dabrafenib and dacarbazine. In the absence of comparable EQ-5D utility data for vemurafenib, the company assumed that the vemurafenib utility values would be the same as those for dabrafenib.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>
<p>Not applicable</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The company conducted a series of deterministic sensitivity analyses. For the comparison of dabrafenib with dacarbazine, overall survival was the key driver of the cost-effectiveness results.</p>
<p>The key driver of the cost-effectiveness result for the comparison of dabrafenib with vemurafenib was the progression-free survival assumption.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio [ICER])</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the company's base case ICER was &pound;11,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for dabrafenib compared with vemurafenib, but was much lower than this if a class effect was assumed for dabrafenib and vemurafenib. In the absence of any further numerical analysis by the ERG, the Committee could not give an estimate of the most plausible ICER for the comparison of dabrafenib with vemurafenib.</p></div>

    <li>This guidance represents the views of the National Institute for
    Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and was arrived at after careful
    consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are
    expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical
    judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual
    responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate
    to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
    the patient and/or guardian or carer. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local
    commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded
    that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
    local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need
    to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity
    and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be
    interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with
    those duties. </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy

<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Section 7(6) of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/259/contents/made" title="UK Legislation Web site">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013</a> requires clinical commissioning groups, National Health Service (NHS) England and, with respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the recommendations in this appraisal within 3 months of its date of publication. </li>
    <li>When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraph above. This means that, if a patient has unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that dabrafenib is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. </li>
    <li>The Department of Health and the company have agreed that dabrafenib will be available to the NHS with a patient access scheme that makes dabrafenib available with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the responsibility of the company to communicate details of the discount to the relevant NHS organisations. Any enquiries from NHS organisations about the patient access scheme should be directed to the manufacturer's customer contact centre on 0800 221 441. </li>
    <li>NICE has developed a <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA321/costing" title="NICE Web site">costing statement</a> explaining the resource impact of this guidance (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </li>
