<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 2 to 20 years of age who had at least one dental visit during the measurement year. This measure applies only if dental care is a covered benefit in the organization's Medicaid contract.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The average American adult has between 10 and 17 decayed, missing or filled permanent teeth. About half of all adults have gingivitis (gum inflammation) and 80 percent have experienced some degree of destruction of the bone supporting the teeth.</p>
<p>Tooth decay is the most common disease known to man. The number of cavities in school-age children has been declining since the 1940s, yet the average child still has at least:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>1 cavity in permanent teeth by age 9 </li>
    <li>2.6 cavities in permanent teeth by age 12 </li>
    <li>8 cavities in permanent teeth by age 17 </li>
</ul>
<p>Guidelines set by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) (2002), the American Dental Association (ADA) ("Baby's first teeth," 2002) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (Hale, 2003) recommend the first dental visit occur for children by one year of age. Regular visits to the dentist provide access to cleaning, early diagnosis and treatment, as well as education on how to prevent problems.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Dental caries (cavities) is one of the most common, preventable childhood diseases (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research [NIDCR], 2000). Regular dental visits provide access to cleaning, early diagnosis and treatment, as well as to education about caring for teeth to prevent problems. Approximately 25 percent of our nation's children have multiple cavities, and tooth decay is the major cause of tooth loss in children (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry [AAPD], 2014). </li>
    <li>Every year in the United States, there are about 500 million visits to the dentist. In 2010, an estimated $108 billion was spent on dental services for oral health problems (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [NCCDPHP], 2011). </li>
    <li>Dental caries remains the most common chronic disease of children and it is four times more common than asthma among adolescents (NCCDPHP, 2013). </li>
    <li>Oral health is essential to overall health. Dental diseases have a detrimental effect on quality of life in childhood and in older age (World Health Organization [WHO], 2003). Annual dental visits and oral care during infancy and continued throughout childhood and adolescence can significantly reduce the risks of developing oral disease (Dye et al., 2007). </li>
</ul>
