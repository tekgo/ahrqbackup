<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 through 80 years with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage III colon cancer who are referred for adjuvant chemotherapy, prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy, or have previously received adjuvant chemotherapy within the 12-month reporting period.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy in American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage III colon cancer patients following primary surgical treatment is associated with a significant survival benefit. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statement</strong></p>
<p>For patients with Stage III disease, the panel recommends 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy after primary surgical treatment. The treatment options are: FOLFOX or CapeOx; FLOX; or single-agent capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil (FU)/leucovorin (LV) in patients for whom oxaliplatin therapy is believed to be inappropriate (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2015).</p>
<p>A shortage of LV recently existed in the United States. No specific data are available to guide management under these circumstances, and all proposed strategies are empiric. The panel recommends several possible options to help alleviate the problems associated with this shortage. One is the use of levoleucovorin, which is commonly used in Europe. A dose of 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of levoleucovorin is equivalent to 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of standard LV. Another option is for practices or institutions to use lower doses of LV for all doses in all patients, because the panel feels that lower doses are likely to be as efficacious as higher doses, based on several studies. Finally, if none of the above options is available, treatment without LV would be reasonable. For patients who tolerate this without grade II or higher toxicity, a modest increase in 5-FU dose (in the range of 10%) may be considered (NCCN, 2015).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a measure testing project in 2011 with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), to ensure <em>Colon Cancer: Chemotherapy for AJCC Stage III Colon Cancer Patients </em>measure was reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator and denominator case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing chart data. Inter-rater reliability was tested. Five sites participated in the testing of the measures. Two sites were in urban settings, two sites were in suburban settings, and one had multiple practice sites in urban, rural and suburban settings. Site A was a hospital-based practice with 21 physicians. Site B was a physician-owned private practice with four physicians. Site C was a physician-owned private practice with 41 physicians. Site D was an academic practice with nine physicians. Site E was an academic practice with 14 physicians.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from chart records were used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the measures. </p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Colon Cancer: Chemotherapy for AJCC Stage III Colon Cancer Patients</em></p>
<p>There were 160 observations from five sites used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide-by-zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used. </p>
<p>Of the 160 observations that were initially selected, 160 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide-by-zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval)</span><br />
Denominator: 160, 100.00%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)*<br />
Numerator: 160, 100.00%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)*<br />
Exceptions: Not applicable, Not applicable, Not applicable</p>
<p>This measure demonstrates perfect reliability, as shown in results from the above analysis. </p>
<p class="Note">*Cannot calculate kappa statistics when only one response (Yes/Yes) was used, as this causes a divide-by-zero error in the statistic formula.</p>
<p><strong>Signal-to-Noise Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>For this measure, the reliability at the minimum level of quality reporting events (10) was 0.82. The average number of quality reporting events for physicians included is 80.7. The reliability at the average number of quality reporting events was 0.97. </p>
<p>This measure has high reliability when evaluated at the minimum level of quality reporting events and high reliability at the average number of quality events.</p></div>
