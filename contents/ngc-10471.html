<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the grading of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Weak, Further research needed</strong>) and quality of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low, Very Low</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Is Ethanol Lock Effective in Preventing Bloodstream Infection and Catheter Removal in Children at Risk of Parenteral Nutrition&ndash;Associated Liver Disease (PNALD)?</strong></p>
<p>A suggestion is made to use ethanol lock to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and to reduce catheter replacements in children at risk of PNALD.</p>
<p><em>Evidence</em>: <strong>Low and very low</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation Grade</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Fat Emulsion Strategies Can Be Used in Pediatric Patients with Intestinal Failure to Reduce the Risk of or Treat PNALD?</strong> </p>
<p>Since the only intravenous (IV) fat emulsion available for use in the United States is soy-based fat emulsions (SOE), a suggestion is made to reduce the dose of SOE to &le;1 g/kg/d to treat cholestasis in children with PNALD. The quality of evidence supporting this recommendation is very low. Most studies are small observational studies. The desirable effect of reduction of liver indices has to be considered in light of the unknown effects of poor growth and development when lipids are restricted.</p>
<p><em>Evidence</em>: <strong>Very Low</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation Grade</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p>Fish oil emulsion (FOE) is available in the United States under a compassionate use protocol. Until it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), no recommendation can be made for use in the United States. The evidence supporting the use of FOE is very low quality. Included studies are small observational studies that are confounded by concurrent lipid dose reduction and advancement of enteral feedings. The desirable effect of improved cholestasis has to be considered in light of the unknown effects of poor growth and development when lipids are restricted.</p>
<p><em>Evidence</em>: <strong>Further research needed</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: <strong>No recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Fat emulsion with soy oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil (SMOF) is not available in the United States. Until it is approved for use, no recommendation can be made for use in the United States. If available, the evidence supporting the use of SMOF for the treatment of cholestasis is very low quality. The randomized control trials (RCTs) are primarily safety and efficacy studies in preterm infants with the primary outcome of plasma phospholipid profiles and adverse events.</p>
<p><em>Evidence</em>: <strong>Further research needed</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: <strong>No recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Fat emulsions that contain a blend of refined olive and soybean oil have been approved for adults receiving parenteral nutrition (PN). It is not approved for infants or children. Until it is approved for use in children, no recommendation can be made for use in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Can Enteral Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA) Improve the Treatment of PNALD in Pediatric Patients with Intestinal Failure?</strong></p>
<p>A suggestion is made to use UDCA for the treatment of elevated liver enzymes in children with PNALD. The evidence is of very low quality and confounded with the presence of enteral feeding in conjunction with treatment with UDCA. In addition, the patients studied tend to be premature infants with an intact intestinal tract; therefore, the efficacy of UDCA may not be generalizable to patients with established intestinal failure. In the included studies, no harm from this treatment was reported. The desirable effect of the reduction of liver indices has to be weighed against the unknown efficacy of the treatment and the fact that in most cases, the study participants did not have primary intestinal pathology.</p>
<p><em>Evidence</em>: <strong>Very low</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>Are PNALD Outcomes Improved When Patients Are Managed by a Multidisciplinary Intestinal Rehabilitation Team?</strong></p>
<p>A suggestion is made to refer patients with PN-dependent intestinal failure to multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation programs. The evidence on this topic is of very low quality, but the improvement in survival is compelling, and the risk to the child of treatment with multidisciplinary practice is not increased.</p>
<p><em>Evidence</em>: <strong>Very low</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>

<p>The A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Guidelines process has adopted concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. A full description of the methodology has been published (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Briefly, specific clinical questions where nutrition support is a relevant mode of therapy are developed and key clinical outcomes are identified. A rigorous search of the published literature is conducted, and each included study is assessed for research quality, tables of findings are developed, and the body of evidence for the question is evaluated. A recommendation for clinical practice that is based on both the best available evidence and the risks and benefits to patients is developed by consensus. Strong recommendations are made when the evidence is graded high and/or net benefits outweigh harms. Weak recommendations are made when evidence is graded low or if there are important trade-offs to the patient. When limited research is available to answer a question, no recommendation can be made.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>These American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Clinical Guidelines are based on general conclusions of health professionals who, in developing such guidelines, have balanced potential benefits to be derived from a particular mode of medical therapy against certain risks inherent with such therapy. However, the professional judgment of the attending health professional is the primary component of quality medical care. Since guidelines cannot account for every variation in circumstances, the practitioner must always exercise professional judgment in their application.
