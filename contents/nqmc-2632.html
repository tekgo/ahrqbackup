<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess functional status of patients who received outpatient rehabilitation through the use of self-report health status questionnaires. Because the measures are taken at intake, during, and at discharge from rehabilitation, change in functional status can be assessed. Measure results are available in Outcomes Profile Reports, which provide 1) information for clinicians to help direct and improve the care of their patients in real time during treatment, and once treatments are complete, 2) a comparison of the clinician's or facility's outcomes and the National Aggregate in the FOTO&#174; Database.</p>   </div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Collection of outcomes following clinical treatment is now commonplace in rehabilitation. (Hart 2002) Clinicians use outcomes to track changes in their patients to assess if the patient is improving with a specific treatment, (Jette & Delitto 1997) if treatment needs to be changed or terminated, (Jette & Jette 1997) and if the patient needs to be referred to another clinician or service. (Jette & Jette 1997) Administrators use outcomes to compare their department's success with other similar departments, to market the department's services, to manage resources required to deliver their clinical services, and to manage their clinicians. (Marino 1997) Researchers analyze outcomes data for a variety of reasons including directing clinical education needs of providers, identifying clinical experts, etc. (Resnik & Hart 2003) The federal government has mandated the collection of outcomes for post-acute rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes and in patient rehabilitation hospitals, and the government has directed the development of patient assessment instruments designed to collect outcomes in outpatient clinics. (Johnson 2001)</p>
 
<p>The process of outcomes management is evolving, and now many consider collection of functional status and health and well being the gold standard of outcomes measurement. Patient self-report of health status instruments, which quantify the client's perception of their functional abilities and health and well-being in standardized terms, have been recommended as outcomes tools for effectiveness research studies in rehabilitation. Standardized functional health status measures facilitate assessment of quality and value of clinical care. (Hart 2001)</p></div>

Incidence/Prevalence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Musculoskeletal impairments account for a larger percentage of conditions for which medical care is sought in the United States (U.S.), and a large proportion of the cost associated with this care is related to the disability caused by these impairments. In 1984, Cunningham and Kelsey reported the overall prevalence of musculoskeletal impairments using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I. In the U.S., 32.6&#37; of persons between the ages of 25 and 74 years were affected by some type of physician-observed musculoskeletal impairment, and 29.7&#37; of the population had self-reported musculoskeletal impairments. Impairments related to the spine had the highest prevalence. In the National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES), about 20&#37; of the 1980 noninstitutionalized population reported having a musculoskeletal problem involving the back or joints that resulted in some type of disability or use of the health care system.</p>

<p>Out of 318,427 patients who were treated for orthopedic impairments in 2000-2002 in 552 outpatient rehabilitation clinics participating in the FOTO outcomes process in 40 states, 3.6&#37; had hip impairments, 14.6&#37; had knee impairments, and 6.4&#37; had foot/ankle impairments. From a utilization perspective, they received 9.7<u>+</u>7.7 (mean, SD) visits (range 2 to 100 visits) over 36.4<u>+</u>31 (mean, SD) calendar days duration (range 2 to 365 days).</p></div>

<h2>Evaluation of Measure Properties

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Lumbar Functional Status measure uses an ever expanding item bank of lumbar functional status items originally developed by co-calibrating 28 items from the Back Pain Functional Scale (Stratford et al 2000), PF-10 of the SF-36 (Ware et al 1993), items for lower functioning (Hart & Wright 2002) and items for upper extremity functioning (Hart 2000). Three items were deleted because factor analytic and model testing results did not support keeping them. The unidimensionality and local independence of the remaining 25 items and the hierarchical structure, content validity, person reliability and separation were supported. The functional status measure generated using the computerized adaptive testing process were 72&#37; more efficient than using all 25 items, and the known group construct validity of the computerized adaptive test (CAT) measures was supported. Internal consistency reliability was supported as well. Studies are ongoing to expand the item bank by adding more condition-specific items designed to increase or maintain measure precision while reducing respondent burden.</p></div>
