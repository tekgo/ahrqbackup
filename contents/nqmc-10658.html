<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, who undergo a surgical procedure under anesthesia who have documentation that all applicable safety checks from the World Health Organization (WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist were performed before induction of anesthesia.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) Safe Surgery Saves Lives Study Group published a study showing that utilization of a surgical safety checklist resulted in reduced perioperative mortality and complication rates. Since then, surgical safety checklists have been widely implemented around the world. Further studies confirm the WHO findings that implementation of the surgical safety checklist improves communication among members of the surgical team and reduces perioperative morbidity and mortality. </p>
<p>While the number of surgery-related sentinel events has decreased over the past several years, operative care still remains one of the top ten root causes for sentinel events. To address patient safety concerns in the operating room, surgical safety checklists have been widely implemented in recent years. However, compliance with surgical safety checklists and safety checklist protocols has been shown to vary widely. The level of checklist compliance has been shown to vary depending on the implementation strategy. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>:</p>
<p>WHO Guidelines for Safe Surgery (2009)</p>
<p>The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist reinforces established safety practices and ensures beneficial preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative steps are undertaken in a timely and efficient way. Introducing key safety elements into the operating routine, teams could maximize the likelihood of the best outcome for all surgical patients without placing an undue burden on the system or the providers.</p></div>
