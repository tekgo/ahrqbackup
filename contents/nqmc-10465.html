Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have been managed by corticosteroids greater than or equal to 10 mg/day of prednisone equivalents for 60 or greater consecutive days or a single prescription equating to 600 mg prednisone or greater for all fills that have been prescribed corticosteroid sparing therapy within the last 12 months.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Thirty to forty percent of patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have steroid dependent disease. That means that they are unable to taper off steroids without experiencing a flare up (Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America [CCFA], 2009). A retrospective study examined whether the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) with immunosuppressant medications was associated with an increased risk of death prior to anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) therapies. The authors found that patients with both CD and UC are at increased risk of death during periods of current corticosteroid use. In contrast, current treatment with thiopurines was not associated with an increased risk of death (Lewis et al., 2008). Similar findings were reached after an additional 5 years of follow-up in this patient population using multivariate logistic regression analyses which demonstrated a significant increase in mortality risk associated with chronic corticosteroid therapy, Hazard Ratio-2.14 (Lichtenstein et al., 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>: </p>
<p>Long-term treatment with corticosteroids is undesirable. Patients with chronic active corticosteroid-dependent disease (either CD or UC) should be treated with azathioprine (AZA) 2.0 to 3.0 mg/kg/day or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/day in an effort to lower or preferably eliminate corticosteroid use. Infliximab is another option in this situation, as is combination infliximab/antimetabolite therapy (Lichtenstein et al., "Corticosteroids," 2006).</p>
<p>Individual patients with either CD or UC who experience a severe flare of disease requiring corticosteroid treatment or require retreatment during the year with another course of corticosteroids should be considered for initiation of therapy with AZA 2.0 to 3.0 mg/kg/day or 6-MP 1.1 to 1.5 mg/kg/day in an effort to avoid future corticosteroid use. Infliximab is another option in this situation, as is combination infliximab/antimetabolite therapy (Lichtenstein et al., "Corticosteroids," 2006). </p>
<p>Conventional corticosteroids are not efficacious in maintenance treatment of patients with CD or patients with UC (Lichtenstein et al., "Corticosteroids," 2006).</p>
<p>Corticosteroids should not be used to maintain remission (Travis et al., 2006).</p>
<p>Conventional corticosteroids should not be used as long-term agents to prevent relapse of CD. Budesonide at a dose of 6 mg/day reduces the time to relapse in ileal and/or right colonic disease, but does not provide significant maintenance benefits after 6 months. Azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate have demonstrable maintenance benefits after inductive therapy with corticosteroids (Lichtenstein et al., 2009).</p>
<p>This is the first report from the TREAT Registry, a large, prospective, observational research program designed to address the long term safety of medications, including infliximab, for the treatment of CD. After adjustment for confounding factors including disease severity and the use of other medications, the risk for serious infection or death with infliximab use was similar to that observed with the use of conventional immunomodulators, and was not higher than the overall incidence of serious infections among all CD patients. </p>
<p>The use of prednisone was a strong independent risk factor for both serious infection and death. Likewise, the use of narcotic analgesics also was associated with a significantly increased risk for serious infection (Lichtenstein et al., "Serious infections," 2006) Additionally, recently published American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines for Crohn's disease recommend using anti-TNF [tumor necrosis factor] alpha drugs to induce remission in patients with moderately severe Crohn's disease (Terdiman et al., 2013).</p></div>
