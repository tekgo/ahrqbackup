Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the average score for the "Clinical Information Systems" subscale on the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) Survey, for care provided to all patients with one or more chronic conditions.</p>
<p>Respondents (practice teams, health plan representatives) rate the degree to which each of the following components are being implemented within their system for care provided to all patients with one or more chronic conditions, using a scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 11 (fully). </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Registry (list of patients with specific conditions) </li>
    <li>Reminders to Providers </li>
    <li>Feedback </li>
    <li>Information about Relevant Subgroups of Patients Needing Services </li>
    <li>Patient Treatment Plans </li>
</ul>
<p>The ACIC is organized such that the highest "score" (an "11") on any individual item, subscale, or the overall score (an average of the seven ACIC subscale scores) indicates optimal support for chronic illness. The lowest possible score on any given item or subscale is a "0", which corresponds to limited support for chronic illness care. The interpretation guidelines are as follows: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Between "0" and "2" = limited support for chronic illness care </li>
    <li>Between "3" and "5" = basic support for chronic illness care </li>
    <li>Between "6" and "8" = reasonably good support for chronic illness care </li>
    <li>Between "9" and "11" = fully developed chronic illness care </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: </p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The <a href="/browse/by-organization-indiv.aspx?orgid=2509&amp;objid=48039" title="Measure Collection">ACIC</a> provides subscale scores corresponding to each of the Chronic Care Model elements, as well as an overall score. Scores for each section are obtained by summing the values for all items within a section and dividing by the number of items within that section. The overall score is derived by summing the average scores of each section and dividing by the number of sections administered. Divide the overall score (sum of the average subscale scores) by 7 (the number of subscales) to obtain the average overall score. </li>
    <li>This measure summary is based on Version 3.5 of the survey instrument.

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The prevalence of individuals with chronic illness is growing at an astonishing rate because of the rapid aging of the population and the greater longevity of individuals with chronic illness (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2000). This growth has taxed health-care systems and revealed deficiencies in the organization and delivery of care to patients with chronic illness (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1997; "Hypertension," 1998; Desai, Zhang, &amp; Hennessy, 1999). There is a growing literature, however, describing effective interventions that improve systems of care in which persons with chronic illness are treated (McCulloch et al., 2000; Lorig et al., 1999; Weinberger et al., 1989; Weinberger et al., 1991; Von Korff et al., 1997; Wagner, Austin, &amp; Von Korff, "Improving outcomes," 1996; Wagner, Austin, &amp; Von Korff, "Organizing care," 1996). This literature strongly suggests that changing processes and outcomes in chronic illness requires multicomponent interventions that change the prevailing clinical system of care (Wagner, Austin, &amp; Von Korff, "Improving outcomes," 1996; Wagner, Austin, &amp; Von Korff, "Organizing care," 1996; Wagner et al., 1999).</p>
<p>The Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) was developed to help organizational teams identify areas for improvement in their care for chronic illnesses, and to evaluate the level and nature of improvements made in their system (Bonomi et al., 2000). The ACIC is based on six areas of system change suggested by the Chronic Care Model (CCM) that have been shown to influence quality of care&mdash;linkages to community resources, self-management support, decision support, delivery system design, clinical information systems, and organization of the health system&mdash;and promising interventions within these areas associated with better outcomes (Wagner, Austin, &amp; Von Korff, "Improving outcomes," 1996; Wagner, Austin, &amp; Von Korff, "Organizing care," 1996; Wagner et al., 1999).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Data Sources</strong><br />
(1) Pre-post, self-report Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) data from organizational teams enrolled in 13-month quality-improvement collaboratives focused on care for chronic illness; (2) independent faculty ratings of team progress at the end of collaborative.</p>
<p><strong>Study Design</strong><br />
Teams completed the ACIC at the beginning and end of the collaborative using a consensus format that produced average ratings of their system's approach to delivering care for the targeted chronic condition. Average ACIC subscale scores (ranging from 0 to 11, with 11 representing optimal care) for teams across all four collaboratives were obtained to indicate how teams rated their care for chronic illness before beginning improvement work. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the ACIC to detect system improvements for teams in two (of four) collaboratives focused on care for diabetes and congestive heart failure (CHF). Pearson correlations between the ACIC subscale scores and a faculty rating of team performance were also obtained. </p>
<p><strong>Results</strong><br />
Average baseline scores across all teams enrolled at the beginning of the collaboratives ranged from 4.36 (information systems) to 6.42 (organization of care), indicating basic to good care for chronic illness. All six ACIC subscale scores were responsive to system improvements diabetes and CHF teams made over the course of the collaboratives. The most substantial improvements were seen in decision support, delivery system design, and information systems. CHF teams had particularly high scores in self-management support at the completion of the collaborative. Pearson correlations between the ACIC subscales and the faculty rating ranged from .28 to .52.</p>
