<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In children with sickle cell disease (SCD), illness and death can be reduced through early diagnosis, treatment of complications, systematic follow-up and patient/parent education. In particular, timely confirmatory testing and prompt communication with families are steps that pave the way for initiating simple but life-saving treatments in young children with SCD. Neonatal screening for SCD is mandatory in the United States, but data are scarce that describe the proportion of children who receive confirmatory testing and the proportion of families who learn this information. This measure would highlight gaps where providers or health systems are falling short and encourage early and consistent treatment for all young children with SCD.</p>
<p>Children with SCD benefit significantly from early diagnosis of disease. In a group of patients diagnosed with SCD as newborns, the mortality rate was 1.8% compared with an 8% mortality rate among those diagnosed after 3 months of age (Vichinsky et al., 1988). Most of the study was conducted prior to the use of prophylactic antibiotics, which today is a standard for pediatric SCD treatment and significantly reduces the frequency of life-threatening infections. The lower mortality rate in the study is attributed to early diagnosis and treatment of complications, practices that are supported, in large part, by extensive follow-up and patient and parent education. Newborn screening for SCD followed by confirmatory testing for positive screening results, parental education and comprehensive care reduces morbidity and mortality in infants and children with SCD (National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 2002).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Prevalence and Incidence</em><br />
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States (Kavanagh et al., 2011). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (2002) estimates that 2,000 infants are born with SCD in the United States (U.S.) each year. SCD affects 70,000 to 100,000 children and adults in the United States, predominantly those of African and Hispanic descent (Hassell, 2010). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Pathology and Severity</em><br />
Vaso-occlusion (the sudden blockage of a blood vessel caused by the sickle shape of abnormal blood cells) is responsible for most complications of SCD, including pain episodes, sepsis, stroke, acute chest syndrome, priapism, leg ulcers, osteonecrosis and renal insufficiency (Steinberg, 1999). In addition, SCD can have hemolytic and infectious complications that result in morbidity and mortality in children with SCD (Kavanagh et al., 2011). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Burden in Daily Life</em><br />
The effect of SCD on children and families is significant: severe pain episodes and hospitalizations restrict daily activities and reflect negatively on school attendance and performance, sleep, and social activities (Lemanek, Ranalli, &amp; Lukens, 2009; Alvim et al., 2005). Although medical management of SCD continues to improve over time, 196 U.S. children died from SCD-related causes between 1999 and 2002 (Yanni et al., 2009). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Cost</em><br />
In a study of health care utilization among low income children with SCD between 2004 and 2007, 27% of these children required inpatient hospitalization and 39% used emergency care during a year. Of these children, 63% averaged one well-child visit per year and 10% had at least one outpatient visit with a specialist (Raphael et al., 2009). Patients with SCD use many parts of the health care system, incurring significant costs. In 2009, mean hospital charges for children with SCD and a hospital stay were $23,000 for children with private insurance and $18,200 for children enrolled in Medicaid (HCUPnet, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, 2012). Kauf et al. (2009) estimate the lifetime cost of health care per patient with SCD to be approximately $460,000. </p>
<p><em>Performance Gap</em><br />
There is significant variability and little tracking by more than half of states regarding this important issue. Neonatal screening for SCD is mandated in all 50 states, as well as in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. To our knowledge, there are no current published data that describe the proportion of children with a positive screen for SCD who receive confirmatory testing, or what proportion of families with a child who receives a positive confirmatory test result have results communicated to them. However, in a study of 52 State Newborn Screening Program follow-up coordinators with 100% participation, 100% of primary care providers were notified of positive screening SCD results, while only 81% of hematologists, 73% of hospitals, and 40% of families were notified of positive findings (Kavanagh et al., 2008). In programs where communication with the families was inconsistent, the responsibility for providing this information often fell upon someone other than the state newborn screening program. The efficacy of these efforts in ensuring timely confirmatory testing is unknown.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability</strong><br />
<em>Data/Sample</em>. This measure is based on the gold standard data source for sickle cell disease (SCD): initial and confirmatory diagnosis information that is maintained by all state newborn screening programs in the United States. The Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC) tested this measure using newborn screening results from three state public health agencies: Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Newborn screening data captures the vast majority of births in states; in Michigan, 97% of all children have newborn screening performed, while in Illinois the figure is nearly 99%. The remaining births opt out of newborn screening based on religious grounds.</p>
<p>The measure was tested as specified, which requires an assessment among the entire population of a state's birth cohort that had an initial newborn screen indicating SCD. This measure includes no sampling; consequently, no sampling error is introduced that would necessitate the calculation of measure reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><br />
The validity of this measure was determined through face validity established by a national panel of experts and advocates for families of children with SCD. Face validity is the degree to which the measure construct characterizes the concept being assessed, which was established by two Q-METRIC SCD expert panels. The panel established a very high degree of face validity for this measure through a detailed review of concepts and metrics considered to be essential to effective SCD management and treatment. The Q-METRIC expert panel included nationally recognized experts in SCD, representing hematology, pediatrics, and SCD family advocacy. In addition, measure validity was considered by experts in state Medicaid program operations, health plan quality measurement, health informatics, and health care quality measurement. In total, the Q-METRIC expert panels included 14 experts providing a comprehensive perspective on SCD management and the measurement of quality metrics for states and health plans. </p>
<p>From this group, concepts and draft measures were rated for their relative importance. This measure was among the most highly rated, with the expert panel's average score of 8.7 (out of a maximum of 9). Two rating methods were used to minimize any potential bias due to outlier ratings; this measure received identically high ratings (8.7) using both methods. In addition, the expert panelists noted that this measure not only was important, but could be accessed through state health departments. The measure as specified from state newborn screening program data was deemed to be the most valid, in contrast to candidate metrics that would be derived from provider data. Finally, the Q-METRIC SCD expert panel noted that this measure was a valid marker of important variations that they felt may exist across states; the panel noted that newborn screening programs can be highly variable across states and this measure would likely reflect those variations.</p></div>
