<p><strong>Do antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) taken during the first trimester of pregnancy increase the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) in the offspring of <strong>women with epilepsy&nbsp;</strong>(WWE) compared to the offspring of&nbsp; WWE not on AEDs?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>AEDs taken during the first trimester probably increase the risk of MCMs in the offspring of WWE (two adequately sensitive Class II studies) but it cannot be determined if the increased risk is imparted from all AEDs or from only one or some AEDs. </li>
    <li>Valproate (VPA) monotherapy during the first trimester possibly increases the risk of MCMs in the offspring of WWE (one Class II study). </li>
    <li>VPA used in polytherapy probably increases the risk of MCMs in the offspring of WWE (one Class I study). </li>
    <li>Carbamazepine (CBZ) probably does not substantially increase the risk of MCMs in the offspring of WWE (one Class I study). </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to determine if lamotrigine (LTG) (one inadequately sensitive Class I study) or other specific AEDs (no Class III or better evidence) increase the risk of MCMs in the offspring of WWE. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although there is evidence that AEDs taken during the first trimester probably increase the risk of MCMs in the offspring of WWE, it cannot be determined if the increased risk is imparted from all AEDs or from only one or some AEDs. Therefore, no recommendation is made from this conclusion. </li>
    <li>If possible, avoidance of the use of VPA as part of polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy should be considered to decrease the risk of MCMs (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>If possible, avoidance of the use of VPA monotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy may be considered to decrease the risk of MCMs (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is exposure to a specific AED during the first trimester of pregnancy associated with an increased risk of MCMs compared to exposure to other AEDs?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It is highly probable that taking VPA monotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy contributes to the development of MCMs in the offspring of WWE compared to taking carbamazepine (CBZ) (two Class I studies). </li>
    <li>VPA as part of polytherapy in the first trimester of pregnancy probably contributes to the development of MCMs in the offspring of WWE compared to polytherapy that does not include VPA (one Class I study). </li>
    <li>Taking VPA during the first trimester of pregnancy possibly contributes to the development of MCMs in the offspring of WWE compared to taking phenytoin (PHT) (one Class II study). </li>
    <li>Taking VPA during the first trimester of pregnancy possibly contributes to the development of MCMs in the offspring of WWE compared to taking LTG (two Class III studies). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>To reduce the risk of MCMs, the use of VPA during the first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided, if possible, compared to the use of CBZ (<strong>Level A</strong>). </li>
    <li>To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of polytherapy with VPA during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, should be considered, compared to polytherapy without VPA (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of VPA during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, may be considered, compared to the use of PHT or LTG (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is the risk of MCMs greater for AED polytherapy compared to AED monotherapy when taken during the first trimester of pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Polytherapy probably contributes to the development of MCMs in the offspring of WWE as compared to monotherapy (one Class I study). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of AED polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, compared to monotherapy should be considered (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is there a relationship between AED dose and the risk of MCMs in the offspring of WWE?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is probably a relationship between the dose of VPA and LTG and the risk of development of MCMs in the offspring of WWE (one Class I study). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Limiting the dosage of VPA or LTG during the first trimester, if possible, should be considered to lessen the risk of MCMs (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are there specific MCMs associated with specific AEDs? </strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>PHT exposure in utero possibly contributes to the risk of cleft palate (one Class II study). </li>
    <li>CBZ exposure in utero possibly contributes to the risk of posterior cleft palate (one Class II study). </li>
    <li>VPA exposure in utero probably contributes to neural tube defects and facial clefts (one Class I study) and possibly contributes to hypospadias (one Class II study). </li>
    <li>Phenobarbital (PB) exposure in utero possibly contributes to cardiac malformations (two Class III studies). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Avoidance of the use of VPA, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and facial clefts (<strong>Level B</strong>) and may be considered to reduce the risk of hypospadias (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Avoidance of phenobarbital (PHT), CBZ, and PB, if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of specific MCMs: cleft palate for PHT use, posterior cleft palate for CBZ use, and cardiac malformations for PB use (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is cognitive outcome reduced in children of WWE who are not exposed to AEDs in utero?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cognition is probably not reduced in children of WWE who are not exposed to AEDs in utero (two Class II studies). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Counseling of WWE who are contemplating pregnancy should reflect that there is probably no increased risk of reduced cognition in the offspring of WWE not taking AEDs (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is cognition reduced in children of WWE exposed to AEDs in utero?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to determine if the children of WWE on AEDs in general are at increased risk for reduced cognition (conflicting Class II studies). </li>
    <li>CBZ probably does not increase poor cognitive outcomes compared to unexposed controls (two Class II studies). </li>
    <li>VPA is probably associated with poor cognitive outcomes compared to unexposed controls (two Class II studies). </li>
    <li>PHT is possibly associated with poor cognitive outcomes compared to unexposed controls (one Class II and two Class III studies). </li>
    <li>PB is possibly associated with poor cognitive outcomes in male offspring of WWE compared to unexposed controls (two Class III studies). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>CBZ exposure probably does not produce cognitive impairment in offspring of WWE <strong>(Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Avoiding VPA in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Avoiding PHT in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Avoiding PB in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does AED polytherapy exposure during pregnancy pose an increased risk for poor cognitive outcome compared to monotherapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cognitive outcomes are probably reduced in children exposed to AED polytherapy as compared to monotherapy in utero (three Class II studies). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Monotherapy should be considered in place of polytherapy, if possible, for WWE who take AEDs during pregnancy to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is exposure to a specific AED in utero associated with poor cognitive outcomes compared to other AEDs</strong>?</p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cognitive outcomes are probably reduced in children exposed to VPA during pregnancy compared to CBZ (two Class II studies). </li>
    <li>Cognitive outcomes are possibly reduced in children exposed to VPA during pregnancy compared to PHT (one Class II study). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of VPA, if possible, should be considered compared to CBZ to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>

<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Neonates of WWE taking AEDs probably have an increased risk of SGA of about twice the expected rate (two Class II studies). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Pregnancy risk stratification should reflect that the offspring of WWE taking AEDs during pregnancy probably have an increased risk of SGA.

</ul>
<p><strong>Is there an increased risk of perinatal death in neonates born to WWE?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The strength of practice recommendations is linked directly to the level of evidence:</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if: 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations for Causality</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Risk factor is a highly probable contributor to the development of disease or outcome. Recommendation: Risk factor should be avoided or reduced, if possible. (Level A rating requires two or more consistent Class I studies all showing an effect size (R.R.) &ge;2 with lower confidence limits &gt;1. In addition, either (1) a causal inference is coherent with known biologic mechanisms and related scientific evidence or (2) findings clearly demonstrate that higher doses of exposure increase likelihood of disease or outcome.) </p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Risk factor is a probable contributor to the development of disease or outcome. Recommendation: Risk factor avoidance or reduction (if possible) should be considered. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study fulfilling other criteria above, OR two or more consistent Class II studies, showing an effect size (R.R. or O.R.) &ge;1.5 with lower confidence limits &gt;1.) </p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Risk factor is a possible contributor to the development of disease or outcome. Recommendation: Risk factor avoidance or reduction (if possible) may be considered. (Level C rating requires 1 Class II or 2 or more Class III studies, showing effect estimate(s) with consistent significant departure(s) from null value.) </p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = A causal relationship between the risk factor and disease or outcome is unproven or unsupported. Recommendation: None. (Evidence not meeting criteria for Class I &ndash; Class III.) </p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Rating of a Prognostic Article:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = A case control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who did not determine the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of a prognostic accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Causality</strong></p>
<p>The causality scheme is used to rate the risk of bias in studies when the clinical question requires a causal inference and a randomized controlled trial cannot be done for practical or ethical reasons. The classification emphasizes the need to establish an independent association between the risk factor and outcome after controlling for known confounding variables. Unlike a randomized controlled trial, studies rated by this scheme cannot control for unknown confounding variables.</p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective cohort study design that satisfies these criteria: (a) groups studied are representative of population of interest ('broad spectrum'); (b) risk factors and outcomes are clearly defined with validated or generally accepted criteria, and measured independently or objectively; (c) comparison groups are matched for known possible confounding risk factors, or the effects of such confounders are controlled in the study analysis; and (d) measures of association are expressed (or can be calculated) as rate ratios, risk ratios, relative risks (R.R.) or population attributable risks with confidence intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Retrospective cohort or case-control study designs that satisfy criteria (a), (b), and (c) above, in which (d) the measure of association may also be expressed (or can be calculated) as an odds ratio (O.R.) with confidence intervals. </p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Other cohort or case-control study designs in which groups studied represent a narrow spectrum of the population of interest, or the measure of association does not include an R.R. or O.R. but does include an aggregate measure such as a correlation or group mean with standard deviation or p-value. Criterion (b) above must still be satisfied. Obvious confounding is not evident.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting criteria for Class I, II, or III. Specifically, studies that are non-comparative, unrepresentative of the population of interest, with major biases or confounding, lacking useful measures of effect, or lacking measures of effect estimate stability.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Notes:</strong> In addition to the criteria above, any causal inference requires that exposure to the risk factor precede the development of the outcome. In addition, there may be need to allow for an induction period. In translating evidence, a requirement of two or more studies implies that such studies should not include the same subjects. Exploratory studies involving multiple comparisons of a variety of exposures and outcomes may be rated lower if it is evident that the study was designed without an a priori hypothesis or focus upon the specific exposure and outcome of interest. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are equivalent to prospective cohort studies in which the risk of confounding has been minimized. Evidence from such studies may be considered Class I, provided it satisfies criteria (a), (b), and (d) above. Note, however, that it is preferable to apply the American Association of Neurology (AAN) criteria for therapeutic studies when classifying evidence pertaining to the experimental (treatment) variables of an RCT.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2009 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, MEDLINE-In-Process, Current Contents, Biologic Abstracts, and BIOSIS previews for relevant articles published between 1985 and December 2005. An updated search was performed from December 2005 through June 2007, with manual searches on some topics through February 2008. The arbitrary cutoff date of 1985 was chosen because these relatively recent articles were thought to reflect current practice and AED usage patterns and therefore be more applicable and reliable for this assessment than earlier reports. The search terms used were seizures/epilepsy, catamenial epilepsy, pregnancy, anticonvulsants, antiepileptic drugs, teratogenesis, birth defects, pregnancy registry, cognitive outcome, vitamin K, folate/folic acid, breastfeeding, oral contraceptives, polycystic ovary syndrome, hormone replacement therapy, menopause, perimenopause, and fertility. The search was confined to articles using human subjects and included all languages for which there was an abstract in English. A secondary search for missed references was done by reviewing the bibliographies of review articles and meta-analyses identified in the primary search.</p>
<p>The literature search yielded a total of 876 abstracts. To find relevant articles, two panel members screened each of the abstracts. If either panel member thought the article was potentially relevant, the full text was obtained for review. In general, abstracts were excluded from further analysis if they related to eclampsia rather than seizures due to epilepsy, related to basic mechanisms such as teratogenesis or placental AED metabolism, or were unrelated to the questions posed by the panel.</p>
<p>From the abstracts, a total of 285 were selected for complete review. Four panel members reviewed the full text of the articles and identified those that were relevant to each clinical question. Seventy-eight relevant articles were identified by the literature search.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline developer searched Medline and Embase for studies published between 2009 and 2013 using the following search terms: women with epilepsy, pregnancy, seizure, teratogenesis, congenital malformations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline developer searched Medline for studies published between January 2013 to April 2016 using the following search strategy: (((((((((major congenital malformations) OR MCM) OR Cognition Disorders) OR Abnormalities, Drug-Induced) OR teratogenesis))))) AND Anticonvulsants) AND ((pregnancy) AND (((seizures) OR epilepsy) OR catamenial epilepsy)). Inclusion criteria were RCTs, humans only, relevant to clinical questions; exclusion criteria used to screen search results were the same as described in the 2009 published guideline.</p></div>

<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = A case control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who did not determine the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of a prognostic accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification of Evidence for Causality</span></strong></p>
<p>The causality scheme is used to rate the risk of bias in studies when the clinical question requires a causal inference and a randomized controlled trial cannot be done for practical or ethical reasons. The classification emphasizes the need to establish an independent association between the risk factor and outcome after controlling for known confounding variables. Unlike a randomized controlled trial, studies rated by this scheme cannot control for unknown confounding variables.</p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective cohort study design that satisfies these criteria: (a) groups studied are representative of population of interest ('broad spectrum'); (b) risk factors and outcomes are clearly defined with validated or generally accepted criteria, and measured independently or objectively; (c) comparison groups are matched for known possible confounding risk factors, or the effects of such confounders are controlled in the study analysis;&nbsp;and (d) measures of association are expressed (or can be calculated) as rate ratios, risk ratios, relative risks (R.R.) or population attributable risks with confidence intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Retrospective cohort or case-control study designs that satisfy criteria (a), (b), and (c) above, in which (d) the measure of association may also be expressed (or can be calculated) as an odds ratio (O.R.) with confidence intervals. </p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Other cohort or case-control study designs in which groups studied represent a narrow spectrum of the population of interest, or the measure of association does not include an R.R. or O.R. but does include an aggregate measure such as a correlation or group mean with standard deviation or p-value. Criterion (b) above must still be satisfied. Obvious confounding is not evident.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting criteria for Class I, II, or III. Specifically, studies that are non-comparative, unrepresentative of the population of interest, with major biases or confounding, lacking useful measures of effect, or lacking measures of effect estimate stability.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Notes:</strong> In addition to the criteria above, any causal inference requires that exposure to the risk factor precede the development of the outcome. In addition, there may be need to allow for an induction period. In translating evidence, a requirement of two or more studies implies that such studies should not include the same subjects. Exploratory studies involving multiple comparisons of a variety of exposures and outcomes may be rated lower if it is evident that the study was designed without an a priori hypothesis or focus upon the specific exposure and outcome of interest. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are equivalent to prospective cohort studies in which the risk of confounding has been minimized. Evidence from such studies may be considered Class I, provided it satisfies criteria (a), (b), and (d) above.&nbsp; Note, however, that it is preferable to apply the American Association of Neurology (AAN) criteria for therapeutic studies when classifying evidence pertaining to the experimental (treatment) variables of an RCT.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>A 20-member committee evaluated the available evidence based on a structured literature review and classification of relevant articles published between January 1985 and June 2007.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Classification and Measures of Effect</span></strong></p>
<p>Articles were classified according to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) classification of evidence schemes for prognostic articles and articles of causality (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were classified separately by four panel members. Disagreements on categorization of the articles were resolved by discussion and consensus.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Analysis of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>To attain a Class I or II rating, the study must have accounted for confounding by maternal age and socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>The question regarding risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) due to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) taken during the first trimester was addressed by including only studies where WWE not taking AEDs served as comparators.</p>
<p>For the subsequent questions, the evaluation focused on the risks of AEDs compared to each other, or findings specific to an individual AED such as a dose-malformation relationship. Therefore, three studies used in answering these questions include the offspring of mothers who took AEDs for various indications.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2009 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) assembled a panel of experts including epileptologists, general neurologists, and doctors in pharmacy with expertise in antiepileptic drugs. Panel members with expertise in obstetrics, obstetrical nursing, and teratology were also included.</p>
<p>The Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society developed a set of clinical questions relevant to the evaluation of management issues related to the care of women with epilepsy (WWE) during pregnancy.</p>
<p>The strength of the practice recommendations was directly linked to the class of evidence using the scheme described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The AAN assesses their clinical practice guidelines every 2 years to determine whether new literature has been published that would warrant an update. The following steps are taken:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Biennial correspondence is sent to all authors and the facilitator. </li>
    <li>An updated literature search and a review of methodological soundness are performed by a Guideline Development Subcommittee (GDS) member. (Note: The search should specifically seek to identify new evidence that would change the conclusions in the systematic review or recommendations in the CPG.) </li>
</ul>
<p>All documents biennially reviewed by the GDS that don't require an update are reaffirmed. See the AAN <a href="http://tools.aan.com/globals/axon/assets/9023.pdf" title="AAN Web site">Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual</a> for additional information.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) Subcommittee member who had expertise in epilepsy conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists. </p></div>

<h3>
Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The strength of practice recommendations is linked directly to the level of evidence:</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if: 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations for Causality</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Risk factor is a highly probable contributor to the development of disease or outcome. Recommendation: Risk factor should be avoided or reduced, if possible. (Level A rating requires two or more consistent Class I studies all showing an effect size (R.R.) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&gt;</span>2 with lower confidence limits &gt;1. In addition, either (1) a causal inference is coherent with known biologic mechanisms and related scientific evidence or (2) findings clearly demonstrate that higher doses of exposure increase likelihood of disease or outcome.) </p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Risk factor is a probable contributor to the development of disease or outcome. Recommendation: Risk factor avoidance or reduction (if possible) should be considered. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study fulfilling other criteria above, OR two or more consistent Class II studies, showing an effect size (R.R. or O.R.) &ge;1.5 with lower confidence limits &gt;1.) </p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Risk factor is a possible contributor to the development of disease or outcome. Recommendation: Risk factor avoidance or reduction (if possible) may be considered. (Level C rating requires 1 Class II or 2 or more Class III studies, showing effect estimate(s) with consistent significant departure(s) from null value.) </p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = A causal relationship between the risk factor and disease or outcome is unproven or unsupported. Recommendation: None. (Evidence not meeting criteria for Class I &ndash; Class III.) </p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><ul type="disc">
    <li>If the change from valproate to another antiepileptic drug (AED) is planned, it seems prudent to do this well before pregnancy to make sure the new treatment adequately prevents seizures. Changing to another antiepileptic drug during pregnancy poses risk of allergy, other serious adverse reactions, and polytherapy exposure. Once a patient is pregnant, changing from valproate several weeks into gestation will not avoid the risk of major congenital malformations, since this phenomenon occurs very early in pregnancy. This may also apply to cognitive teratogenesis, since the timing of exposure related to this adverse outcome is unknown. </li>
    <li>Although the risks of seizures during pregnancy have not been systematically studied, discontinuing AEDs may expose the mother and fetus to physical injury from accidents arising from partial or generalized seizures. </li>
