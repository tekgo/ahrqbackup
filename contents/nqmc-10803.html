Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease seen within a 12 month period who also have prior myocardial infarction (MI) or a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), beta-blockers are recommended for 3 years after myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. Beta-blockers, particularly carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol, which have been shown to reduce risk of death, are recommended indefinitely for patients with CAD and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). These agents have proven efficacy in reducing angina onset and improving the ischemic threshold during exercise. In patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction (MI), beta-blockers significantly reduce deaths and recurrent MIs (Fihn et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Nonadherence to cardioprotective medications is prevalent among outpatients with CAD and can be associated with a broad range of adverse outcomes, including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and the need for revascularization procedures. </p>
<p>This measure is intended to promote beta-blocker usage in select patients with CAD.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>Beta-blocker therapy should be started and continued for 3 years in all patients with normal left ventricular (LV) function after MI or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (Fihn et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Beta-blocker therapy should be used in all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] less than or equal to 40%) with heart failure or prior MI, unless contraindicated. (Use should be limited to carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol, which have been shown to reduce risk of death) (Fihn et al., 2012).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong> </p>
<p><em>Prevalence and Incidence</em> </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>16.3 million Americans are living with coronary heart disease (Roger et al., 2011). Total coronary heart disease prevalence is 7.0% in adults aged 20 years and older in the United States (U.S.). Prevalence of coronary heart disease for men is 8.3% and for women is 6.1%. </li>
    <li>Coronary heart disease makes up more than half of all cardiovascular events in men and women less than 75 years of age. </li>
    <li>The lifetime risk of developing coronary heart disease after age 40 is 49% for men and 32% for women. </li>
    <li>The incidence of coronary heart disease in women lags behind men by 10 years for total coronary heart disease and by 20 years for more serious clinical events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden death. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mortality</em> </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>While death rates have fallen from 1968 to the present, coronary heart disease is the largest killer of men and women in the U.S. It has been estimated that approximately 47% of this decrease is attributed to treatments (medical and surgical), while approximately 44% is attributed to changes in risk factors. </li>
    <li>Coronary heart disease caused approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the U.S. in 2007. </li>
    <li>Approximately 81% of people who die of coronary heart disease are greater than or equal to 65 years of age. </li>
    <li>The mortality rate for women age 35 to 44 increased on average by 1.3% per year between 1997 and 2002. </li>
    <li>Since 1984, the number of deaths for women has exceeded those for men; in 2005, women represented 52.6% of deaths from coronary heart disease. </li>
    <li>People who have had a MI have a sudden death rate 4 to 6 times that of the general population. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Office Visits</em> </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>2008 data found that the number of ambulatory care visits for coronary heart disease was 16,251,000. The majority of these visits (62.2%) were for coronary atherosclerosis. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost </em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In 2007, the estimated direct and indirect cost for coronary heart disease in the U.S. is $177.5 billion. </li>
    <li>In 2006, coronary artery disease was the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals at a cost of $52.6 billion (Andrews, 2008) and accounted for 5% of total hospitalization costs (Levit et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>Thirty percent of Medicare's total expenditures are applied to cardiovascular disease (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2008). </li>
    <li>In 2007, $5.2 billion was spent on outpatient visits related to chronic ischemic heart disease (Trogdon et al., 2007). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>According to a study analyzing the quality of care in the U.S., on average, patients with coronary artery disease received the recommended quality of care 68% of the time (McGlynn et al., 2003). Quality of care was assessed by analysis of clinician performance on thirty-seven coronary artery disease quality indicators. Quality of care varied significantly by indicator with average rates of adherence ranging from 29.13% for counseling for smoking cessation at the time of coronary artery disease diagnosis to 100% for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment of patients hospitalized with MI either during hospitalization or within two weeks of hospital discharge.</p>
<p>A study conducted by Ho et al. (2008) found that nonadherence to cardioprotective medications was prevalent among outpatients with coronary artery disease and was associated with a broad range of adverse outcomes, including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and the need for revascularization procedures. Although there have been improvements in the prescription rates of secondary prevention medications for coronary artery disease patients, a gap persists between the benefits demonstrated with these medications in clinical trials and the effectiveness observed in clinical practice. One potential explanation for this discrepancy is suboptimal adherence to secondary prevention medications in practice compared with clinical trials, where adherence is often closely monitored. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Over a median follow up of 4.1 years, medication nonadherence to statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and beta-blockers was common, occurring in approximately 1 in 4 patients. </li>
    <li>Among patients dispensed beta-blockers (n = 11,865), 28.8% were nonadherent. </li>
    <li>For patients dispensed ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) (n = 10,021), 21.6% were nonadherent. </li>
    <li>For patients taking statin medications (n = 13,596), 26.0% were nonadherent. </li>
</ul>
<p>In another study conducted by Apikoglu Rabus and colleagues, 73 patients who were diagnosed to have coronary artery disease were followed up for 5 years. They concluded there was suboptimal prescribing of secondary prevention drugs and absence of continuity of prescribing these secondary prevention drugs in the pharmaceutical care of coronary artery disease patients. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The 'initial prescribing rate' at discharge was found to be 82% for aspirin, 49% for statins, 44% for ACE inhibitors and 55% for beta-blockers. </li>
    <li>'Continuity of prescribing' for 5 years was 45% for aspirin, 26% for statins, 17% for ACE inhibitors and 20% for beta-blockers (Apikoglu Rabus et al., 2008). </li>
</ul>
<p>Cardiac rehabilitation programs remain underused. In the U.S., only 10% to 20% of the 2 million eligible patients per year who experience MI or underwent cardiac revascularization procedures participated in cardiac rehabilitation programs (Spronk et al., 2008).</p>
<p><strong>Measure Importance</strong></p>
<p><em>Opportunity for Improvement</em></p>
<p>Suboptimal rates of beta-blocker prescriptions among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are evidenced by several recent studies. </p>
<p>Maddox and colleagues analyzed data from 2008 through 2010 from the National Cardiovascular Data (NCDR) PINNACLE Registry&reg;, a national outpatient cardiology practice registry, to assess practice variation of secondary prevention medication prescription among CAD patients. Among eligible patients, beta-blockers were prescribed in 73.3% (63,800/86,999) at their index clinic visit. After inclusion of all visits among eligible patients occurring within the year following the index visit, the rates increased to 77.3%. Among practices, the median prescription rate of beta-blockers for eligible patients at their index clinic visit was 78.4% (range 35.2 to 100%) and 79.4% (range 46.2 to 100%) after inclusion of all visits among eligible patients occurring within the year following the index visit (Maddox et al., 2014).</p>
<p>An earlier study by Chan and colleagues analyzed 2008 to 2009 data from the Pinnacle registry and found slightly higher rates (86.4%) of beta-blocker prescription among CAD patients following an MI (Chan et al., 2010).</p>
<p>It's important to note that the Chan et al. study examined compliance rates with performance measures among the first 14,000 outpatients enrolled in the PINNACE program as compared to the Maddox et al. study which included a larger and more heterogeneous patient and practice population.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on several measure testing projects in 2004, 2009 and 2015 to ensure the <em>Coronary Artery Disease&ndash;Beta Blocker Therapy Prior to Myocardial Infarction (MI) or Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD)</em> measure is reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure denominator, numerator and exception case identification. The testing projects were conducted utilizing electronic health record data and registry data. Parallel forms reliability and signal-to-noise reliability was tested. </p>
<p>One site participated in the parallel forms testing of the <em>Coronary Artery Disease&ndash;Beta Blocker Therapy Prior to MI or LVSD</em> measure. Site A was an academic general internal medicine clinic with several years of experience using a commercial electronic health record (EHR). The clinic employs 40 full or part-time internal medicine physicians and provides more than 41,000 patient visits annually. </p>
<p>Signal-to-noise reliability was assessed using 2013 data acquired from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Physician Quality Reporting System Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) database. </p>
<p><strong>Measures Tested</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Coronary Artery Disease&ndash;Beta Blocker Therapy Prior to MI or LVSD </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from electronic health records were used to calculate parallel forms reliability for the measures and data acquired from the GPRO database were used to perform signal-to-noise reliability for the measures. </p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Coronary Artery Disease&ndash;Beta Blocker Therapy Prior to MI or LVSD </em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parallel Forms Reliability Testing</span> (Site A) </p>
<p>There were 134 observations from Site A included as part of the analysis. Of the 134 patients sampled via automated EHR review, 111 patients (82.8%) meeting the numerator criteria were detected. Performance on the measure was calculated to be 90.3% through comparison of automated and manual EHR review. </p>
<p>Discrepancies between performance measures based on EHR automated review alone and those based on automated review plus manual reviews were due to two types of misclassification: failure to correctly identify performance of quality measures among true, eligible patients; and failure to correctly exclude patients. Upon further analysis, the differences between automated review alone and automated plus manual reviews were 10 patients (7.5%). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signal-to-Noise Reliability Testing</span></p>
<p>GPRO Registry </p>
<p>For this measure, the reliability at the minimum level of quality reporting events (10) was 0.65. The average number of quality reporting events for physicians included is 61.0. The reliability at the average number of quality reporting events was 0.92. </p>
<p>This measure has moderate reliability when evaluated at the minimum level of quality reporting events and high reliability at the average number of quality events.</p></div>
