Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Three separate literature searches were conducted: one for evidence summaries (such as meta-analyses); one for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the efficacy, infection, and lymphoma outcomes; and one for observational evidence to supplement the data on infection and lymphoma. An information specialist developed each search with input from the project team. All search results were imported using bibliographic management software for de-duplication and title and abstract screening.</p>
<p>The following bibliographic databases were searched through the Ovid interface: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, and EMBASE. Parallel searches included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Methodology Register, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database. The search strategy comprised controlled vocabulary, including the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), and keywords. The main search concepts included and combined were "Crohn disease" and "immunomodulator therapy" and "anti-tumor necrosis factor." Methodological filters were applied to limit retrieval to RCTs, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and health technology assessments. The results were limited to English, human, and 1995 onward. The second search consisted of the main search concepts "Crohn disease" and "immunomodulator therapy" and "anti-tumor necrosis factor" plus "lymphoma." The results were limited to English language and 2010 onward, because prior systematic reviews using appropriate search strategies had adequately covered earlier time frames. A search for observational evidence on harm was performed from this search (see Supplementary Methods for the detailed search strategies). Updated information on serious infection and lymphoma (The Crohn's Therapy, Resource, Evaluation, and Assessment Tool [TREAT] registry) became available during the writing process and was thus included in this review.</p>
<p>For more information on excluded and included studies and search strategies, refer to the technical review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Based on the literature searches, the guideline developers identified existing systematic reviews and used AMSTAR, a validated instrument, to evaluate the quality of systematic reviews. Systematic reviews that were of high quality, were up-to-date, and used the outcomes of interest (e.g., corticosteroid-free remission based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI]) were selected for inclusion in the evidence profiles. When systematic reviews were not up-to-date or were incomplete, the guideline developers performed their own meta-analysis (random effects model for 3 or more studies and fixed effects model for 2 studies) using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.1 software.</p>
<p>Harm data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were sometimes of inadequate quality or had very few events. When this occurred, the guideline developers identified observational studies and assessed them for risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool. The guideline developers selected the observational studies with the highest methodological quality and greatest number of events for the outcomes of serious infections and lymphoma.</p>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This clinical practice guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and was drafted by an American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Guideline Panel, reviewed by the Clinical Practice and Quality Management Committee, and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. The guideline is published in conjunction with a technical review on the same subject, and interested readers are encouraged to refer to that publication for in-depth consideration of topics covered by this guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>To develop this document, the members of the guideline panel met with the authors of the technical review in Chicago on March 16, 2013. Also attending the meeting were the current and incoming chairs of the AGA Clinical Practice and Quality Management Committee, senior members of the AGA staff, and a consumer representative. The authors of the technical review presented to the group the results of the systematic review of the evidence for each clinical question to be addressed in the guideline, organized in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). For each PICO, the group came to an agreement regarding the overall quality of the evidence, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, patient values and preferences regarding the desirable and undesirable effects, and whether or not the intervention in question represents a prudent use of resources.</p>
<p>Using the PICO format, the guideline developers outlined a total of 16 PICO questions. Based on these parameters, the members of the guideline panel then reached consensus regarding a recommendation for or against each intervention and rated the strength of the recommendation as either strong or weak. Strong recommendations were made when (1) the overall quality of the evidence was moderate or high regarding the efficacy and safety of the intervention, (2) there was little or no uncertainty regarding the balance of desirable and undesirable effects of the intervention, (3) there was little or no uncertainty regarding a patient's values and preferences regarding the intervention and its effects, and (4) there was little or no uncertainty as to whether or not the intervention was too costly given the expected benefits.</p>
<p>The implication of a strong recommendation is that most patients should receive the recommended course of action and that adherence to this recommendation could be used as a quality of care indicator. The implication of a weak recommendation is that the course of action is suggested but that additional factors, such as the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences, will need to be considered. The majority of fully informed patients would still want to follow this course of action, but many would not. The final decision regarding the course of action would be the product of shared decision making between the health care provider and patient.</p></div>

Potential Harms

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There are very rare reports that associate use of methotrexate with an increased risk of lymphoma. </li>
    <li>Although high-quality data are lacking, it does appear that long-term use of thiopurines is associated with a 1.5- to 5-fold increased risk of lymphoma and with a possibly slightly higher risk of serious infection, although the absolute rates of these adverse events are low. </li>
    <li>Opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis or fungal infections, can occur as a direct consequence of use of the anti&ndash;tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&alpha; drugs. </li>
    <li>Anti&ndash;TNF-&alpha; drug/thiopurine combination therapy is associated with an increase in the rate of lymphoma. </li>
