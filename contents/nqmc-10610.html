Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members who turned 15 months old during the measurement year and who had the following number of well-child visits with a primary care practitioner (PCP) during their first 15 months of life:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>No well-child visits </li>
    <li>One well-child visit </li>
    <li>Two well-child visits </li>
    <li>Three well-child visits </li>
    <li>Four well-child visits </li>
    <li>Five well-child visits </li>
    <li>Six or more well-child visits </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This measure is based on the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) visits.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Administrative and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Administrative Specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid Specification.

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure looks at the adequacy of well-child care for infants. It measures the percentage of children who had between one and six or more well-child visits by the time they turned 15 months of age.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (2000) recommends six well-child visits in the first year of life: the first within the first month of life, and then at around 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. These visits are of particular importance during the first year of life, when an infant undergoes substantial changes in abilities, physical growth, motor skills, hand-eye coordination and social and emotional growth. Regular check-ups are one of the best ways to detect physical, developmental, behavioral and emotional problems. They also provide an opportunity for the clinician to offer guidance and counseling to the parents.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

<div class='field field_picklist-choice'>
<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A clinical practice guideline or other peer-reviewed synthesis of the clinical research evidence
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Assessing physical, emotional and social development is important at every stage of life, particularly with children and adolescents (Child Trends, 2012). Behaviors established during childhood or adolescence, such as eating habits and physical activity, often extend into adulthood (Kann et al., 2014). A health care provider's advice or guidance pertaining to health behaviors can have a significant impact. </li>
    <li>Studies show that children with delayed development who receive early intervention are more likely to graduate high school, hold a job, live independently and avoid teen pregnancy, delinquency and violent crimes&mdash;representing a saved cost to society of between $30,000 and $100,000 per child (Glascoe &amp; Shapiro, 2007).</li>
    <li>The 2011/2012 National Survey of Children's Health showed that an estimated 11 million children 0 to 17 years of age did not have any preventive medical care visits in the past year (Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative [CAHMI], n.d.). </li>
    <li>Well-care visits provide an opportunity for providers to influence health and development. A well-care visit is a critical opportunity for screening and counseling. Assessing changes in physical and social circumstances can help lessen the risk of serious and long-term health effects. </li>
</ul>
