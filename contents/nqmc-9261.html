Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children under age 5 using antipsychotic medications during the measurement period.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This measure was developed for a Medicaid population and tested with Medicaid data.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Antipsychotic use is occasionally needed for young children but has no indications for children under age 5. First time second-generation antipsychotic medication use has been associated with rapid and significant increases in body composition, with varying effects on metabolic profiles in adolescent and pediatric patients. </p>
<p>This measure uses a cut-off of 5 years of age based on one risperidone indication for irritability from autism in age 5 years old and older. None of the antipsychotics have any U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for under age 5. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure was pilot tested during measure development (see process below), which included reliability and validity testing.</p>
<p><strong>Process for Development and Testing of Performance Measures </strong></p>
<p>Step 1: Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) workgroups identify measure concepts that may be appropriate for development into fully specified performance measures. The workgroups focus on specific aspects of the medication-use system and/or specific therapeutic areas. The workgroups are open to all members of PQA and use a consensus-based approach to identify, prioritize and recommend the measure concepts that are deemed to be highly important for supporting quality improvement related to medications. </p>
<p>Step 2: The measure concepts that are recommended for further development through a vote by the PQA workgroups are forwarded to the PQA Quality Metrics Expert Panel (QMEP) for evaluation and refinement. The QMEP reviews the measure concepts to provide an initial assessment of the key properties of performance measures (i.e., feasibility, usability and scientific validity). The measure concepts that are rated highly on these key properties will then undergo technical specification. </p>
<p>Step 3: The draft measure is provided to PQA member organizations for their comments prior to preparing technical specifications for pilot testing. The QMEP reviews member comments, edits the draft measure accordingly and poses testing questions based on this all-member feedback. </p>
<p>Step 4: PQA selects partners to test the draft measure. These partners are often PQA member health plans or academic institutions with expertise in quality and performance measure testing. The testing partner implements the draft technical specifications with their existing datasets and provides a report to PQA that details testing results and recommendations for modifications of the technical specifications. </p>
<p>Step 5: The workgroup that developed the measure reviews the testing results and provides comment. The QMEP reviews the workgroup comments, testing results, recommendations and potential modifications and provides a final assessment of the feasibility and scientific validity of the draft performance measures.</p>
<p>Step 6: Measures that are recommended by the QMEP for endorsement are posted on the PQA web site for member review, written comments are requested, and a conference call for member organizations is scheduled to address any questions. This process allows members to discuss their views on the measures in advance of the voting period. </p>
<p>Step 7: PQA member organizations vote on the performance measure(s) considered for endorsement.</p></div>
