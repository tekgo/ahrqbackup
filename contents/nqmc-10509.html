<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Pharyngitis is the only condition among upper respiratory infections (URIs) where diagnosis is validated easily and objectively through administrative and laboratory data, and it can serve as an important indicator of appropriate antibiotic use among all respiratory tract infections. Overuse of antibiotics has been directly linked to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance; promoting judicious use of antibiotics is important to reducing levels of antibiotic resistance (Gonzales et al., 2001). Pediatric clinical practice guidelines (Schwartz et al., 1998) recommend that only children diagnosed with group A streptococcus (strep) pharyngitis, based on appropriate lab tests, be treated with antibiotics. A strep test (rapid assay or throat culture) is the definitive test of group A strep pharyngitis. Excess use of antibiotics is highly prevalent for pharyngitis: about 35 percent of the total 9 million antibiotics prescribed for pharyngitis in 1998 were estimated to be in excess (Seppala et al., 1997).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Pharyngitis, or sore throat, is a leading cause of pediatric ambulatory care visits and can be caused by a virus or by bacteria (Simon, 2014). Viral pharyngitis does not require antibiotic treatment, but antibiotics continue to be inappropriately prescribed. Inappropriate treatment with antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance (when antibiotics can no longer cure bacterial infections) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], "Antibiotics aren't," 2013), which makes it essential that children with pharyngitis have appropriate testing, diagnosis and treatment. </li>
    <li>Pharyngitis caused by bacteria accounts for only about 30 percent of all cases of pharyngitis in children (Huang et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>Despite improvements in antibiotic prescribing for children with pharyngitis, a substantial number of patients still receive inappropriate antibiotic treatment (Shulman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Treating pharyngitis in children costs the United States approximately $224 to $539 million each year (Pfoh et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>Each year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and at least 23,000 people die as a direct result (CDC, "Antibiotic resistance," 2013). </li>
    <li>Antibiotics are often used inappropriately to treat pharyngitis that is not caused by bacteria. Proper testing and treatment of pharyngitis would prevent the spread of sickness, while reducing the unnecessary use of antibiotics (CDC, "Is it strep," 2013). </li>
</ul>
