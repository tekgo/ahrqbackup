<div class="content_para"><p>This Best Evidence Statement addresses only key points of care for the target population; it is not intended to be a comprehensive practice guideline. These recommendations result from review of literature and practices current at the time of their formulation. This Best Evidence Statement does not preclude using care modalities proven efficacious in studies published subsequent to the current revision of this document. This document is not intended to impose standards of care preventing selective variances from the recommendations to meet the specific and unique requirements of individual patients. Adherence to this Statement is voluntary. The clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient must make the ultimate judgment regarding the priority of any specific procedure.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Applicability Issues</strong></p>
<p>Communication skills trainings can be time-consuming. Trainings ranged from 30 minutes to four days in length. Several of the studies also included follow-up training, ranging from four 4 hours to 1.5 days each. It will be important to allot time for nurses to attend communication skills training and follow-up sessions (if needed), outside of their regular assigned work duties. Additionally, extra funding may be needed to support staff time to conduct and participate in the training. Communication skills training sessions could be implemented during orientation for new nursing employees. In addition, the Therapeutic Collaborative training can also be used as a means to achieve communication skills training for nurses. The Therapeutic Collaborative training is currently given to nurses caring for bone marrow transplant patients in a pediatric institution. It aims to assist nurses in forming therapeutic relationships with their patients and families, addressing professional boundaries, the "zone of helpfulness," and personality style and how it relates to communication. This training has been conducted in a group format over a 4-hour period of time. It is also offered as an internet web-based video, with individual discussion between nurses and their clinical managers. This offers more flexibility for training to be completed and makes it easier from a scheduling standpoint. Communication skills training could be included as a part of the Therapeutic Collaborative training.</p></div>
