Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of Medicare members 65 years of age and older who had a doctor's visit in the past 12 months and who spoke with a doctor or other health provider about their level of exercise or physical activity.</p>
<p>This measure is collected using the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS). Results are calculated by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) using data collected in the combined baseline and follow-up survey samples from the same measurement year.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Despite the proven benefits of regular physical activity on the health of older adults, over half of the older population is sedentary (47 percent of older adults 65 to 74 years of age and 61 percent of adults over 75 do not engage in physical activity) ("Increasing," 2001; U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 1996). Less than a third of the elderly population is regularly active. In particular, older women, who share a higher burden of morbidity and mortality, are less likely to exercise than older men: 66 percent of women, compared to 54 percent of men 75 and older, do not engage in leisure-time physical activity according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey.</p>
<p>By targeting the health care system, this measure complements national efforts to increase physical activity levels in the community through a wide range of community actions and environmental and policy approaches, as well as behavioral/social interventions recommended by the United States Task Force on Community Preventive Services ("Increasing," 2001).</p>
<p>Engaging in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week is recommended for the general population by USPSTF ("Increasing," 2001). Increased physical activity is especially important for the older population, which can most benefit from increased activity levels to improve the gradual decline in functioning and health status associated with increasing age (USPSTF, 1996). Furthermore, studies have shown that even a small increase in physical activity leads to health benefits. Encouraging people to be more physically active is even more cost-effective and has greater health benefits than getting people to quit smoking.</p>
<p>Currently there is a low prevalence of physicians counseling patients to exercise; therefore, there is a high potential for organizations to improve on this measure. Examples of effective interventions for changing patient behavior include patient goal setting, written exercise prescriptions, individually tailored exercise regimens and multidimensional approaches. Organizations can help reduce health care costs through cost-effective behavior-change interventions that demonstrate favorable return on investment, especially considering the higher health care charges associated with each risk factor.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Physical activity can be defined as movement that increases your heart rate above its resting rate. Regular physical activity can help control weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, strengthen bones and muscles and improve mental health (National Institutes of Health [NIH], 2012). </li>
    <li>In 2012, only about 14.8 percent of adults 65 to 74 years and 7.9 percent of adults 75 years and older met both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity guidelines (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014). </li>
    <li>Physical activity reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, colon cancer, breast cancer and cognitive impairment, and can relieve anxiety and depression (American College of Sports Medicine et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>Being physically active can lead to fewer hospitalizations and lower medication use for a variety of illnesses (Elsawy &amp; Higgins, 2010). </li>
    <li>Any amount of physical activity reduces the risk of developing certain chronic conditions and increases quality of life. Health care providers can help older adults attain and maintain health by providing advice on appropriate types and levels of activity (NIH, 2012). </li>
