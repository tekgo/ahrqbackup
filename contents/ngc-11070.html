<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based, Formal consensus, Informal consensus, No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>How should chronic pain be managed in the adult cancer survivor?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Screening and Comprehensive Assessment</span></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: Clinicians should screen for pain at each encounter. Screening should be performed and documented using a quantitative or semiquantitative tool. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: Clinicians should conduct an initial comprehensive pain assessment. This assessment should include an in-depth interview that explores the multidimensional nature of the pain (pain descriptors, associated distress, functional impact, and related physical, psychological, social, and spiritual factors) and captures information about cancer treatment history and comorbid conditions, psychosocial and psychiatric history (including substance use), and prior treatments for the pain. The assessment should characterize the pain, clarify its cause, and make inferences about pathophysiology. A physical examination should accompany the history, and diagnostic testing should be performed when warranted. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: Clinicians should be aware of chronic pain syndromes resulting from cancer treatments, the prevalence of these pain syndromes, risk factors for individual patients, and appropriate treatment options. A list of common cancer pain syndromes can be found in Table 3 in the original guideline document. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.4</em>: Clinicians should evaluate and monitor for recurrent disease, second malignancy, or late-onset treatment effects in any patient who reports new-onset pain. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Treatment and Care Options</span></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: Clinicians should aim to enhance comfort, improve function, limit adverse events, and ensure safety in the management of pain in cancer survivors. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.2</em>: Clinicians should engage patient and family/caregivers in all aspects of pain assessment and management. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.3</em>: Clinicians should determine the need for other health professionals to provide comprehensive pain management care in patients with complex needs. If deemed necessary, the clinician should deﬁne who is responsible for each aspect of care and refer patients accordingly. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Nonpharmacologic Interventions</em></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.4</em>: Clinicians may prescribe directly or refer patients to other professionals to provide the interventions outlined in Table 4 in the original guideline document to mitigate chronic pain or improve pain-related outcomes in cancer survivors. These interventions must take into consideration pre-existing diagnoses and comorbidities and should include an assessment for adverse events. (Evidence-based; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Pharmacologic Interventions: Miscellaneous Analgesics</em></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.5</em>: Clinicians may prescribe the following systemic nonopioid analgesics and adjuvant analgesics to relieve chronic pain and/or improve function in cancer survivors in whom no contraindications, including serious drug&ndash;drug interactions exist:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) </li>
    <li>Acetaminophen (paracetamol) </li>
    <li>Adjuvant analgesics, including selected antidepressants and selected anticonvulsants with evidence of analgesic efﬁcacy (such as the antidepressant duloxetine and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin) for neuropathic pain conditions or chronic widespread pain </li>
</ul>
<p>(Evidence-based; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.6</em>: Clinicians may prescribe topical analgesics (such as commercially available NSAIDs; local anesthetics; or compounded creams/gels containing baclofen, amitriptyline, and ketamine) for the management of chronic pain. (Evidence-based; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.7</em>: Corticosteroids are not recommended for long-term use in cancer survivors solely to relieve chronic pain. (Evidence-based; Harms outweigh beneﬁts; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.8</em>: Clinicians should assess the risks of adverse effects of pharmacologic therapies, including nonopioids, adjuvant analgesics, and other agents used for pain management. (Evidence-based and informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.9</em>: Clinicians may follow speciﬁc state regulations that allow access to medical cannabis or cannabinoids for patients with chronic pain after a consideration of the potential beneﬁts and risks of the available formulations. (Evidence-based; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Pharmacologic Interventions: Opioids</em></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.10</em>: Clinicians may prescribe a trial of opioids in carefully selected cancer survivors with chronic pain who do not respond to more conservative management and who continue to experience pain-related distress or functional impairment. Tables 5 and 6 in the original guideline document provide guidelines intended to promote safe and effective prescribing. Nonopioid analgesics and/or adjuvants can be added as clinically necessary. (Evidence-based; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.11</em>: Clinicians should assess the risks of adverse effects of opioids used for pain management. Table 7 in the original guideline document lists opioid-related long-term adverse effects. (Evidence-based and informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Risk Assessment and Mitigation and Universal Precautions with Opioid Use</span></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em>: Clinicians should assess the potential risks and beneﬁts when initiating treatment that will incorporate long-term use of opioids. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em>: Clinicians should clearly understand terminology such as tolerance, dependence, abuse, and addiction as it relates to the use of opioids for pain control. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3</em>: Clinicians should incorporate a universal precautions approach to minimize abuse, addiction, and adverse consequences of opioid use such as opioid-related deaths. Clinicians should be cautious in coprescribing other centrally acting drugs, particularly benzodiazepines (see Table 7 in the original guideline document). (Evidence-based and informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.4</em>: Clinicians should understand pertinent laws and regulations regarding the prescribing of controlled substances. (Informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.5</em>: Clinicians should educate patients and family members regarding the risks and beneﬁts of long-term opioid therapy and the safe storage, use, and disposal of controlled substances. Clinicians are encouraged to address possible myths and misconceptions about medication use and should educate patients about the need to be cautious when using alcohol or sedating over-the-counter medications, or in receiving centrally acting medications from other physicians. (Informal consensus; beneﬁts outweigh harms; evidence quality: insufﬁcient; strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.6</em>: If opioids are no longer warranted, clinicians should taper the dose to avoid abstinence syndrome. The rate of tapering and the use of cotherapies to reduce adverse effects should be individualized for each patient. (Evidence-based and informal consensus; Beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by two American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewers in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by two staff reviewers and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the original guideline document and/or in Data Supplements 1 and 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>An assessment of study quality was performed for all the included evidence by one methodologist. Systematic reviews and meta- analyses were assessed for quality using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR).</p>
<p>Design elements such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, and so forth, were assessed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methodologic criteria assessed for other study designs included type of data collection, sampling method, and conflicts of interest. In general, most of the identified studies exhibited a low to intermediate potential risk of bias. AMSTAR scores ranged from 3 to 11 out of a possible 11 points. Overall, the included systematic reviews were conducted in a rigorous fashion; however, many of the primary studies included in these reviews, and other primary RCTs identified for inclusion in this analysis, suffered from industry sponsorship, short follow-up, lack of blinding, and lack of reporting of intention-to-treat analyses. Moreover, outcomes varied greatly across studies and were often assessed by different methods or measurement scales. Refer to the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for ratings of overall potential risk of bias.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, cardiology, exercise physiology, family medicine, cancer prevention, cancer survivorship, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Expert Panel was led by three Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. For this guideline product, the Co-Chairs selected additional members from the Update Committee to form a Writing Group/Steering Committee to assist in the development and review of the guideline drafts.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The expert panel met in person and via teleconference and corresponded through e-mail. On the basis of the consideration of the evidence, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, to provide critical review, and to finalize the guideline recommendations. Members of the expert panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penultimate version of the guideline.</p>
<p>The recommendations were developed by an expert panel with multidisciplinary representation, who used a systematic review (1996 to 2015) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and clinical experience. In some selected cases in which evidence was lacking, but where there was a high level of agreement among the members of the panel and where the benefits clearly outweighed the harms, informal consensus was used (as noted in the "Major Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The guideline recommendations are crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into Decision Support (GLIDES) methodology. In addition, a guideline implementability review was conducted. On the basis of the implementability review, revisions were made to the draft to clarify recommended actions for clinical practice. Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias are provided with each recommendation.</p></div>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health care settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and their caregivers and to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the <a href="https://www.asco.org/practice-guidelines/quality-guidelines/implementation-strategy" title="ASCO Web site">ASCO Web site</a> and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
