Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adolescent and adult members with a new episode of alcohol or other drug (AOD) dependence who initiated treatment and who had two or more additional services with a diagnosis of AOD within 30 days of the initiation visit.</p>
<p>See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measure <a href="/content.aspx?id=49777" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Initiation of alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment: percentage of members who initiate treatment through an inpatient AOD admission, outpatient visit, intensive outpatient encounter, or partial hospitalization within 14 days of the diagnosis</a>.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There are more deaths, illnesses and disabilities from substance abuse than from any other preventable health condition. Treatment of medical problems caused by substance abuse places a huge burden on the health care system (Schneider Institute for Health Policy &amp; Brandeis University, 2001).</p>
<p>Treatment engagement is an intermediate step between initially accessing care (the first visit) and completing a full course of treatment. Numerous studies indicate that individuals who remain in treatment for a longer duration of time have improved outcome, but the 1990 Drug Service Research Survey suggested that many clients (52 percent) with alcohol and other drug (AOD) disorders leave treatment prematurely (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 1990). This measure is an important intermediate indicator, closely related to outcome. In fact, studies have tied frequency and intensity of engagement as important in treatment outcome and in reducing drug-related illnesses (Batten et al., 1992; McLellan et al., 1997).</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Alcohol and other drug (AOD) dependence is common across many age groups and a cause of morbidity, mortality and decreased productivity. </li>
    <li>In 2012, an estimated 23.1 million Americans (8.9 percent) needed treatment for a problem related to drugs or alcohol, but only about 2.5 million people (1 percent) received treatment (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], "Nationwide," 2014). </li>
    <li>Abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs totals more than $700 billion annually in costs related to crime, lost work productivity and health care (NIDA, "Drugs, brain," 2014). </li>
    <li>Abuse of alcohol, illicit and prescription drugs contributes to the death of more than 90,000 Americans each year (NIDA, "Drugs, brain," 2014). </li>
    <li>There is strong evidence that treatment for AOD dependence can improve health, productivity and social outcomes, and can save millions of dollars on health care and related costs. </li>
