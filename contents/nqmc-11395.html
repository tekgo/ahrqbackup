Description
</h3>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Consistent monitoring of phosphorus levels helps ensure regulation of patient morbidity and mortality, including stabilization of bone density, decreased bone pain, fracture prevention and decreased rates of arteriosclerosis and related conditions (e.g., stroke, heart attack). Routine blood tests will also aid in detection of and monitoring for abnormal states phosphorus balance in this especially vulnerable population.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility level monthly and annual performance scores. 5,951 facilities that had at least 11 eligible patients and included 517,762 patients in total were included in the testing.</p>
<p>The developer assessed reliability by calculating facility-level Pearson correlation coefficients between the current performance month and the preceding month for reporting months during January 2013&ndash;December 2013.</p>
<p>In addition, the developer calculated inter-unit reliability (IUR) for each reporting month and the overall 12 months. The monthly based measure was a simple average across individuals in the facility. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based measure, however, is not a simple average and the developer instead estimates the IUR using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficients of each pair of the current and the preceding months ranged from 0.72 to 0.90, and were all statistically significant (p less than 0.0001), indicating this measure is reliable over time.</p>
<p>The monthly IURs ranged from 0.95 to 0.97, which indicates that at least 95% of the variation in the measure calculated at the monthly level can be attributed to the between facility differences and 5% to within facility variation. The annual IUR across the 12 reporting months was 0.98, which indicates that 98% of the variation in the measure calculated at the yearly level can be attributed to the between facility variation.</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The IURs provide evidence of reliability in that most of the variation can be attributed to the between facility variation. The IUR suggest this measure is reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p>The results of the Pearson correlations indicate the measure is reliable over time.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility level monthly and annual performance scores. 5,951 facilities that had at least 11 eligible patients and included 517,762 patients in total were included in the testing.</p>
<p>The developer assessed validity using Poisson regression models to identify the predictive strength of facility level performance scores for the measure, on an NQF-endorsed standardized mortality rate, using the 2013 standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (NQF 0369).</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Poisson regression modeling was used to assess the predictive strength of facility level performance scores for the measure, on mortality, using the 2013 NQF-endorsed SMR. The results suggest the measure performance scores were predictive of the standardized mortality rate, as measured by the SMR. For instance, the facility-level relative risk of mortality for a 10% increase in the performance score is 0.98 (p less than 0.0001).</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The results of the Poisson regression suggest that facilities with a higher percentage of patient-months with phosphorous measured, have a lower standardized mortality rate relative to facilities with a lower percentage of patient-months with phosphorous measured. The direction of the relationship is as expected.</p></div>
