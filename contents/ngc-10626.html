<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the strength of evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>Level A-C</strong>) are provided at the end of the Major Recommendations.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>In adult patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, are there clinical decision rules that identify a group of patients at very low risk for the diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. In an attempt to identify patients at very low risk for acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, do not use existing clinical decision rules alone. The decision to pursue further workup for acute nontraumatic aortic dissection should be at the discretion of the treating physician.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In adult patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, is a negative serum D-dimer sufficient to identify a group of patients at very low risk for the diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Level B recommendations</strong></em>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong>Level C recommendations</strong>. In adult patients with suspected nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, do not rely on D-dimer alone to exclude the diagnosis of aortic dissection.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In adult patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, is the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography angiogram (CTA) at least equivalent to transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) to exclude the diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. In adult patients with suspected nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, emergency physicians may use CTA to exclude thoracic aortic dissection because it has accuracy similar to that of TEE and MRA.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In adult patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, does an abnormal bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) establish the diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. In adult patients with suspected nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, do not rely on an abnormal bedside TTE result to definitively establish the diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. In adult patients with suspected nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, immediate surgical consultation or transfer to a higher level of care should be considered if a TTE is suggestive of aortic dissection. (Consensus recommendation)</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In adult patients with acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, does targeted heart rate and blood pressure lowering reduce morbidity or mortality?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. In adult patients with acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, decrease blood pressure and pulse if elevated. However, there are no specific targets that have demonstrated a reduction in morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p>Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A recommendations</strong>. Generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level B recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level C recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances where consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least 2 subcommittee members and assigned a Class of Evidence. In doing so, subcommittee members assigned design classes to each article, with design 1 representing the strongest study design and subsequent design classes (e.g., design 2, design 3) representing respectively weaker study designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic clinical reports, or meta-analyses (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, including but not necessarily limited to randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, sample size, and generalizability. Using predetermined formulas related to the study's design, methodological quality, and applicability to the critical question, articles received a final Class of Evidence grade (i.e., Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles identified with fatal flaws or that were not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade "X" and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the specific critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question for which it is being considered. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different Classes of Evidence as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-specific Classes of Evidence grading may be found in the Evidentiary Table included at the end of the original guideline document.</p></div>

Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A recommendations</strong>. Generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level B recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level C recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances where consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Expert review comments were received from emergency physicians, cardiologists, and vascular surgeons, including individual members of the American Heart Association and the Society for Vascular Surgery, and the American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP) Quality and Performance Committee. Comments were received from ACEP members during a 60-day open comment period, with notices of the comment period sent in e-mails, published in <em>EM Today</em>, and posted on the ACEP Web site. The responses were used to further refine and enhance this policy; however, the responses do not imply endorsement of this clinical policy.</p>
<p>This clinical policy was approved by the ACEP Board of Directors, October 30, 2014.</p>
<p>This guideline was endorsed by the Emergency Nurses Association, November 20, 2014.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Potential Benefits of Implementing the Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clinicians recognize the limitations of using clinical decision rules alone to risk stratify patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection. </li>
    <li>In emergency department (ED) patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, the recommendations can help clinicians recognize the limitations of a negative D-dimer result in the setting of suspicion for disease. </li>
    <li>Potential benefits of computed tomography angiogram (CTA) include ready availability, rapid diagnosis of nontraumatic aortic dissection, and potential identification of alternative disorders. </li>
    <li>In adult patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection, implementing the recommendation will avoid patients being directed to inappropriate intervention on the basis of a false-positive echocardiography result. </li>
    <li>Decreasing heart rate and blood pressure may reduce the risk of further dissection and improve outcomes. </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Potential Harms of Implementing the Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The use of D-dimer may lead to unnecessary advanced imaging and exposure to radiation. </li>
    <li>Potential harms of computed tomography angiogram (CTA) include adverse events due to risks of intravenous contrast administration such as anaphylaxis, contrast-induced nephropathy, local contrast extravasation, and radiation exposure. </li>
    <li>Lack of reliance on bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) results to establish the diagnosis may result in delay of diagnosis and additional testing. </li>
    <li>Reducing blood pressure and heart rate aggressively in select patients may result in adverse events, such as in patients with severe aortic insufficiency or pericardial tamponade. </li>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of the ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of <em>Annals of Emergency Medicine</em> and its editors. </li>
    <li>This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. </li>
    <li>It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain adequate empirical data to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. </li>
    <li>This clinical policy is not intended to represent a legal standard of care for emergency physicians. Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic or management options available to the emergency physician. The ACEP recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment and patient preferences. This guideline defines for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the critical questions addressed in this policy. </li>
