<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients at risk of preterm delivery at greater than or equal to 24 and less than 34 weeks gestation who receive antenatal steroids prior to delivery of a preterm newborn.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) 1994 recommendation is to give a full course of corticosteroids to all pregnant women between 24 weeks and 34 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery. Repeated corticosteroid courses should not be used routinely, because clinical trials show decreased brain size, decreased birth weight, and adrenal insufficiency in newborns exposed to repeated doses. Treatment should consist of two doses of 12 mg of betamethasone given intramuscularly 24 hours apart or four doses of 6 mg dexamethasone given intramuscularly every 12 hours. </p>
<p>A single course of corticosteroids should be given at 24 0/7 to 33 6/7 weeks gestation ("Antenatal corticosteroids," 2000). A Cochrane meta-analysis reinforces the beneficial effect of this therapy regardless of membrane status and further concludes for all preterm deliveries the single course of corticosteroids should only be routinely administered (Roberts &amp; Dalziel, 2006).</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure
</h2>
<div class='field field_picklist-choice'>
<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A clinical practice guideline or other peer-reviewed synthesis of the clinical research evidence
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A systematic review of the clinical research literature (e.g., Cochrane Review)
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>An updated systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration analyzed 21 studies including 3885 women and 4269 infants. This review concluded that the reported use of antenatal corticosteroids resulted in significant reductions in neonatal death (RR 0.69), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (RR 0.66), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (RR 0.54), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (RR 0.46), early onset infection (RR 0.56), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (RR 0.80). There were no adverse maternal effects. </li>
    <li>RDS affects up to one fifth of low birth weight babies defined as less than 2500 grams, and extremely low birth weight babies defined as less than 1500 grams. This deadly illness that preterm babies commonly suffer from is the primary cause of early neonatal death and disability. </li>
    <li>The evidence from this new systematic review supports the continued use of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women at risk of preterm birth. This evidence greatly supports the use of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids to be considered routine for preterm delivery with few exceptions. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Twenty-six contracted performance measurement systems (PMS) agreed to support the perinatal care measures. Joint Commission staff defined and developed a database structure for electronic receipt of measure data and a verification process was implemented to assure that measures were embedded into the measurement system's technical infrastructures and into their data collection tools in accord with Joint Commission specifications. Joint Commission staff also verified data collection tools and provided education regarding the performance measure set to PMS vendors, who in turn provided education and ongoing support to their contracted hospitals. </p>
<p>Once sufficient data to support this effort were received by The Joint Commission, a reliability assessment of the measures and individual data elements was conducted from October 2011 through January 2012. A data collection tool was developed to facilitate the reabstraction of selected medical records and assessment of the reliability of the data elements. Reliability test site visits were conducted by Joint Commission staff at a subset of 12 randomly-selected hospitals. Selection of the sites was based on multiple characteristics, including hospital demographics, bed size and type of facility. </p>
<p>In the course of the reliability site visits, electronic and paper medical records were blindly reabstracted by Joint Commission staff. Reabstracted data elements were then compared with the hospital's originally abstracted data on a data element to data element basis. Differences in abstraction were investigated and adjudicated in order to understand the reasons for any disparities. In addition, structured focus group discussions were held at each site to gather additional feedback on the measures. A resource evaluation was also completed by the site visit hospitals to assess the cost and time associated with data collection effort. Feedback from the focus group discussions has been incorporated into the measure. </p></div>
