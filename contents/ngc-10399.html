Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of May 2014. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/fhp/practiceguides/lipids.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the original guideline document for additional information.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Screening/Baseline Lipid Profile </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patients</span>. All men age &ge;35 and women age &gt;45 and also men age 20 to 35 and women age 20 to 45 if at increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) <em>[IC]</em>. Can also consider checking baseline lipid profile in adults &ge;20 who are free from ASCVD for assessment of traditional ASCVD risk factors (age, sex, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], systolic blood pressure [BP], use of antihypertensive therapy, diabetes, and current smoker) <em>[IIC]</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fasting/non-fasting</span>. Screening test can be obtained fasting or non-fasting to facilitate obtaining data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Assess ASCVD Risk Factors</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clinical ASCVD (includes stroke; peripheral arterial disease; coronary heart disease [CHD]). </li>
    <li>Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) &ge;190 mg/dL and age &ge;21, not caused by drugs or underlying medical condition (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>Diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2, age 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL. </li>
    <li>10-year ASCVD risk &ge;7.5% for ages 40 to 75 years (see Table 2 in the original guideline document for calculation information). </li>
    <li>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) (If CKD, see the NGC summary of the UMHS CKD guideline <a href="/content.aspx?id=47920" title="Guideline #10323">Management of chronic kidney disease</a> for managing lipids in CKD patients). </li>
    <li>For additional risk factors to consider, see Table 3 in the original guideline document. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If No ASCVD or None of the Above Risk Factors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reinforce healthy lifestyle</span>. Education as appropriate: smoking cessation, diet-exercise-weight loss, reduce excessive alcohol <em>[IA]</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-up</span>. Repeat screening/risk assessment in 4 to 6 years <em>[IID]</em>. If borderline, consider repeat in 1 to 2 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>If ASCVD or Above Risk Factors Other Than CKD</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment through lifestyle changes</span>. Education as appropriate: smoking cessation (reduces coronary event rate by ~50% within 1 to 2 years), diet-exercise-weight loss, reduce excessive alcohol <em>[IA]</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Initiate statin therapy</span>. (Non-statin medications should be considered only in statin-intolerant patients.)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Discuss with patient: risk reduction benefits, adverse effects, drug interactions, patient preferences. </li>
    <li>Check baseline alanine transaminase (ALT) (see Table 4 in the original guideline document for monitoring abnormal baseline ALT for monitoring if liver function tests are abnormal). </li>
    <li>Dosing for LDL-C reduction: high-intensity statin (&ge;50%), moderate-intensity statin (30%-50%). See Tables 5-8 in the original guideline document for "intensity" levels, effects, interactions, and contraindications. </li>
    <li>Four main treatment benefit groups and their dosing intensity:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical ASCVD</span>: age &le;75 years = high-intensity <em>[IA]</em>; age &gt;75 years = moderate intensity <em>[IID]</em> </li>
        <li><em></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LDL-C &ge;190 mg/dL, age &ge;21</span> = high-intensity <em>[IA]</em> </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diabetes (type 1 or 2) and age 40 to 75 years with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL</span> = moderate intensity <em>[IA]</em>; can consider high-intensity if 10-year ASCVD risk &ge;7.5% <em>[IID]</em> </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10-year ASCVD risk &ge;7.5% and age 40 to 75 years</span> = moderate-to-high intensity <em>[IA]</em> </li>
        <li>If other risks (see Table 3 in the original guideline document), consider statin therapy based on individual benefit and harm. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In 6 to 12 weeks:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Check lipids to evaluate adherence. Check ALT only if baseline abnormal, known liver disease, risk factors for liver disease, or on other potentially hepatotoxic medications. Check creatine kinase (CK) only if symptomatic muscle aches/weakness. If statin-intolerance, address (see Table 9 in the original guideline document). </li>
        <li>If lipids do not decrease as expected: address adherence, reinforce lifestyle modifications, and consider referral to specialist in lipid management. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Triglycerides</span>. After initiating statin therapy, if fasting triglycerides &ge;500 mg/dL, consider treating.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longer term follow-up</span>. Check lipids annually to assess adherence.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The literature search for this update began with results of the literature searches performed in 1999 for the 2000 version of this guideline and in 2007 for the 2009 update of this guideline. Since that time the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists performed a search of relevant literature through early 2011 in developing its guidelines for management of dyslipidemia and prevention of atherosclerosis (see references in the original guideline document). Those results were used for the literature through 12/31/10. For more recent literature, a search similar to those previously performed for this guideline was conducted on Medline prospectively using the overall keywords of: <em>cholesterol (including hyperlipidemia, lipoproteins, HDL cholesterol), consensus development conferences, practice guidelines, guidelines, outcomes and process assessment (health care); clinical trials, controlled clinical trials, multicenter studies, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies; adults; English language; and published from 1/1/2011 to 4/30/2013.</em> In addition to the overall terms, for primary prevention a major search term was primary prevention of coronary artery disease with specific topic searches for: screening, pharmacotherapy, diet, exercise, alternative or complementary medicines, and other treatment. In addition to the overall terms, for secondary prevention a major search term was secondary prevention (treatment only) of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or cerebral vascular disease/stroke with specific topic searches for pharmacotherapy, diet, exercise, alternative or complementary treatment, and other treatment. An additional search using the overall terms was performed for statins and drug interactions and for individual differences and class effects of statins.</p>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p></div>

Cost Analysis

<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Statins are not considered cost effective in the low risk group, but may be cost effective in the intermediate risk group. </li>
    <li>For patients with diabetes and no other atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors, statin therapy may reasonably be delayed until age 40 since statin use in this population is only marginally cost effective. </li>
    <li>Ezetimibe should only be considered for patients intolerant to statin, niacin, fibrates, and resins, all of which have better evidence supporting their use and are more cost effective. </li>
    <li>There are arguments concerning&nbsp;age recommendations for lipid screening that there is no evidence that screening or treating young adults has been shown to be of benefit, and given their low absolute risk, would not be cost effective. </li>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Statins:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The most common adverse effect from statins is muscle aches. No evidence indicates that myalgias are more common with one statin than another. Rhabdomyolysis is a life threatening complication of statin therapy, with a 10% mortality rate. The average incidence per 10,000 person-years for monotherapy is 0.44. For patients with known risk factors for rhabdomyolysis, including those with hypothyroidism, chronic renal insufficiency, and those over age 65, who require low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering greater than can be achieved with simvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin may be considered as alternatives (see the original guideline document for information about adverse effects associated with high-dose simvastatin and statin interactions with other medications). </li>
        <li>The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol notes that the main adverse consideration is the excess risk of diabetes &ndash; about 0.1 excess case per 100 individuals treated with a moderate-intensity statin for 1 year and about 0.3 excess cases per 100 individuals treated with a high-intensity statin for 1 year. Both statin-treated and placebo-treated participants experienced the same rate of muscle symptoms. The actual rate of statin-related muscle symptoms in the clinical population is unclear. </li>
        <li>Characteristics predisposing individuals to statin adverse effects include multiple and serious co-morbidities including impaired renal or hepatic function, history of previous statin intolerance or muscle disorders, unexplained alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations &gt;3X upper limit of normal (ULN), or concomitant use of drugs affecting statin metabolism, and age &gt;75 years. If any of these predisposing characteristics are present, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended in individuals whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be recommended. High-intensity statin therapy should also be used cautiously in patients of Asian ancestry or with a history of hemorrhagic stroke. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Adverse effects are common with resins, and are dose dependent. The most common side effects are bloating, nausea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Resins interfere with absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and many drugs. </li>
    <li>Adverse effects of niacin include flushing, pruritus, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, fatigue, glucose intolerance, and gout. Hepatic toxicity has been reported, particularly with sustained release products at doses &gt;2 gm/day. Niacin should be avoided in patients with underlying liver disease or uncontrolled diabetes. </li>
    <li>Adverse effects of fibrates are generally GI, including nausea, dyspepsia, and change in bowel habits. The risk of cholestasis and cholecystectomy is increased. Fibrates carry a small risk of myopathy as monotherapy, but the risk is increased markedly when gemfibrozil is combined with statins. Fibrates may cause a small reversible increase in creatinine, and dose adjustment in renal insufficiency. </li>
    <li>For patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD), exercise must be tailored to the degree of disease. Aerobic exercises (walking, cycling, swimming) should be done at levels that do not precipitate cardiac ischemia and angina. </li>
    <li>Further information concerning general cautions about drug class and drug interactions are provided in Table 6 and Table 7 in the original guideline document. </li>
