Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of individuals 18 years of age and older, identified as smokers or tobacco users, who quit using tobacco products, had at least one interactive contact specific to smoking or tobacco cessation and remained tobacco-free for 180 days (6 months) or 365 days (12 months).</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure offers a standardized definition of risk reduction for individuals who participate in health promotion programs. Specifically, this measure focuses on tobacco use or smoking quit rates. </p>
<p>Several kinds of worksite programs and community interventions can impact smoking or tobacco use quit rates. There is strong evidence that worksite-based incentives and competitions, when combined with additional interventions to support individual cessation efforts, reduce tobacco use among workers (The Guide to Community Preventive Services, 2005). There is also strong evidence that guideline interventions, particularly proactive guidelines that offer follow-up counseling calls increase tobacco cessation among clients interested in quitting (The Guide to Community Preventive Services, 2012). There is sufficient evidence that mobile phone-based interventions increase tobacco use abstinence among people interested in quitting (The Guide to Community Preventive Services, 2011).</p></div>
