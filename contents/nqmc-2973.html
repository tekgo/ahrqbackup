<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the proportion of children who were determined to be at significant risk for developmental, behavioral, or social delays (NOTE: Items derived from the Parents Evaluation of Developmental Status [PEDS&#169;] used to identify children at significant risk.) who received some level of follow-up health care.  Follow-up items include testing of child's learning development and behavior, referral to another doctor or speech/language testing, and/or whether a doctor or other health provider noted a concern that should be watched carefully.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Early identification of children at risk for developmental, behavioral and social delays is an integral component to high quality well-child care.  The early identification of developmental problems should lead to further developmental and medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment, including early developmental intervention.  When developmental surveillance or screening identifies a child as being at high risk of a developmental disorder, diagnostic developmental evaluation should be pursued.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>1999: Pilot Testing by Mail in Three Health Plans</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS) quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability).  Findings are displayed in the article, "Assessing Health System Provision of Well-child Cared: the Promoting Healthy Development Survey."</li>
<li>In-depth cognitive testing of the draft survey was conducted with 15 families representing a range of socioeconomic and demographic groups, as well as different types of health insurance coverage, age of child, age and sex or parent, and number of children in family.  Survey design and formatting was finalized with input from a group of experts and family representatives.  Reliability assessments indicated the PHDS to be written at the 8th-9th grade reading level.  Cognitive testing confirmed the readability of the PHDS for people across a range of educational levels.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2000: Implementation by Mail to Medicaid Clients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the PHDS quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability).  These findings are displayed in the CAHMI Report, "Summary Testing and Findings of the PHDS in Maine."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2000: Implementation by Mail to Washington Medicaid Clients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the PHDS quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability).  These findings are displayed in the CAHMI Report, "PHDS Results: In Washington State."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2000-2001: Implementation by Telephone Three-State Medicaid Clients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cognitive interviews were conducted with 20 parents of children 3 to 48 months old who were enrolled in Medicaid.  Five of these interviews were conducted in-person; the remaining 15 were conducted over the telephone in order to assess the response burden and cognitive ease of the PHDS when using a telephone administration.  Using behavior coding methods, for each item in the PHDS, instances where the respondent required clarification or did not appropriately answer an item were noted.  Also, items where the interviewer had difficulty asking the question without edits to the wording were noted.  Survey modifications were made based on findings in order to improve the reliability, validity and cognitive ease of the PHDS items.</li>
<li>The PHDS was administered by telephone to parents in 3 state Medicaid programs.</li>
<li>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the PHDS quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability). These findings are displayed in the report, "Partnering with Parents to Promote the Healthy Development of Young Children Enrolled in Medicaid."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2000: A Majority of the PHDS Included in the National Survey of Early Childhood Health (NSECH)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the PHDS quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability). These findings are displayed in the article, "Measuring the quality of preventive and developmental services for young children: National estimates and patterns of clinicians' performance."</li>

<ul>
<li>Focus groups and cognitive interviews with 35 health care providers in Vermont and Washington and 20 parents of young children in Vermont to inform item-reduction, administration specifications, and reporting templates.</li>
<lI>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the PHDS quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability). These findings are displayed in the CAHMI reports, "Overview of the Round 1 Implementation of the PHDS in Mousetrap" and "University Pediatrics: Round 2 -- In-Office Implementation of the PHDS Key Findings."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2002-2004: Implementation by Telephone in Four Medicaid Agencies</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the PHDS quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability). These findings are displayed in the CAHMI report, "Hearing the Voices of Parents: Results from a Survey Assessing the Quality of Preventive and Developmental Services for Young Children Enrolled in Medicaid in Four States."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>December 2003 - March 2004 Implementation of the PHDS in Kaiser Permanente, System, Office and Provider-Level Analysis Conducted</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the PHDS quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability). These findings are displayed in the draft publication, "What drives the quality of preventive and development services provided to young children? Findings from a multi-level, provider and patient-centered method to assess quality."</li>
