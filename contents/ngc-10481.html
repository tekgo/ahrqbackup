Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence-Based, Formal Consensus, Informal Consensus, No Recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>The following recommendations are evidence based, informed by generally small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and guided by clinical experience. Ratings for benefits, harms, evidence quality, and recommendation strength are provided in Table 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)</strong></p>
<p>There are no established agents recommended for the prevention of CIPN in patients with cancer undergoing treatment with neurotoxic agents. This is based on the paucity of high-quality, consistent evidence and a balance of benefits versus harms.</p>
<p>Clinicians should not offer the following agents for the prevention of CIPN to patients with cancer undergoing treatment with neurotoxic agents:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) </li>
    <li>Amifostine </li>
    <li>Amitriptyline </li>
    <li>CaMg for patients receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Diethyldithio-carbamate (DDTC) </li>
    <li>Glutathione (GSH) for patients receiving paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Nimodipine </li>
    <li>Org 2766 </li>
    <li>All-<em>trans</em>-retinoic acid </li>
    <li>Recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (RhuLIF) </li>
    <li>Vitamin E </li>
</ul>
<p>Venlafaxine is not recommended for routine use in clinical practice. Although the venlafaxine data resulted in some support for its utility, the data were not strong enough to recommend its use in clinical practice until additional supporting data become available.</p>
<p>No recommendations can be made on the use of <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine, carbamazepine, glutamate, GSH (for patients receiving cisplatin or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy), goshajinkigan (GJG), omega-3 fatty acids, or oxcarbazepine for the prevention of CIPN at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of CIPN</strong></p>
<p>For patients with cancer experiencing CIPN, clinicians may offer duloxetine.</p>
<p>No recommendations can be made on the use of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>ALC, noting that a positive phase III abstract supported its value, but this work has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and a prevention trial suggested that this agent was associated with worse outcomes. </li>
    <li>Tricyclic antidepressants; however, based on the limited options that are available for this prominent clinical problem and the demonstrated efficacy of these drugs for other neuropathic pain conditions, it is reasonable to try a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g., nortriptyline or desipramine) in patients suffering from CIPN after a discussion with the patients about the limited scientific evidence for CIPN, potential harms, benefits, cost, and patient preferences. </li>
    <li>Gabapentin, noting that the available data were limited regarding its efficacy for treating CIPN. However, the panel felt that this agent is reasonable to try for selected patients with CIPN pain given (1) that only a single negative randomized trial for this agent was completed, (2) the established efficacy of gabapentin and pregabalin for other forms of neuropathic pain, and (3) the limited CIPN treatment options. Patients should be informed about the limited scientific evidence for CIPN, potential harms, benefits, and costs. </li>
    <li>A topical gel treatment containing baclofen (10 mg), amitriptyline HCL (40 mg), and ketamine (20 mg), noting that a single trial supported that this product did decrease CIPN symptoms. Given the available data, the panel felt that this agent is reasonable to try for selected patients with CIPN pain. Patients should be informed about the limited scientific evidence for the treatment of CIPN, potential harms, benefits, and costs. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 16), and AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine; 1985 to April 2013) databases were searched for evidence reporting on outcomes of interest. Before the systematic search of the medical literature, an environmental scan was conducted for existing reviews regarding the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). With no recent guidelines identified, older reviews with contents related to the clinical questions had their included studies cross-referenced to the guideline panel's literature search. Reference lists from other published seminal papers were scanned for additional citations. The literature search strategy is available in Appendix Table A3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence if they:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Focused on chemotherapy-induced neuropathy </li>
    <li>Included cancer survivors </li>
    <li>Considered neuropathy as an important outcome of study </li>
    <li>Were randomized trials (phase II and III) </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Were phase I studies, other noncomparative studies, case reports, editorial letters, or newspaper articles </li>
    <li>Only involved individuals under 18 years of age </li>
    <li>Were animal studies </li>
    <li>Were published in a language other than English </li>
    <li>Included less than 10 participants </li>
    <li>Focused on radiation therapy related neuropathy or stem-cell transplantation&ndash;related neuropathy </li>

The Expert Panel members are listed in Appendix Table A2 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel members, who met via teleconference and corresponded through e-mail, were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based on consideration of the evidence. Members of the Expert Panel were responsible for drafting the penultimate version of the guideline, which was then circulated for external review.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>All American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Committee before publication.</p>
<p>The Clinical Practice Guideline Committee approved this guideline update on November 19, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>External Review</strong></p>
<p>A draft of the clinical practice guideline was reviewed by two Clinical Practice Guideline Committee members and 12 Survivorship Guideline Advisory Group members. In addition to providing comment and feedback, practitioners were asked to judge the evidence review and agreement with the recommendations. One additional reviewer was asked to assess the clarity of the recommendations and ease of implementation. The evidence review was rated as high quality, and there was high agreement with the substance of the recommendations.</p>
<p>The compounded topical baclofen-amitriptyline-ketamine gel was identified as having barriers to implementation. The product was created by one compounding pharmacy for a trial, and the combination is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. Lack of insurance reimbursement for compounded products was also raised. Although not a recommended treatment, the statement regarding the topical gel as an option comes with a qualifier that specifies patients should be informed about the limited scientific evidence, potential harms, benefits, and costs.</p></div>

    <li>The clinical practice guidelines and other guidance published herein are provided by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Inc. (ASCO) to assist providers in clinical decision making. The information therein should not be relied on as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicate that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating clinician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. ASCO provides this information on an "as is" basis, and makes no warranty, expressed or implied, regarding the information. ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information or for any errors or omissions. </li>
    <li>A number of nonpharmacologic interventions have been investigated for their role in preventing or treating peripheral neuropathy. However, the paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence prohibited inclusion of those studies in this systematic review. Moreover, the studies were often conducted in diabetic populations, with no specific focus on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Nevertheless, several of the interventions have been tested in populations that included patients with cancer experiencing CIPN and, as such, merit further examination. </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Implementation</strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and cancer survivors, and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in Journal of Clinical Oncology and Journal of Oncology Practice.</p>
