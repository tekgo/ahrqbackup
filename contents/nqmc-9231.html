<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children who attend school perceived as safe, based on parents' response to the following item on the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>K10Q41: How often do you feel [child] is safe at school? Would you say never, sometimes, usually, or always? </li>
</ul>
<p>Response choices for the above question are "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always," "Don't know," and "Refused."</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Safety at schools is a major policy goal and is included in Healthy People 2010 guidelines.</p>
<p>Perceived school safety may have direct and mediated effects on child health outcomes. Children who attend schools that are usually/always safe are much more likely to be in better overall health than those who attend schools which are never safe (85% vs. 63.1%). Improvements in perceived school safety has potential benefits for improving health outcomes for all children, particularly health outcomes assessed and measured in school-based health centers.</p></div>

    <li>88.4% of children with mother-only households attend schools perceived as usually or always safe while at least 90.5% of children with any other family structure type attend schools perceived as usually or always safe. </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted testing of the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) to make sure the entire survey instrument was functioning properly. A total of 95,677 surveys were completed nationally for children between the ages of 0 and 17 years. The questionnaire was then revised and finalized based on feedback from participants in these interviews.</p>
<p>The Maternal and Child Health Bureau leads the development of the NSCH and National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) survey and indicators, in collaboration with the NCHS and a national technical expert panel. The expert panel includes representatives from other federal agencies, state Title V leaders, family organizations, and child health researchers, and experts in all fields related to the surveys (adolescent health, family and neighborhoods, early childhood and development, etc.). Previously validated questions and scales are used when available. Extensive literature reviewing and expert reviewing of items is conducted for all aspects of the survey. Respondents' cognitive understanding of the survey questions is assessed during the pretest phase and revisions made as required. All final data components are verified by NCHS and Data Resource Center/Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (DRC/CAHMI) staff prior to public release. Face validity is conducted in comparing results with prior years of the survey and/or results from other implementations of items. No specific reliability results are available for this measure. </p></div>
