Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American College of Physicians (ACP) process for assigning strength of recommendation (<strong>Strong, Weak</strong>) and grading of quality of evidence (<strong>High-</strong>, <strong>Moderate-</strong>, and <strong>Low-Quality</strong>) is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Question (KQ) 1: What fractionation schemes have been shown to be effective for the treatment of pain and/or prevention of morbidity from peripheral bone metastases?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Statement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>An updated review of high-quality data continues to show pain relief equivalency following a single 8 Gy fraction, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 24 Gy in 6 fractions, and 30 Gy in 10 fractions for patients with previously unirradiated painful bone metastases. Patients should be made aware that single-fraction (SF) radiation therapy (RT) is associated with a higher incidence of retreatment to the same painful site than is fractionated treatment. (<strong>High Quality Evidence, Strong Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KQ 2: When is SF RT appropriate for the treatment of pain and/or prevention of morbidity from uncomplicated bone metastasis involving the spine or other critical structures?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Statement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>A single 8 Gy fraction provides noninferior pain relief compared with a more prolonged RT course in painful spinal sites and may therefore be particularly convenient and sensible for patients with limited life expectancy. (<strong>High Quality Evidence, Strong Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KQ 3: Are there long-term side-effect risks that should limit the use of SF therapy?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Statement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>There continues to be no suggestion from available high-quality data that SF therapy produces unacceptable rates of long-term side effects that might limit its use for patients with painful bone metastases. The evidence regarding an association between higher risk for pathologic fracture after SF therapy versus fractionated therapy remains equivocal. (<strong>High Quality Evidence, Strong Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KQ 4: When should patients receive retreatment with radiation to peripheral bone metastases?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Statement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with persistent or recurrent pain more than 1 month following EBRT for symptomatic, peripheral bone metastases should be considered for retreatment while adhering to normal tissue dosing constraints described in the available literature. (<strong>High Quality Evidence, Strong Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KQ 5: When should patients receive retreatment with radiation to spine lesions causing recurrent pain?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Statement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with recurrent spine pain more than 1 month after initial treatment should be considered for EBRT retreatment while adhering to normal tissue dosing constraints described in the available literature. (<strong>High Quality Evidence, Strong Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KQ 6: What promise does highly conformal RT hold for the primary treatment of painful bone metastasis?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Statement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Advanced RT techniques such as SBRT as the primary treatment for painful spine bone lesions or for spinal cord compression should be considered in the setting of a clinical trial or with data collected in a registry given that insufficient data are available to routinely support this treatment currently. (<strong>Moderate Quality Evidence, Strong Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KQ 7: When should highly conformal RT be considered for retreatment of spine lesions causing recurrent pain?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Statement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Advanced radiation techniques such as SBRT retreatment for recurrent pain in spine bone lesions may be feasible, effective, and safe, but the panel recommends that this approach should be limited to clinical trial participation or on a registry given limited data supporting routine use. (<strong>Moderate Quality Evidence, Strong Recommendation</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KQ 8: Does the use of surgery, radionuclides, bisphosphonates, or kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty obviate the need for palliative RT for painful bone metastasis?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Statement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>The panel reiterates that the use of surgery, radionuclides, bisphosphonates, or kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty does not obviate the need for EBRT for patients with painful bone metastases, although 1 recent trial has suggested the potential for similar, albeit less rapid, bone pain relief in prostate cancer patients following an infusion of ibandronate when compared with a single fraction of EBRT. (<strong>Moderate Quality Evidence, Strong Recommendation</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><em>High-Quality Evidence</em></p>
<p>Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><em>Moderate-Quality Evidence</em></p>
<p>Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><em>Low-Quality Evidence</em></p>
<p>Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose&ndash;response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Grading of Guideline Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><em>Strong Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Evidence suggests that the benefit of the intervention outweighs the risk, or vice versa, and the panel has reached uniform consensus.</p>
<p><em>Weak Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Evidence suggests that the benefit of the intervention equals the risk, or vice versa, and the panel has reached uniform or non-uniform consensus.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A systematic review was initially conducted by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) staff of English-language studies in PubMed published between the last date searched in the original guideline, December 22, 2009, and June 17, 2014. Following approval of the update proposal, the review was extended through January 7, 2015. Terms common to all searches included: bone metastasis, bone metastases, radiation, and radiotherapy. Additional specific terms were incorporated for each Key Question (KQ) (see Appendix A in the original guideline document for literature search strategies). The outcomes of interest were overall and progression-free survival, recurrence, toxicity, and quality of life.</p>
<p>In total, 414 references meeting the inclusion criteria were retrieved by the PubMed searches and reviewed first by ASTRO staff and then by the whole panel. The inclusion criteria were: age &ge;18 years; bone metastases that were previously unirradiated or causing recurrent pain after radiation therapy; and treatment with external beam RT (EBRT), intensity modulated RT, or stereotactic body RT (SBRT) with or without bisphosphonates, radiopharmaceuticals, kyphoplasty, or vertebroplasty. The exclusion criteria were: nonhuman, dosimetric-only, case report, and conference abstract. The results were further refined to include only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, or prospective studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In May 2014, the guidelines subcommittee convened a work group to review available evidence and recommend whether the bone metastases guideline should be withdrawn, updated, or left intact. The group comprised 1 co-lead of the original guideline, 3 topic experts (2 not involved in the original guideline), and 4 guidelines subcommittee members. After review of new literature, the work group recommended an update of all Key Questions (KQs) from the original guideline and the proposal was approved by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Board of Directors in November 2014. The update panel was identical to the work group. Through calls and e-mails, the panel formulated recommendation statements and narratives based on the literature review.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grading of Evidence and Recommendations and Consensus Methodology </span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendation statements (see the "Major Recommendations" field) were developed based on high-quality evidence in accordance with Institute of Medicine standards. Panel consensus was evaluated in 2 rounds through a modified Delphi approach. In an online survey, panelists rated agreement with each recommendation on a 5-point Likert scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree. A prespecified threshold of &ge;75% "agree" or "strongly agree" responses indicated consensus. Following the first round, the recommendations for KQs 4 and 5, which cover reirradiation, were updated to emphasize the need for adherence to normal tissue constraints. The recommendations for KQs 6 and 7, addressing the role of highly conformal radiation therapy, initially failed to reach consensus and were revised to clarify the level of current evidence and the settings in which advanced technologies should be used. These 4 recommendations were re-rated and the results replaced those from the first round.</p>
<p>The strength of the recommendation and supporting evidence were rated using the American College of Physicians process (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields). A strong recommendation indicated "benefit of the intervention outweighs the risk, or vice versa, and the panel has reached uniform consensus." A weak recommendation showed "benefit of the intervention equals the risk, or vice versa, and the panel has reached uniform or nonuniform consensus." The chair initially assigned the ratings, which the panel later approved.</p></div>
