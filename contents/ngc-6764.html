Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (I-III) and levels of recommendation (A-C) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>

<p><strong>The following conclusion is based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A)</strong>:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Iron supplementation decreases the prevalence of maternal anemia at delivery.</li></ul>

<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on limited or inconsistent evidence (Level B)</strong>:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, and perinatal mortality.</li>

<li>Severe anemia with maternal hemoglobin (Hgb) levels less than 6 g/dL has been associated with abnormal fetal oxygenation resulting in nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns, reduced amniotic fluid volume, fetal cerebral vasodilatation, and fetal death. Thus, maternal transfusion should be considered for fetal indications.</li></ul>

<p><strong>The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>All pregnant women should be screened for anemia, and those with iron deficiency anemia should be treated with supplemental iron, in addition to prenatal vitamins.</li>

<li>Patients with anemia other than iron deficiency anemia should be further evaluated.</li>

<li>Failure to respond to iron therapy should prompt further investigation and may suggest an incorrect diagnosis, coexisting disease, malabsorption (sometimes caused by the use of enteric-coated tablets or concomitant use of antacids), noncompliance, or blood loss.</li></ul>

<p><strong><u>Definitions</u></strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>

<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</p>

<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>

<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case&#8211;control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>

<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>

<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>

<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>

<p><strong>Level A</strong> - Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Level B</strong> - Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Level C</strong> - Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>2008 Original Guideline</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG's) own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 1985 and September 2007. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles.</p>
<p><strong>2013 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>The NCBI database was searched from 2008 to 2013. Committee members conducted a literature search with the assistance from the ACOG Resource Center staff who routinely perform the Practice Bulletin literature searches.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>2008 Original Guideline</strong></p>
<p>Analysis of available evidence was given priority in formulating recommendations. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists were used. See also the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field regarding Grade C recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>2013 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>The Committee on Practice Bulletins - Obstetrics met in March 2013 and reaffirmed this document. A committee member reviewed the document and new literature on the topic. The document was then reviewed by the committee and the committee agreed that it is current and accurate.</p></div>
