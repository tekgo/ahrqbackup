            <p class="Note">*These recommendations are applicable to both sound surfaces and noncavitated carious lesions: "Noncavitated lesions are characterized by a change in color, glossiness, or surface structure as a result of demineralization before there is macroscopic breakdown in surface tooth structure. These lesions represent areas with net mineral loss due to an imbalance between demineralization and remineralization. Reestablishing a balance between demineralization and remineralization may stop the caries disease process while leaving a visible clinical sign of past disease."<br />
            <br />
            &dagger;The guideline panel suggests that clinicians should take into account the likelihood of experiencing lack of retention when choosing the type of sealant material most appropriate for a specific patient and clinical scenario. For example, in situations in which dry isolation is difficult, such as a tooth that is not fully erupted and has soft tissue impinging on the area to be sealed, then a material that is more hydrophilic (for example, glass ionomer) would be preferable to a hydrophobic resin-based sealant. On the other hand, if the tooth can be isolated to ensure a dry site and long-term retention is desired, then a resin-based sealant may be preferable.</p>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The systematic review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) report follows the guidance of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection Criteria for the Studies in the Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Type of Studies</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers included parallel and split-mouth randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least 2 years of follow-up. They excluded quasi-randomized trials, nonrandomized trials, and observational studies.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Participants</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers included studies that involved children, adolescents, and adults from the general population who did or did not have a history of carious lesions and who had either a sound occlusal surface or a noncavitated carious lesion in primary and permanent molars.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Interventions</strong></p>
<p>For the systematic review, the reviewers defined 4 categories of sealant materials: resin-based sealants, glass ionomer (GI) cements or GI sealants, resin-modified GI sealants, and polyacid-modified resins. They classified resin-modified GI sealants as a subcategory of the GI sealants category and polyacid-modified resins as a subcategory of the resin-based sealants category. They defined "intervention" as any of the 4 types of sealant materials described previously, irrespective of the application technique. They excluded studies whose investigators used sealant materials that were not commercially available at the time of this review. They defined "comparison" as any type of sealant material irrespective of the application technique, the nonplacement of sealants, or the use of fluoride varnishes.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers defined "caries incidence" as the identification of a new carious lesion on the occlusal surface of a primary or permanent molar that compromised dentin tissue. They defined "lack of retention" as the complete detachment or retention loss of the sealant material from the grooves and pits in the occlusal surface of a tooth with no macroscopically visible sealant material. They defined "adverse effects" as any potential adverse effect defined by the authors of the primary studies. For all outcomes, they grouped the studies into 3 categories according to the length of follow-up: 2 to 3 years, 4 to 7 years, and 7 or more years.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Methods for the Identification of Studies</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Electronic Databases</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from January 1971 to May 2013. They searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from June 2013 to May 2016. They used a combination of key words and controlled vocabulary that they adapted for each electronic database. They used filters, such as the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy, for identifying randomized trials (see the Appendix to the systematic review).</p>
<p><strong>Other Type of Resources</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify completed or ongoing RCTs that were not yet published and indexed in the regular electronic indices. They also screened the reference lists of included studies from previous systematic reviews to ensure that they had not omitted relevant studies. They did not exclude any studies on the basis of the status or language of publication.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Data Collection</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Selection of Studies</strong></p>
<p>In the first stage, 2 reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved references by using a standardized form. Because they used an inclusive criterion, when the reviewers disagreed on the eligibility status for a particular reference, they included the citation in question at this stage and resolved the disagreement at the full-text screening stage. In the second stage, 2 reviewers independently screened the full text of all potentially eligible studies. They resolved any disagreement by means of discussion. When consensus was elusive, a third reviewer, acting as an arbiter, decided final eligibility.</p></div>

<h3>
Number of Source Documents
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The search process resulted in 2,869 references, which the reviewers screened to assess their titles and abstracts; they excluded 2,419 references at that stage of the search process. Next, they excluded 426 articles, which they had assessed by means of full-text screenings, and they included 24 articles, which represented 23 studies, in this review.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction and Management</strong></p>
<p>Using a standardized form, 2 reviewers independently extracted data from all the included studies. The form included instructions to extract the main characteristics of the studies, including the type of study design (parallel, split-mouth), population (age, sex, selection criteria, caries history, clinical diagnosis of the occlusal surface to be sealed), type of sealant material and the comparison (nonuse of sealant or an active comparator), and the outcomes (specific definition from the primary study and results). When these reviewers identified discrepancies that they were unable to clarify, a third reviewer acted as arbiter.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of the Risk of Bias of Included Studies</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently conducted an assessment of the risk of bias for each included study by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The reviewers assessed the following types of bias in each study: selection bias (Was allocation randomized and concealed to ensure comparability between groups?), detection bias (Were the patients and outcome assessors unaware of which treatment was applied?), attrition bias (Were dropout rates sufficiently low to ensure that groups were still comparable at follow-up?), reporting bias (Did investigators selectively report outcomes?), and other sources of bias. For each domain, they determined whether a study had a high, low, or unclear risk of bias. The reviewers considered randomization sequence generation and allocation concealment to be the most important domains for the overall assessment of risk of bias. They resolved any disagreements by means of discussion until they reached consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Measures of Treatment Effect and Missing Data</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers analyzed caries incidence, lack of retention, and adverse events as dichotomous outcomes. For studies in which the investigators reported sealants as being fully retained, partially retained, and not retained, they grouped the fully and partially retained events and compared them with the sealants that were not retained to create the estimate. They calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both outcomes. For each study, they calculated the proportion of missing participant data, and they determined to what extent the amount of missing data was substantial enough to change the magnitude and direction of the estimates to the point of dramatically changing the conclusions, as suggested by Akl and colleagues. Otherwise, the reviewers used complete case analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Heterogeneity</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers conducted the assessment of heterogeneity by following the guidance of the <em>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</em>. They used the &chi;<sup>2</sup> test to determine the presence of statistical heterogeneity, and they set the level of significance at .1. In addition, they quantified the amount of heterogeneity among studies using the <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> statistic, in which they considered a value of <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> 40% or less to be unimportant heterogeneity, a value of <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> from 30% through 60% to be moderate heterogeneity, a value of <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> from 50% through 90% to be substantial heterogeneity, and a value of <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> from 70% through 100% to be considerable heterogeneity.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Publication Bias</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers conducted the assessment of publication bias by following the recommendations from the <em>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention</em>. If they noted that an outcome was informed by more than 10 studies, then they explored publication bias by using funnel plots.</p>
<p><strong>Data Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>Investigators of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) who measured the effectiveness of interventions to prevent carious lesions typically used 1 of 2 designs: split-mouth or parallel. In RCTs whose investigators used a parallel design, the investigators allocated study participants to receive either the experimental treatment or a control. In split-mouth trials, the investigators randomly assigned 1 of 2 treatments (for example, sealant versus no sealant) to the same type of tooth on the right and left sides of the participant's mouth. One advantage of conducting split-mouth trials is that these types of RCTs minimize variability among study participants, as the intervention and control teeth are in the same person's mouth. One potential issue, however, is that the preventive benefits of the intervention may carry over to the control teeth. The reviewers judged these carryover effects to be minimal for sealants, and therefore, they pooled the findings from studies whose investigators had used each of these designs to create a single effect estimate by using the methodology proposed by Lesaffre and colleagues and Elbourne and colleagues. The reviewers used Review Manager (RevMan), Version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration) to conduct the analysis. To obtain the pooled estimate, they used the generic inverse-variance method with a random-effects model. When they included fewer than 4 studies in the meta-analysis, they used a fixed-effects model.</p>
<p><strong>Subgroup Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers conducted subgroup analysis to determine whether the studies whose investigators had enrolled participants with noncavitated pit-and-fissure occlusal carious lesions, sound occlusal surfaces, and those who had both (that is, a population who had a mix of both sound occlusal surfaces and noncavitated carious lesions) had different treatment effects. For the interaction test, they used a level of significance of .05.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of the Quality of the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers determined the quality of the evidence (certainty in the estimates of effect) for each outcome by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. With the GRADE approach, RCTs start as high-quality evidence; however, the quality or certainty in the body of evidence decreases to moderate-, low-, or very low&ndash;quality evidence if serious or very serious issues related to risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias are present (see Table 1 in the systematic review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Two reviewers independently conducted these evaluations.</p></div>

<p>To assist the guideline panel with formulating recommendations and grading the strength of the recommendations, they used the evidence-to-decision framework, including the following domains: balance between the desirable and undesirable consequences (net effect), certainty in the evidence (also called quality of the evidence), patients' values and preferences, and resource use. According to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the strength of a recommendation is either strong or conditional, in which each grade of the strength has different implications for patients, clinicians, and policy makers (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were formulated collectively via 3 videoconferences with members of the guideline panel and methodologists from the ADA Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry and the AAPD held in January 2016. Deliberation and consensus were the main methods to develop these recommendations using the "evidence-to-decision" framework. When consensus was elusive, the panel was presented with the positions under assessment, and it voted accordingly.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The panel highlighted that a number of studies have shown that sealing children's and adolescents' permanent molars reduces costs to the health system by delaying and preventing the need for invasive restorative treatment, particularly when these patients are classified as having an "elevated caries risk" (that is, previous caries experience). Under these conditions, dental sealants seem to be a cost-effective intervention.</p></div>

Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The panel highlighted that a number of studies have shown that sealing children's and adolescents' permanent molars reduces costs to the health system by delaying and preventing the need for invasive restorative treatment, particularly when these patients are classified as having an "elevated caries risk" (that is, previous caries experience). </li>
    <li>The evidence shows that sealants available in the United States (U.S.) market at the time of the systematic review are an effective intervention for reducing the incidence of carious lesions in the occlusal surfaces of primary and permanent molars in children and adolescents compared with the nonuse of sealants or fluoride varnishes. This benefit is inclusive to both sound occlusal surfaces and noncavitated occlusal carious lesions. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There has been concern that dental sealants might exhibit adverse effects. This is primarily associated with bisphenol A (BPA). It has been suggested that the BPA present in some sealants may have estrogen-like effects; however, the evidence does not support the transient effect of a small amount of BPA in placing patients at risk. Studies also have evaluated the correlation of developing carious lesions in teeth with fully or partially lost sealants and found no greater risk than in teeth that had never been sealed. Two randomized controlled trials measuring the occurrence of adverse effects associated with sealants found no events related to this outcome.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Clinicians should use these recommendations but consider carefully individual patient factors, especially where the guideline panel offered conditional recommendations. In addition, sealant use should be increased along with other preventive interventions to manage the caries disease process, especially in patients with an elevated risk of developing caries. Further research is needed to provide more risk-oriented recommendations, particularly regarding the development of a valid and reliable chairside tool for clinicians to assess a patient's caries risk.</p></div>
