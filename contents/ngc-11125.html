Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of recommendation (<strong>1A&ndash;2C, consensus-based [CB]</strong>) and the approach to rating the quality of evidence are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests that the cough be managed according to a published management guideline that initially considers the most common potential etiologies as well as symptomatic gastroesophageal reﬂux (<strong>ungraded, consensus based</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Common potential etiologies include environmental or occupational irritants, primary or secondary smoking, use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, abnormal chest radiographic ﬁndings, asthma, upper airway cough syndrome due to a variety of rhinosinus conditions, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, and suppurative lung disease. Often, more than one etiology is a contributing factor.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough suspected to be due to reﬂux-cough syndrome, the Expert Panel recommends that treatment include (1) diet modiﬁcation to promote weight loss in overweight or obese patients; (2) head of bed elevation and avoiding meals within 3 hours of bedtime; and (3) in patients who report heartburn and regurgitation, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists, alginate, or antacid therapy sufﬁcient to control these symptoms (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: (1) While it is expected that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms will respond within 4-8 weeks, the literature suggests that improvement in cough may take up to 3 months. (2) Head of bed elevation is suggested based on its utility for improving GI gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms while acknowledging that it has not been demonstrated to be beneﬁcial for cough.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult patients with suspected chronic cough due to reﬂux-cough syndrome, but without heartburn or regurgitation, the Expert Panel recommends against using PPI therapy alone because it is unlikely to be effective in resolving the cough (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough potentially due to reﬂux-cough syndrome who are refractory to a 3-month trial of medical antireﬂux therapy and are being evaluated for surgical management (antireﬂux or bariatric), or in whom there is strong clinical suspicion warranting diagnostic testing for gastroesophageal reﬂux, the Expert Panel suggests that they undergo esophageal manometry and pH-metry with conventional methodology (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Esophageal manometry is done both to evaluate for a major motility disorder and to accurately position the pH electrode for the pH monitoring study. With conventional methodology, the pH electrode is placed 5 cm proximal to the lower esophageal sphincter, and the study is done off antisecretory medications after withholding PPI therapy for 7 days and H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists for 3 days prior to the study. It was agreed by consensus of the Esophageal Diagnostic Advisory Panel composed of both gastroenterologists and surgeons that this is the only methodology with proven validity with respect to surgical outcomes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough and a major motility disorder (e.g., absent peristalsis, achalasia, distal esophageal spasm, hypercontractility) and/or normal acid exposure time in the distal esophagus, the Expert Panel suggests not advising antireﬂux surgery (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Under the circumstances of a major motility disorder or normal esophageal acid exposure on esophageal pH-metry, there is no supportive controlled data for antireﬂux surgery and there is quantiﬁable risk to the procedure making for an unacceptable risk-beneﬁt ratio.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult patients with chronic cough, adequate peristalsis, and abnormal esophageal acid exposure determined by pH-metry in whom medical therapy has failed the Expert Panel suggests antireﬂux (or bariatric when appropriate) surgery for presumed reﬂux-cough syndrome (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: With respect to deﬁning adequate peristalsis, there is no consensus. Some consider any preserved peristalsis to be adequate while others stipulate that it must be at least 30% and others at least 50% of normal.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>The methods used for this systematic review conformed to those outlined in the article "Methodologies for the Development of American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guidelines and Expert Panel Reports" (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Systematic reviews and clinical trials were identiﬁed from searches of electronic databases (Ovid Medline, and EMBASE) commencing from the earliest available date until May 2015. A search of the Cochrane database returned 82 articles, eight of which were sufﬁciently relevant for full text review; however, none met criteria for inclusion in this review. The reference lists of retrieved articles were examined for additional citations. The search terms used were ("Gastroesophageal Reﬂux" [MeSH] OR GERD OR GORD OR reﬂux OR gastroesophageal reﬂux disease OR reﬂux esophagitis OR nonerosive reﬂux disease OR NERD) AND ("Proton Pump Inhibitors" [MeSH] OR PPI OR omeprazole OR lansoprazole OR pantoprazole OR rabeprazole OR esomeprazole OR tenatoprazole OR "Histamine H2 Antagonists" [MeSH] OR prokinetic OR surgery) AND cough. The titles and abstracts of the search results were independently evaluated by two reviewers to identify potentially relevant articles. The full texts of all potentially relevant articles were retrieved, and two reviewers independently reviewed all retrieved studies. A third reviewer was available to adjudicate any disagreements.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The results of the literature search for the first question appear in Figure 1 in the original guideline document. The search initially identified 1,870 citations. After the removal of 354 duplicates, 1,516 records were screened, with 541 being excluded on the basis of irrelevant titles and 119 on the basis of being relevant to pediatrics. Hence, 842 abstracts were reviewed. Among these, 14 were controlled medical trials potentially pertinent to PICO question #1. The results of the search for the second question appear in Figure 2 in the original guideline document. Initial searching identified 1,877 records. After the removal of 354 duplicates, 1,523 records were screened, with 541 being excluded on the basis of irrelevant titles and 119 on the basis of being relevant to pediatrics. Hence, 849 abstracts were reviewed. Among these, 14 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and deemed pertinent for qualitative synthesis for inclusion. The additional seven studies for PICO question 2 were identified in the recent publication on intervention fidelity.</p></div>

Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Based on the Grades of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, quality of evidence (also known as certainty of evidence) is defined as the extent to which confidence in the effect estimate is adequate to support a recommendation. The quality of evidence is categorized as high (A level), moderate (B level), or low (includes very low) (C level). The rating of the quality of evidence reflects the strengths and limitations of the body of evidence and was based on the study design, risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of results, and likelihood of publication bias, in addition to factors specific to observational studies (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p></div>

<p>Included articles underwent methodological assessment. For the randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quality assessment was carried out with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool if the following criteria were met: (1) study excluded other common causes of chronic cough (asthma, upper airway cough syndrome [UACS]) by adequate workup <em>and</em> (2) included patients both with and without additional symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reﬂux (LPR), or both, <em>or</em> included patients with and without additional test results suggestive of GERD or LPR, or both.

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Expert Panel used the published methodology of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guideline Oversight Committee to select the Expert Cough Panel Chair and the International Panel of Experts to perform a systematic review and synthesis of evidence and to develop recommendations and practice management suggestions. After generating the key clinical questions for this systematic review, population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) elements were derived to inform the literature review. The questions were formulated after polling the existing writing group for key clinical questions related to chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This returned a list of 20 questions that were then synthesized into two PICO questions that were sufﬁciently broad to capture most of the detail from those 20 questions. The resultant PICO questions that formed the basis of the subsequent systematic review are stated in Table 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The questions that formed the basis of the systematic review were the following: (1) Can therapy intended to treat gastroesophageal reﬂux improve or eliminate cough in adults with refractory chronic cough? (2) Are there minimal clinical criteria to guide clinical practice in determining that a patient's chronic cough is likely to respond to therapy for gastroesophageal reﬂux?</p>
<p>The ﬁndings of the systematic review were used to support the evidence-graded recommendations or suggestions. A structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on guidance statements. In this regard, for a recommendation or suggestion to be approved by the Expert Cough Panel, 75% of the eligible panel members had to vote, and 80% of those voting had to strongly agree or agree with the statement. Quality assessment also included grading the strength of recommendations based on consideration of the balance of beneﬁts to harms, patient values and preferences, and the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation. Harms incorporated risks and burdens to the patients that can include convenience or lack of convenience, difﬁculty of administration, and invasiveness.</p></div>
