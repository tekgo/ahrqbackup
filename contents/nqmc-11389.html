<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of all patient-months for patients whose delivered dose of dialysis (either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) met the specified threshold during the reporting period.</p>
<p>This Kt/V dialysis adequacy comprehensive clinical measure includes the following four components:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Delivered dose of hemodialysis above minimum (see the related <a href="/summaries/summary/51307" title="Measure Summary #11385" target="_blank">National Quality Measures Clearinghouse [NQMC] summary</a>) </li>
    <li>Delivered dose of peritoneal dialysis above minimum (see the related <a href="/summaries/summary/51308" title="Measure Summary #11386" target="_blank">NQMC summary</a>) </li>
    <li>Minimum single pool (sp)Kt/V for pediatric hemodialysis patients (see the related <a href="/summaries/summary/51309" title="Measure Summary #11387" target="_blank">NQMC summary</a>) </li>
    <li>Delivered dose of pediatric peritoneal dialysis above minimum (see the related <a href="/summaries/summary/51310" title="Measure Summary #11388" target="_blank">NQMC summary</a>) </li>
</ul></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The primary rationale for this combined measure is to make more facilities eligible for public reporting of these metrics by meeting the greater than 11 eligible patients restriction. For public reporting on Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) and the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP), a facility has to treat at least 11 qualifying patients for each measure in order to receive a score on that measure. The 11 patient requirement is anchored in Health and Human Services (HHS) policy, related to small cell sizes to protect identification of patients and release of protected health information. An additional reason is the need for sufficient data to achieve reliability of a measure calculation for less than 11 patients. The developer recognizes there is no published evidence describing use of the combined subpopulation and modality measures. However, each component measure has strong evidence support from literature and each also reflects consensus guideline recommendations. Combining these established consensus measures to counter an unintended consequence of the application of federal protected health information regulations should not require additional scientific justification beyond what already exists.</p>
<p>In the case of dialysis adequacy, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) found that a significant number of facilities that have less than 11 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients or less than 11 pediatric patients would be included in the new combined measures but excluded from the individual measure, leading to the systematic exclusion of these facilities from assessment on these measures because of the reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To account for this, CMS proposed the three new measures that assess dialysis adequacy by modality that includes both adult and pediatric populations, and an overall measure of all adult and pediatric hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. CMS also seeks maintenance endorsement of the individual measures previously endorsed, based on the same level of evidence presented for those measures. It is CMS's intention to eventually retire the individual measures once the combined measures are endorsed and implemented.</p></div>
