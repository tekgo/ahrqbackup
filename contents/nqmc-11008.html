<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 50 to 75 years receiving a screening colonoscopy without biopsy or polypectomy who had a recommended follow-up interval of at least 10 years for repeat colonoscopy documented in their colonoscopy report.</p>
<p>This measure is to be reported a minimum of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">once per reporting period</span> for patients seen during the reporting period. Performance for this measure is not limited to the reporting period. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In the average-risk population, colonoscopy screening is recommended in all current guidelines at 10-year intervals. Inappropriate interval recommendations can result in overuse of resources and can lead to significant patient harm. Performing colonoscopy too often not only increases patients' exposure to procedural harm, but also drains resources that could be more effectively used to adequately screen those in need (Lieberman, 2008). The most common serious complication of colonoscopy is post-polypectomy bleeding (Levin et al., 2008). </p>
<p>Variations in the recommended time interval between colonoscopies exist for patients with normal colonoscopy findings. In a 2006 study of 1282 colonoscopy reports, recommendations were consistent with contemporaneous guidelines in only 39.2% of cases and with current guidelines in 36.7% of cases. Further, the adjusted mean number of years in which repeat colonoscopy was recommended was 7.8 years following normal colonoscopy (Krist et al., 2007). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>: </p>
<p>At present, colonoscopy (CSPY) every 10 years is an acceptable option for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in average-risk adults beginning at age 50 years (Levin et al., 2008). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2008) recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until the age of 75 years. The risks and benefits of these screening methods vary.</p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends against "routine" screening for colorectal cancer in adults 76 to 85 years of age who have been adequately screened. There may be considerations that support colorectal cancer screening in an individual patient (USPSTF, 2008). The preferred CRC prevention test is colonoscopy every 10 years, beginning at age 50 (Rex et al., 2009). </p></div>
