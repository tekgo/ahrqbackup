Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of current substance abuse or dependence who were screened for depression within the 12 month reporting period.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Depression is one of the most common co-occurring psychiatric conditions in patients with substance use disorders and a condition for which a variety of screening methods have proven effective. Identifying depression and other co-occurring psychiatric disorders in patients with substance use disorders is essential for proper management and key to developing an integrated treatment approach, which is associated with better outcomes. Despite its importance, research has shown that more than 30&#37; of patients with risk factors for depression, including alcohol or other drug abuse, were not asked about the presence or absence of depression or depressive symptoms.</p>

<p class="Note">The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <u>verbatim</u> from the referenced clinical guidelines (from the American Psychiatric Association [APA]) and represent the evidence base for the measure:</p>

<p class="Note">All patients with a substance use disorder should be carefully assessed for the presence of co-occurring psychiatric disorders, including additional substance use disorders. (APA, 2006)</p>

<p class="Note">All positive screening tests should trigger full diagnostic interviews that use standard diagnostic criteria (i.e., those from the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-IV]) to determine the presence or absence of specific depressive disorders, such as major depression and/or dysthymia. The severity of depression and comorbid psychological problems (e.g., anxiety, panic attacks, or substance abuse) should be addressed. (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2002)</p>

<p class="Note">In general, treatment of depressive symptoms of moderate to severe intensity should begin concurrently or soon after initiating treatment of the co-occurring substance use disorder, particularly if there is evidence of prior mood episodes. In individuals without prior episodes of depression or a family history of mood disorders, it may be appropriate to delay the treatment of mild to moderate depressive symptoms for the purpose of diagnostic clarification. Clinicians are advised to monitor symptoms, assess and reassess for suicidal ideation, provide education, encourage abstinence from substances, and observe changes in mental status during the substance-free period while actively considering whether antidepressant intervention is indicated. (APA, 2006)</p></div>
