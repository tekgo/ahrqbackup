Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adolescent females 16 to 20 years of age who were screened unnecessarily for cervical cancer.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There are multiple medical societies and evidence-based guidelines which recommend against cervical cancer screening in a general population of females under 21 years of age; however, fewer than 25 percent of clinicians provide care consistent with guidelines (Morioka-Douglas &amp; Hillard, 2013; Yabroff et al., 2009). Although screening has been shown to be highly effective in the 21 to 65 age group, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) determined there is adequate evidence that screening women younger than 21&mdash;regardless of sexual history&mdash;does not reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer, compared with beginning screening at 21. The USPSTF found evidence that screening in the younger age group leads to more harm than benefit because abnormal test results are likely to be transient and to resolve on their own, and resulting treatment may have an adverse effect on future child-bearing. Thus, the USPSTF specifically recommends against screening women under 21 years of age. </p>
<p>This measure has the potential to decrease the use of non-recommended cervical cancer screening in adolescent females and to ensure that providers follow recommended guidelines. Adherence to guidelines could prevent adolescent females from experiencing harm, including more-frequent testing and invasive diagnostic procedures (such as colposcopy and cervical biopsy), in addition to short-term increase in anxiety and distress that results from abnormal test results. Additionally, this measure has the potential to decrease the financial burden associated with inappropriate screening practices (Hawkes et al., 1996). </p></div>
