<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>Thromboembolic disease is a common occurrence in patients who have sustained a cervical spinal cord injury and is associated with significant morbidity. <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence exists demonstrating the efficacy of several means of prophylaxis for the prevention of thromboembolic events. Therefore, patients with SCI should be treated with a regimen aimed at VTE prophylaxis.</p>
<p>Although low dose heparin therapy has been reported to be effective as prophylaxis for thromboembolism in several <strong>Class III</strong> studies, other <strong>Class I, Class II</strong>, and <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence indicates that better alternatives than low dose heparin therapy exist. These alternatives include the use of LMWH, adjusted dose heparin, or anticoagulation in conjunction with rotating beds, pneumatic compression devices or electrical stimulation. Oral anticoagulation alone does not appear to be as effective as these other measures used for prophylaxis.</p>
<p>There appears to be a DVT prophylaxis benefit to early anticoagulation in acute SCI patients. <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence supports beginning mechanical and chemical prophylaxis upon admission after SCI and holding chemical prophylaxis 1 day prior to and 1 day following surgical intervention.</p>
<p>The incidence of thromboembolic events appears to decrease over time and the prolonged use of anticoagulant therapy is associated with a definite incidence of bleeding complications. There are multiple reports of the beneficial effects of the prophylaxis therapy for 6 to 12 weeks following SCI. <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence indicates that the majority of thromboembolic events occur in the first 3 months following acute SCI and very few occur thereafter. For these reasons, it is recommended that prophylactic therapy be discontinued after 3 months unless the patient is at high risk for a future VTE event (previous thromboembolic events, obesity, advanced age). It is reasonable to discontinue therapy earlier in patients with retained lower extremity motor function after SCI, as the incidence of thromboembolic events in these patients is substantially lower than among those patients with motor complete injuries.</p>
<p>Although the guidelines author group concluded that caval filters appeared to be efficacious for the prevention of PE in SCI patients in the 2002 guideline on this topic, more recent medical evidence suggests that prophylactic filters may be more morbid than initially believed. Caval filters still have a role for SCI patients who have suffered thromboembolic events despite anticoagulation, and for SCI patients with contraindications to anticoagulation and/or the use of pneumatic compression devices.</p>
<p>There are several methods available for the diagnosis of DVT. Venography has long been considered the best test, but is invasive, not applicable to all patients, and is associated with intrinsic morbidity. Duplex Doppler ultrasound, impedance plethysmography, venous occlusion plethysmography and the clinical examination have been reported to have sensitivities of approximately 90% and are noninvasive. It is recommended that these noninvasive tests be used for the diagnosis of DVT in SCI patients and that venography to diagnose DVT be reserved for the rare situation when clinical suspicion is high and the results of ultrasound or plethysmography testing are negative.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search from 1966 through 2011 was performed using Medical Subject Headings in combination with "spinal cord injury": "deep venous thrombosis," "pulmonary embolism," and "thromboembolism." The search was limited to human studies reported in the English language. This resulted in 599 citations. Duplicate references, reviews, letters, and tangential reports were discarded. The bibliographies of these citations were analyzed for additional potential contributions. Finally, the author group found 45 citations describing the diagnosis, prophylaxis or treatment of thromboembolic disease in adult spinal cord injured patients make up the basis for this guideline. Supporting references included 4 evidence-based reviews on venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and treatment in a variety of patient populations. Finally, several series dealing with VTE in general trauma patients with results germane to a discussion of spinal cord injured patients are included in the bibliography as supporting documents.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Prolonged prophylactic anticoagulation therapy is not without risk, and is associated with bleeding complications. </li>
    <li>The placement of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters is not without complications. Several authors have described distal migration, intraperitoneal erosion, and symptomatic IVC occlusion in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) treated with IVC filters. One group of researchers has hypothesized that quadriplegic patients are at higher risk for complications from IVC filter placement due to loss of abdominal muscle tone, as well as their requisite use of the "quad cough" maneuver. </li>
    <li>Venography has been considered the best test for diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but is too inaccurate, is not possible in all patients, is invasive, and expensive. A 10% incidence of adverse effects from venography including post-venographic phlebitis and allergic reactions has been reported. </li>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
