Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children enrolled in two consecutive years who received a comprehensive or periodic oral evaluation as a dental service in both years.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: </p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This measure is reported at the "dental" services level. The measure specification can be adapted to include the option to report separate rates for "oral health" services and for "dental OR oral health" services. </li>
    <li>Services provided by a dental hygienist would only be counted as a "dental" service if those services are provided under the supervision of a dentist. Services provided by independently practicing dental hygienists and other such providers would be classified as "oral health" services. </li>
    <li>The measure can be used for children under age 21 when reporting for Medicaid program. For use within the context of the Public Marketplace, under age 19 will apply. </li>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States. In 2009 to 2010, 14% of children aged 3 to 5 years had untreated dental caries. Among children aged 6 to 9 years, 17% had untreated dental caries, and among adolescents aged 13 to 15, 11% had untreated dental caries. Identifying caries early is important to reverse the disease process, prevent progression of caries, and reduce incidence of future lesions. Approximately three quarters of children younger than age 6 years did not have at least one visit to a dentist in the previous year.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

<div class='field field_picklist-choice'>
<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A clinical practice guideline or other peer-reviewed synthesis of the clinical research evidence

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Oral health is essential to the general health and well-being of all Americans. Poor oral health can have a significant impact on children's overall health, growth and development, and learning. Between 1990 and 2009, Medicaid dental expenditures grew from $756.1 million to $7.1 billion, or from 2.4% to 7.0% of total dental expenditures. </p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), dental caries remains the most common chronic disease of children aged 5 to 17 years&mdash;4 times more common than asthma (59% versus 15%). Ten million United States (U.S.) school age children have untreated decay, and there are profound disparities by race, socioeconomic status and geographic location. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2004 shows that one in four children aged 2 to 5 years had one or more teeth affected by dental caries (untreated or filled, excluding missing teeth) and one in two children are affected by age 6 to 11 years. One in ten children aged 6 to 8 have dental caries in the permanent dentition (untreated or filled, excluding missing teeth) and one in two children are affected by age 12 to 15 years. </p>
<p>Data collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) indicate a lack of utilization of care at younger ages, lack of early prevention, and lack of adequate use of effective preventive modalities underscoring the need for improvement. </p></div>
