Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Levels of evidence (<strong>I&ndash;V</strong>) and grades of recommendation (<strong>A&ndash;F</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: These recommendations and clinical practice guidelines are based on the scientific literature published prior to December 2016. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Diagnosis/Classification</strong></span></p>
<p>Physical therapists should diagnose the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) categories of Sprain and strain involving collateral ligament of knee, Sprain and strain involving cruciate ligament of knee, and Injury to multiple structures of knee, and the associated International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) impairment-based categories of knee instability (b7150 Stability of a single joint) and movement coordination impairments (b7601 Control of complex voluntary movements), using the following history and physical examination findings: mechanism of injury, passive knee laxity, joint pain, joint effusion, and movement coordination impairments. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong></span> </p>
<p>The clinician should suspect diagnostic classifications associated with serious pathological conditions when the individual's reported activity limitations and impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section of this guideline, or when the individual's symptoms are not resolving with intervention aimed at normalization of the individual's impairments of body function. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Examination</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures: Activity Limitations and Self-Reported Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use the International Knee Documentation Committee 2000 Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC 2000) or Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and may use the Lysholm scale, as validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess knee symptoms and function, and should use the Tegner activity scale or Marx Activity Rating Scale to assess activity level, before and after interventions intended to alleviate the physical impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions associated with knee ligament sprain. Clinicians may use the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) instrument as a validated patient-reported outcome measure to assess psychological factors that may hinder return to sports before and after interventions intended to alleviate fear of reinjury associated with knee ligament sprain. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Physical Performance Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should administer appropriate clinical or field tests, such as single-legged hop tests (e.g., single hop for distance, crossover hop for distance, triple hop for distance, and 6-meter timed hop), that can identify a patient's baseline status relative to pain, function, and disability; detect side-to-side asymmetries; assess global knee function; determine a patient's readiness to return to activities; and monitor changes in the patient's status throughout the course of treatment. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Physical Impairment Measures</strong></p>
<p>When evaluating a patient with ligament sprain over an episode of care, clinicians should use assessments of impairment of body structure and function, including measures of knee laxity/stability, lower-limb movement coordination, thigh muscle strength, knee effusion, and knee joint range of motion. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interventions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Continuous Passive Motion</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may use continuous passive motion in the immediate postoperative period to decrease postoperative pain after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Early Weight Bearing</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may implement early weight bearing as tolerated (within 1 week after surgery) for patients after ACL reconstruction. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Knee Bracing</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may use functional knee bracing in patients with ACL deficiency. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>) </p>
<p>Clinicians should elicit and document patient preferences in the decision to use functional knee bracing following ACL reconstruction, as evidence exists for and against its use. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: D</strong>) </p>
<p>Clinicians may use appropriate knee bracing for patients with acute posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries, severe medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries, or posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: F</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Immediate Versus Delayed Mobilization</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use immediate mobilization (within 1 week) after ACL reconstruction to increase joint range of motion, reduce joint pain, and reduce the risk of adverse responses of surrounding soft tissue structures, such as those associated with knee extension range-of-motion loss. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Cryotherapy</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use cryotherapy immediately after ACL reconstruction to reduce postoperative knee pain. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Supervised Rehabilitation</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use exercises as part of the in-clinic supervised rehabilitation program after ACL reconstruction and should provide and supervise the progression of a home-based exercise program, providing education to ensure independent performance. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Exercises</strong></p>
<p>Weight-bearing and non&ndash;weight-bearing concentric and eccentric exercises should be implemented within 4 to 6 weeks, 2 to 3 times per week for 6 to 10 months, to increase thigh muscle strength and functional performance after ACL reconstruction. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation</strong></p>
<p>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation should be used for 6 to 8 weeks to augment muscle strengthening exercises in patients after ACL reconstruction to increase quadriceps muscle strength and enhance short-term functional outcomes. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Neuromuscular Re-Education</strong></p>
<p>Neuromuscular re-education training should be incorporated with muscle strengthening exercises in patients with knee stability and movement coordination impairments. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The authors of this guideline revision worked with research librarians with expertise in systematic reviews to perform a systematic search for concepts associated with ligament injuries and instabilities of the knee for articles published since 2008 related to classification, examination, and intervention strategies consistent with previous guideline development methods related to International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) classification. Briefly, the following databases were searched from 2008 to December 2016: MEDLINE (PubMed; 2008 to date), Scopus (Elsevier; 2008 to date), CINAHL (EBSCO; 2008 to date), SPORTDiscus (EBSCO; 2008 to date), Cochrane Library (Wiley; 2008 to date). (See Appendix A in the original guideline document for full search strategies and Appendix B for search dates and results.) </p>
<p>Articles contributing to recommendations were reviewed based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria with the goal of identifying evidence relevant to physical therapist clinical decision making for adult persons with knee stability and movement coordination impairments/knee ligament sprain. The title and abstract of each article were reviewed independently by 2 members of the clinical practice guideline (CPG) development team for inclusion (see Appendix C in the original guideline document for inclusion and exclusion criteria). Full-text review was then similarly conducted to obtain the final set of articles for contribution to the recommendations. The team leader provided the final decision for discrepancies that were not resolved by the review team. For selected relevant topics that were not appropriate for the development of recommendations, such as incidence and imaging, articles were not subject to systematic review and were not included in the flow chart.</p></div>

<p>Individual clinical research articles were graded according to criteria adapted from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom for diagnostic, prospective, and therapeutic studies. In 3 teams of 2, each reviewer independently assigned a level of evidence and evaluated the quality of each article using a critical appraisal tool. See the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Evidence" field for the levels of evidence table and Appendix G in the original guideline document for details on procedures used for assigning levels of evidence. The evidence update was organized from highest level of evidence to lowest level.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Content experts were appointed by the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) to conduct a review of the literature and to develop an updated "Knee Stability and Movement Coordination Impairments: Knee Ligament Sprain" clinical practice guideline (CPG) as indicated by the current state of the evidence in the field. The aims of the revision were to provide a concise summary of the evidence since publication of the original guideline and to develop new recommendations or revise previously published recommendations to support evidence-based practice. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p>The strength of the evidence supporting the recommendations was graded according to the previously established methods for the 2010 guideline and those provided in the original guideline document. Each team developed recommendations based on the strength of evidence, including how directly the studies addressed the question on knee stability and movement coordination impairments/ knee ligament sprain population. In developing their recommendations, the authors considered the strengths and limitations of the body of evidence and the health benefits, side effects, and risks of tests and interventions.</p></div>

<p>Identified reviewers who are experts in knee ligament injury management and rehabilitation reviewed the content and methods of this clinical practice guideline (CPG) for integrity, accuracy, and to ensure that it fully represents the condition. Any comments, suggestions, or feedback from the expert reviewers were delivered to the authors and editors to consider and make appropriate revisions. These guidelines were also posted for public comment and review on the orthopt.org Web site, and a notification of this posting was sent to the members of the Orthopaedic Section, American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), Inc. Any comments, suggestions, and feedback gathered from public commentary were sent to the authors and editors to consider and make appropriate revisions in the guideline. In addition, a panel of consumer/patient representatives and external stakeholders, such as claims reviewers, medical coding experts, academic educators, clinical educators, physician specialists, and researchers, also reviewed the guideline and provided feedback and recommendations that were given to the authors and editors for further consideration and revisions. Last, a panel of consumer/patient representatives and external stakeholders and a panel of experts in physical therapy practice guideline methodology annually review the Orthopaedic Section, APTA's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)-based Clinical Practice Guideline Policies and provide feedback and comments to the Clinical Practice Guideline Coordinator and Editors to improve the APTA's guideline development and implementation processes. </p></div>

<p>These guidelines are not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of medical care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made based on clinician experience and expertise in light of the clinical presentation of the patient, the available evidence, available diagnostic and treatment options, and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences. However, it is suggested that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in the patient's medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.</p></div>
