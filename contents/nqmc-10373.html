<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Dehydration is a serious acute condition that occurs mostly in elderly patients and patients with other underlying illnesses. Dehydration for the most part can be treated in the outpatient setting. Dehydration is often preventable through attention and support for fluid intake, especially in patients at risk (Mentes, 2012; American Medical Directors Association [AMDA], 2009). Those at risk includes, but is not limited to, individuals with cognitive or psychiatric disorders, increased age, co-morbid illness requiring medications such as diuretics or laxatives, polypharmacy, diabetes, acute gastroenteritis, and living in areas with extreme heat (Wakefield et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2010; Khalaj et al., 2010). Dehydration is treatable with oral rehydration therapy and/or intravenous (IV) fluids and by addressing the underlying cause (Mentes, 2012; AMDA, 2009). If left untreated, serious complications are possible, including acute kidney injury and mortality (Mentes, 2012; AMDA, 2009). Clinical interventions may prevent serious complications. Examples of such interventions include phone triage and education to promote oral rehydration (Mentes, 2012; Hazratjee et al., 2013) early detection of dehydration (AMDA, 2009), and providing rapid access to treatment for those at highest risk (Konrad et al., 2012). Community interventions include air conditioning for the elderly during intense heat waves (Ostro et al., 2010). </p>
<p>Dehydration can be prevented by increased surveillance of patients at risk in the outpatient setting along with early identification and intervention. Patients with poor access to primary care providers, may seek treatment later, have less access to telephone triage and health education to support home-based management, and may be more likely to seek emergency care.</p>
<p>This measure is an avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) indicator. ACSC indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of outpatient care and other healthcare not related to hospitalizations. The underlying premise for these indicators is that high access to high quality outpatient care may prevent hospital admissions (Billing et al., 1993; van Loenen et al., 2014). In the case of dehydration, such access to high quality care can prevent complications necessitating inpatient admission through encouraging hydration during high risk events, such as gastroenteritis infections, early detection of dehydration, particularly among those that are at high risk for dehydration, and early and effective interventions. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), accountable care organizations (ACOs), or public health agencies. ACSC indicators correlate with each other and they may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a regional level.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Hospitalization rates for dehydration (Prevention Quality Indicator [PQI] 10) have been shown to be highest among blacks (1.3 times the rate among non-Hispanic whites in 2003) and lowest amongst Asians (Russo, Andrews, &amp; Coffey, 2006). Use of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) and State Inpatient Data (SID) data using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) PQI composite, demonstrated a decrease in the AHRQ PQI composite rate from 1,635 to 1,395 per 100,000 adults from 2001 to 2009 (Moy et al., 2013). Declines in potentially preventable hospitalization rates were observed across all income quartiles between these same years (years 2001 and 2009). In all years, rates of hospitalizations were higher among residents of neighborhoods in the three lower income quartiles compared with residents of neighborhoods in the highest income quartile (Moy et al., 2013). Income may be associated with access to care. In an earlier like study, when controlling for income there were no differences in race (Moy et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Dehydration is a common fluid and electrolyte disturbance in the adults, especially in the elderly. Dehydration is best treated by prevention. Once dehydration occurs, if not adequately treated, it can lead to hospitalization, renal failure, and or death. A common cause of dehydration in adults is gastroenteritis (Bresee et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2011). The most common cause of all forms of gastroenteritis in adults is the norovirus (Patel et al., 2008; Glass, Parashar, &amp; Estes, 2009). It is estimated that noroviruses cause 23 million episodes of illness, 65,000 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths each year in the United States (Bresee et al, 2012; Hall et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2008; Glass, Parashar, &amp; Estes, 2009; Glass et al., 1996; Parashar et al., 1998; Pang &amp; Vesikari, 1999; Mead et al., 1999; Echeverria et al., 1983), with most fatalities occurring in elderly patients. Although norovirus typically causes disease epidemics (Glass et al., 1996; Pang &amp; Vesikari, 1999; Echeverria et al., 1983), it is also a common cause of endemic diarrhea in community settings (Widdowson et al., 2004). Approximately 5 to 36 percent of outpatient visits for diarrhea are due to norovirus with similar percentages for patients hospitalized for gastroenteritis (Patel et al., 2008; Glass, Parashar, &amp; Estes, 2009). </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong><br />
The developer evaluated the reliability of risk-adjusted rates using a signal-to-noise ratio metric. The unit of analysis is the county. The noise measure is defined as the within-county variance, which is computed using a formula for the approximation for the variance of adjusted rates that is based on the observed and expected rates (see empirical methods document for details, or, for example Hosmer and Lemeshow [1995]). The signal measure is defined as the variance between counties. Signal-to-noise is computed for each county as [signal / (signal + noise)]. The overall signal-to-noise ratio is the weighted average of the county-specific signal-to-noise ratios where the weights are defined as [1/(signal + noise)^2]). The signal-to-noise ratio across deciles of county population size was evaluated. The overall reliability of the risk adjusted measure is high. More than 80% of counties had signal-to-noise ratios that exceeded a threshold reliability of 0.80. Reliability was lower in counties with smaller populations. The observed signal-to-noise ratios were below 0.80 in counties with populations less than about 2,300 persons. This finding implies that when rates are smoothed, the rates for counties with smaller populations will be shifted more toward the overall (national) population rate.</p>
<p>Overall, the risk-adjusted rate is strongly reliable. Based on a norm of a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.80, 80% of areas exceed the norm. Reliability is less than the norm in areas with population less than approximately 2,300 persons, meaning that the performance score is reliability adjusted closer to the shrinkage target in those areas.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong><br />
The developer examined the complexity of the numerator cases from 2008 to 2012 using three metrics: 1) the percent of discharges with comorbidities can increase the risk of dehydration, 2) the mean number of comorbidities as defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Comorbidity Index and 3) the mean age in years. The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether as rates of dehydration hospitalizations have decreased over time, the complexity of the remaining numerator cases has increased over time. Each of the three complexity metrics was calculated for each county in the State Inpatient Databases (SID); the distribution of the metrics across all counties is provided in Table 5 of the original measure documentation.</p>
<p>From 2008 to 2012, there was less than 10% change in the percent of cases with all comorbidities known to have higher risk for dehydration except renal failure which demonstrated a 10% decrease. However, the mean number of comorbidities across counties increased by 11%. The number of numerator observations with a behavioral health comorbidity increased by 22% but the total number remained low (mean of 0.21 in 2008 compared to 0.25 in 2012). Mean age remained unchanged. From this, we conclude that there is only modest evidence of increasing complexity in the numerator population during the period of decrease, suggesting that the decrease does not simply reflect the shifting of non-complex patients from hospital care to other settings.</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: The term MA was adopted by the United States (U.S.) Census in 1990 and referred collectively to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSAs), and primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs). In addition, "area" could refer to either 1) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) county, 2) modified FIPS county, 3) 1999 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Metropolitan Statistical Area, or 4) 2003 OMB Metropolitan Statistical Area. Micropolitan Statistical Areas are not used in the Quality Indicator (QI) software.</p>

Description of Allowance for Patient or Population Factors
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The predicted value for each case is computed using a hierarchical model (logistic regression with area random effect) and covariates for gender and age (in 5-year age groups). Because they cannot individually observe the age and gender of each person in a counties population, the developer uses the age and gender distribution of the county to estimate the number of "cases" in each age gender group. The reference population used in the regression is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Data (SID) for the year 2010 (combined), a database consisting of 46 states and approximately 38 million adult discharges, and the United States (U.S.) Census data by county. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., area). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population rate.</p>
