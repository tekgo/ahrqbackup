<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions and Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The following recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (<strong>Level A</strong>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In women with a uterine scar and a placenta previa at 16 or more weeks' gestation, an evaluation for placenta accreta is strongly recommended. If a formal radiologic evaluation cannot be done, a provider experienced in ultrasound should evaluate for placenta accreta. Ultrasound is recommended as a first step in evaluating for placenta accreta. If the diagnosis is uncertain, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered. </li>
    <li>Bleeding is likely to be greater with medical abortion than with surgical abortion, although the rates of hemorrhage remain low. Counseling regarding surgical and medical methods can address this increased risk of bleeding. </li>
</ol>
<p>The following recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (<strong>Level B</strong>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Obtaining a preoperative hemoglobin or hematocrit in all women undergoing second-trimester abortion and anemic women undergoing first-trimester medical abortion. </li>
    <li>In training settings, the routine use of intraoperative ultrasound may decrease the risk of incomplete abortion with first-trimester surgical abortion and may decrease the risk of perforation with standard dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E). </li>
    <li>Including vasopressin in a paracervical block may decrease blood loss from abortion. </li>
    <li>Balloon tamponade can be an effective intervention for controlling brisk hemorrhage or hemorrhage refractory to massage and uterotonics and should be considered early in the process of bleeding and hemorrhage. </li>
    <li>Uterine artery embolization (UAE) can effectively control hemorrhage caused by many etiologies. Where available in a timely manner, UAE should be considered before hysterectomy for management of postabortion hemorrhage in patients whose perfusion can be maintained during UAE. </li>
    <li>Uterotonic medications can help control hemorrhage from atony. For actively bleeding patients, methylergonovine maleate, misoprostol and vasopressin are appropriate first-line treatments, with methylergonovine maleate and vasopressin effecting the most rapid response. </li>
    <li>Limited evidence exists for the prophylactic use of methylergonovine maleate prior to first-trimester abortion in reducing the need for re-aspiration. </li>
</ol>
<p>The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus or expert opinion (<strong>Level C</strong>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Fetal demise with fetus retained for 4 or more weeks may be associated with an increased risk of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Obtaining a preoperative coagulation parameter can be considered on an individualized basis, though this has not been studied. </li>
    <li>For women at high risk of hemorrhage, referral to a hospital service or high-acuity center may decrease morbidity. </li>
    <li>Oxytocin can be used as a uterotonic after second-trimester abortion. </li>
</ol>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The MEDLINE database was used to identify references published between 1955 and December 2011. The database was searched for the following terms: abortion, hemorrhage, abortion complications, bleeding. Abstracts of all languages were included. The abstracts were reviewed and relevant articles obtained. Citations from these journals were reviewed, as well as contemporary textbooks. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched in English for publications regarding abortion and contraception. In addition, reference lists of identified manuscripts were searched for any additional studies that might be relevant. The guideline authors also searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Appropriate management of postabortion hemorrhage</p>
<p><strong>Groups Most Likely to Benefit</strong></p>
<p>Prior cesarean sections place women at higher risk of overall complications from second-trimester abortion, with one study demonstrating odds of complications seven times as great among women with two or more cesarean sections as among those with none. The three most common complications included hemorrhage, atony and cervical laceration. Obesity may be a risk factor for increased blood loss with dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E), though no well-designed studies have addressed this question. Women with bleeding disorders secondary to either anticoagulation therapy or bleeding diatheses should be identified through a detailed history. Although limited evidence suggests that significant bleeding with first-trimester abortion among anticoagulated patients is not common, it may theoretically be more common during second-trimester abortion. See Figure 1 in the original guideline for an algorithm for classifying women as being at low, moderate or high risk for hemorrhage after abortion.</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>False-positive and false-negative results of imaging </li>
    <li>Intensive interventions such as uterine artery embolization (UAE), laparoscopy, laparotomy and hysterectomy may be necessary in the event that primary and secondary treatment measures are unsuccessful in controlling bleeding. In one series, two complications of UAE were noted: one contrast reaction treated with diphenhydramine and one femoral embolus requiring emergent embolectomy. Because UAE is associated with less morbidity and mortality than laparotomy and hysterectomy, the guideline authors recommend attempting UAE prior to more invasive measures in settings where UAE is available. </li>
