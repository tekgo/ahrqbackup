Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology suggests the phrases, "<strong>strongly recommend</strong>" for strong evidence and "<strong>suggest</strong>" or "<strong>conditionally recommend</strong>" for weaker evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>Are car engineering advancements effective at preventing motor vehicle collision (MVC)-related injuries among the elderly?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline committee <strong>suggests</strong> that ongoing engineering advancements in car safety restraint systems begin to take into account passenger-specific factors such as age, weight, and height.</p>
<p>As the United States (US) population proportionally ages, the number of elderly drivers can be expected to increase. The literature has demonstrated that elderly drivers are at significant risk of injury when involved in an MVC as a driver, passenger, or pedestrian. The current safety restraint standards for vehicles in the US do not take into account the vulnerability to injury of elderly vehicle occupants. In low-speed collisions, the very restraint systems designed to prevent injury may be contributing to chest/torso injuries in the elderly. An ideal solution would entail the development and implementation of sex-, height-, and weight-sensitive restraints to protect elderly occupants.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Are environmental or behavioral interventions effective at preventing MVC-related injuries among the elderly?</p>
<p>To answer this question, the committee found two subsets of data, one subset addressing reminder signs for seat belt use (2a) and the other subset addressing traffic-calming measures (2b).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2A</strong></p>
<p>The guideline committee <strong>recommends</strong> that seat belt reminder signs are placed at exit points in areas with significant numbers of senior drivers, such as senior centers or assisted living facilities.</p>
<p>Elderly drivers are more likely to be injured by similar velocity crashes. Based on prospective interventional data collected in multicentered trials, seniors successfully responded to seat belt reminders, and the effects were sustained with time.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2B</strong></p>
<p>The guideline committee <strong>suggests</strong> that pedestrian crosswalks be marked with stop signs or traffic lights and that traffic-calming measures be considered in areas of high pedestrian density.</p>
<p>The elderly are at high risk of injury as pedestrians struck by cars. However, it seems that unmarked crosswalks, that is, ones without stop signs or traffic lights, are associated with increased injury risk. Pedestrians may consider a crosswalk to be safe simply because it is a crosswalk, without considering driver cues or behaviors. In addition, lowering speeds and adding speed bumps or traffic circles in higher-trafficked areas was associated with fewer fatal pedestrian crashes. These should be considered but may also have important implications for businesses and residents.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>Are risk screening strategies effective at preventing MVC-related injuries among the elderly?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline committee <strong>suggests</strong> that elderly should be screened for alcohol abuse, frailty, significant diabetes, hearing impairments, severe visual impairments, and coronary artery disease (CAD) if they are continuing to drive because these conditions are known to increase the risk of MVC-related injuries.</p>
<p>Behavioral interventions to prevent MVC-related injury have been shown to be effective for elderly drivers. These types of programs aim to change elderly driver behaviors to enhance their safety and reduce injury. Seat belt awareness programs can be successful in changing the habits of a generation that did not have mandatory seat belt laws. However, the research on other behavioral interventions is lacking. There is a need for additional direct intervention investigations. Risk reduction strategies strive to identify key risk factors that place elderly drivers at higher risk for MVCs and injury. Several medical conditions such as arrhythmias, CAD, diabetes, and hearing impairment have been implicated. Universal screening for alcohol and drug abuse or use causing driving impairment, irrespective of age, should be a goal. Finally, frailty has been increasingly found to be associated with injury outcomes; frailty assessment may be a useful tool to help identify at-risk aging drivers, and its predictive ability should be prospectively studied.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the elderly driver population is heterogeneous; thus, any generalized limitation on driving privileges based on medical conditions is not indicated; individual patients should be screened for significant impairments that might affect their ability to drive safely.</p>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Inclusion Criteria for This Review</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Study Types</strong></p>
<p>Studies included randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies, case-control studies, and meta-analyses. Case reports and reviews containing no original data or analyses were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Participant Types</strong></p>
<p>The guideline committee included all studies of motor vehicle&ndash;related injury prevention for participants age 65 years or older.</p>
<p><strong>Intervention Types</strong></p>
<p>The guideline committee included all studies of motor vehicle&ndash;related injury prevention methods. Because of the heterogeneity of the interventions, they were grouped into the main themes of engineering advancements, environmental and behavioral modifications, as well as risk screening.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measure Types</strong></p>
<p>The guideline committee limited the review to studies in which injury was the outcome, not simply collisions or incidents. Because of the heterogeneity of injury reports, all injuries were felt to be critical to evaluating the literature within the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>References were identified by research librarians using the Cochrane Library, and the MEDLINE database in the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health was searched using Entrez PubMed (<a href="http://www.pubmed.gov" title="PubMed Web site" target="_blank">www.pubmed.gov</a>) in November 2012. The search was designed to identify all English language citations regarding motor vehicle&ndash;related injury prevention in the elderly. In addition to the electronic search, the guideline committee manually searched the bibliographies of recent reviews and articles. Finally, the committee performed focus search updates in November 2013 and November 2014, during the review and manuscript preparation stages. Figure 1 in the original guideline document contains the medical subject headings (MeSH) terms used for the initial search.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>After completing a comprehensive literature search, three independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts, excluding reviews, case reports, articles in which injury was not the outcome measure, and unrelated articles. The resulting studies were used for the review. The study selection process is highlighted in the PRISMA flow diagram for Figure 2 in the original guideline document.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad Hoc Section for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment </li>
    <li>The paucity of controlled studies in the area of motor vehicle-related injury prevention among the elderly demonstrates a significant information gap, and this committee recommends further research to strengthen future evidence-based guidelines. Of note, the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) questions for this guideline deliberately focused on prevention programs that had been tested; other strategies, such as graduated driving laws for seniors, have been posited but not rigorously examined. Future topical updates will require reevaluation of these and other potentially useful injury prevention strategies. </li>
