<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Based upon data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Fistula First/Catheter Last initiative, a gradual trend towards lower catheter use has been observed among prevalent maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients in the U.S., declining from approximately 28% in 2006 to approximately 18% by August 2015. Furthermore, the percentage of maintenance HD patients using a catheter for at least three months has declined as well over this time period from nearly 12% to 10.8%. Continued monitoring of chronic catheter use is needed to sustain this trend.</p>
<p>This measure is intended to be jointly reported with the Hemodialysis Vascular Access: Standardized Fistula Rate (see the related NQMC summary, <a href="/summaries/summary/51318" title="Measure Summary #11396" target="_blank">End stage renal disease [ESRD]: adjusted percentage of adult hemodialysis patient-months using an autogenous arteriovenous fistula [AVF] as the sole means of vascular access</a>). These two vascular access quality measures, when used together, consider AVF use as a positive outcome and prolonged use of a tunneled catheter as a negative outcome. With the growing recognition that some patients have exhausted options for an AVF, or have comorbidities that may limit the success of AVF creation, joint reporting of the measures accounts for all three vascular access options. The fistula measure adjusts for patient factors where fistula placement may be either more difficult or not appropriate and acknowledges that in certain circumstances an AV graft may be the best access option. This paired incentive structure that relies on both measures reflects consensus best practice, and supports maintenance of the gains in vascular access success achieved via the Fistula First/Catheter Last Project over the last decade.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2014&ndash;December 2014 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility-level annual performance scores. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between-facility variation (&sigma;_b^2) and the within-facility variation (&sigma;_(t,w)^2) in the measure is determined. The inter-unit reliability (IUR) measures the proportion of the total variation of a measure (i.e., &sigma;_b^2+&sigma;_(t,w)^2) that is attributable to the between-facility variation, the true signal reflecting the differences across facilities. The developer assessed reliability by calculating IUR for the annual performance scores. If the measure were a simple average across individuals in the facility, the usual ANOVA approach would be used. The yearly based measure, however, is not a simple average and the developer&nbsp;instead estimate the IUR using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. A small IUR (near 0) reveals that most of the variation of the measures between facilities is driven by random noise, indicating the measure would not be a good characterization of the differences among facilities, whereas a large IUR (near 1) indicates that most of the variation between facilities is due to the real difference between facilities.</p>
<p>The reliability calculation only included facilities with at least 11 patients during the entire year.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The IUR is 0.765, which indicates that 76.5% of the variation in the annual long-term catheter rate can be attributed to between-facility differences in performance (signal) and about 23.5% to the within-facility variation (noise).</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The result of IUR testing suggests a high degree of reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Validity was assessed using Poisson regression models to measure the association between facility level quintiles of performance scores and the 2014 standardized mortality ratio (SMR, NQF 0369) and 2014 standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR, NQF 1463). Facility-level performance scores were divided into quintiles (Q1 to Q5), and the relative risk (RR) of mortality (and hospitalization, separately) was calculated for each quintile, using the combined Q1 and Q2 as the reference group. Thus, a RR greater than 1.0 would indicate a higher RR of mortality or hospitalization, compared to the lowest performance score quintiles.</p>
<p>In 2015, a vascular access technical expert panel (TEP) was convened to provide input on the development of access measures, and specifically input on exclusions for both catheter and fistula measures, and for fistula, risk adjustment factors to be considered. The TEP felt that minimizing catheter use is paramount and that while catheters may potentially be acceptable for some patients, they addressed this through identifying patient level exclusion criteria rather than risk adjustment. The candidate catheter measure was reviewed and validated by the TEP in 2015.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Quintiles of the performance scores were defined as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Q1*: 0.0% - less than 6.24% </li>
    <li>Q2*: 6.24% - less than 9.12% </li>
    <li>Q3: 9.12% - less than 12.00% </li>
    <li>Q4: 12.00% - less than 16.21% </li>
    <li>Q5: 16.21% - less than 58.16% </li>
</ul>
<p>*Q1 and Q2 as reference</p>
<p>Results from the Poisson model indicated that the percent of patient-months with a long-term catheter was significantly associated with the risks of mortality and hospitalization.</p>
<p>For the 2014 SMR, the RR of mortality increased as the performance measure quintile increased from the reference group (combined Q1 and Q2). For quintile 3, RR=1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.05; p=0.006), quintile 4, RR=1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.05; p=0.008), and quintile 5, RR=1.09 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.12; p less than 0.001).</p>
<p>Similarly for the 2014 SHR, the RR of hospitalization increased as the performance measure quintile increased from the reference group (combined Q1 and Q2). For quintile 3, RR=1.08 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.08; p less than 0.001), quintile 4, RR=1.10 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.10; p less than 0.001), and quintile 5, RR=1.16 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.16; p less than 0.001).</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>Results of the Poisson regression suggest the predictive relationship of higher catheter use with higher mortality and hospitalization, as measured by the respective standardized mortality and hospitalization rates, compared to facilities with a lower proportion of patients with a long-term catheter.</p></div>
