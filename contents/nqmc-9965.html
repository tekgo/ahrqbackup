<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This patient safety measure addresses medication management to prevent the harms associated with certain medications in the elderly. It identifies high-risk medications that should be avoided in the elderly population. Certain medications are associated with increased risk of harms from drug side-effects and drug toxicity, and pose a concern for patient safety (McLeod et al., 1997; Murray, 2000; Roose &amp; Spatz, 1999). There is clinical consensus that these drugs pose increased risks in the elderly (Graal &amp; Wolffenbuttel, 1999; Zhan et al., 2001; Fick et al., 2003). </p>
<p>The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) used the 2012 American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Updated Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults as a clinical foundation for this measure. The development of the 2012 Updated Beers Criteria was based on an extensive literature review and discussion by a panel of experts in geriatric care and pharmacotherapy. The Updated Beers Criteria is intended as a tool that both identifies and describes drugs and drug-disease interactions that should generally be avoided in people 65 years of age and older, because these drugs pose unnecessary risk for older adults (AGS Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2012). </p>
<p>Appropriate use of prescription drugs in the elderly, including proper drug selection, has been identified as an important quality of care issue, and explicit criteria defining inappropriate drug use as an important tool in the evaluation of prescribing to populations (Fick et al., 2003; AGS Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2012). Studies link prescription drug use by the elderly with adverse drug events that contribute to hospitalization, increased length of hospital stay, increased duration of illness, nursing home placement and falls and fractures that are further associated with physical, functional and social decline in the elderly (Fu, Liu, &amp; Christensen, 2004; Bates, 1999). </p>
<p>Reducing prescriptions of high-risk drugs in the elderly also represents an opportunity to reduce the costs associated with the harm from medications (e.g., hospitalizations from drug toxicity) and to encourage clinicians to consider safer, alternative medications. Reducing unnecessary prescribing will also help to reduce cost, given that the elderly population represents one-third of all prescription drug expenditures in the United States (U.S.), but comprises only 13 percent of the population (Families USA, 2000).</p></div>

    <li>A prescription (written or dispensed) for a medication in Table ADAE-A (refer to Table ADAE-A in the original measure documentation for a list of high-risk medications) </li>

<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Calculating Days Supply</em>: Calculate the days supply during the measurement year for medication classes in Table ADAE-B. The intent is to sum the days supply for all medications (listed in the "Prescription" column) within a medication class (listed in the "Description" column). Sum the days supply and subtract any days supply that extends beyond December 31 of the measurement year. For prescription data, "days supply" begin on the prescription date. If the total days supply in a medication class is greater than or equal to 182 days, count as two high-risk medications. Assess each medication class separately. Medications dispensed or prescribed in the year prior the measurement year with a days supply that extend into the measurement year must be counted towards the total days supply. </li>
    <li><em>Calculating Average Daily Dose</em>: Calculate the average daily dose for medications in Table ADAE-C. Multiply the quantity of pills dispensed or prescribed by the dose of each pill and divide by days supply. If a patient has two prescriptions for the same medication that meet the average daily dose criteria, count as one high-risk medication. If a patient has two prescriptions for different medications that meet the average daily dose criteria, count as two high-risk medications.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>To calculate daily dose for elixirs and concentrates, multiply the volume dispensed or prescribed by dose and divide by days supply. </li>
