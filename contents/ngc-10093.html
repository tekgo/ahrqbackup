<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>A-E, L</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk-Based Versus Screening Approach</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Offer all women screening for colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS) at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation with culture taken from one swab first to the vagina and then to the rectum (through the anal sphincter). (<strong>II-1A</strong>) This includes women with planned Caesarean delivery because of their risk of labour or ruptured membranes earlier than the scheduled Caesarean delivery. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Because of the association of heavy colonization with early onset neonatal disease, provide intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS at the onset of labour or rupture of the membranes to:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Any woman positive for GBS by vaginal/rectal swab culture screening done at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
        <li>Any woman with an infant previously infected with GBS (<strong>II-3B</strong>) </li>
        <li>Any woman with documented GBS bacteriuria (regardless of level of colony-forming units) in the current pregnancy (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Manage all women who are &lt;37 weeks' gestation and in labour or with rupture of membranes with intravenous GBS antibiotic prophylaxis for a minimum of 48 hours, unless there has been a negative vaginal/rectal swab culture or rapid nucleic acid-based test within the previous 5 weeks. (<strong>II-3A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Treat all women with intrapartum fever and signs of chorioamnionitis with broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeting chorioamnionitis and including coverage for GBS, regardless of GBS status and gestational age. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical Aspects of the Screening Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>Request antibiotic susceptibility testing on GBS-positive urine and vaginal/rectal swab cultures in women who are thought to have a significant risk of anaphylaxis from penicillin. (<strong>II-1A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-Labour Rupture of Membranes</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>There is good evidence based on randomized control trial data that in women with pre-labour rupture of membranes at term who are colonized with GBS, rates of neonatal infection are reduced with induction of labour (<strong>I</strong>). There is no evidence to support safe neonatal outcomes with expectant management in this clinical situation.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li>If a woman with pre-labour rupture of membranes at &ge;37 weeks' gestation is positive for GBS by vaginal/rectal swab culture screening, has had GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy, or has had an infant previously affected by GBS disease, administer intravenous GBS antibiotic prophylaxis. Immediate obstetrical delivery (such as induction of labour) is indicated, as described in the Induction of Labour guideline published by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist of Canada (SOGC) in September 2013 (see the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the SOGC guideline <a href="/content.aspx?id=47555" title="Guideline #10091">Induction of Labour</a>). (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>At &ge;37 weeks' gestation, if GBS colonization status is unknown and the 35- to 37-week culture was not performed or the result is unavailable and the membranes have been ruptured for greater than 18 hours, administer intravenous GBS antibiotic prophylaxis. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>If a woman with pre-labour rupture of membranes at &lt;37 weeks' gestation has an unknown or positive GBS culture status, administer intravenous GBS prophylaxis for 48 hours, as well as other antibiotics if indicated, while awaiting spontaneous or obstetrically indicated labour. (<strong>II-3B</strong>) </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Published literature was retrieved through searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library from January 1980 to July 2012 using appropriate controlled vocabulary and key words (group B streptococcus, antibiotic therapy, infection, prevention). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to May 2013. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.</p></div>

<h3>
Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Economic analyses of risk-based and universal culture-based approaches have been conducted and showed that universal culture-based is equivalent in cost to risk-based approach if one considers the cost savings involved with reduction of morbidity and mortality. It has also been shown that a risk-based versus screening approach is essentially equivalent in cost and in the number of women receiving antibiotics prophylaxis. </li>
    <li>A study comparing the estimated direct costs (including screening test costs and hospital costs) and consequences of intrapartum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for early-onset group B streptococcus (GBS) disease (Xpert GBS test) with antenatal lower vagina culture screening demonstrated a higher detection rate of GBS colonization with PCR (16.7% versus 11.7%). The average total cost per delivery was US$1759 &plusmn; 1209 for antenatal screening in 2009 and $1754 &plusmn; 842 for intrapartum screening in 2010 (<em>P</em>=0.9). With improved techniques, therefore, in some institutions GBS screening may be replaced by intrapartum PCR assessment. </li>

</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Concern that the use of antibiotics for group B streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis may result in the selection of other organisms such as <em>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</em> is certainly an issue in theory; however, a study of trends in neonatal sepsis has been reassuring, with no increase in the rate of neonatal sepsis overall in the post-GBS prophylaxis era, but some increase in<em> E. coli</em> sepsis in preterm or low-birth-weight infants only. </li>
    <li>Antibiotic resistance </li>
    <li>The risk of allergic or anaphylactic reaction to penicillins is between 4 per 10 000 and 4 per 100 000. For first-generation cephalosporins, the risk of cross-reaction with penicillins is 0.5%; the risk with second- and third-generation cephalosporins appears to be even lower. </li>
    <li>Disadvantages of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening are the lack of antibiotic susceptibility data, potentially false-negative results related to rupture of membranes, and the fact that there is insufficient time for use of selective enrichment broth for at least 4 hours prior to PCR in the intrapartum setting. </li>
