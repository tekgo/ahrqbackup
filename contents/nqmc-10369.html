Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Compared to other patient safety indicators (PSI), the four year trend for this quality indicator (QI) was consistent, and it was one of the most frequent QI in a sample of Veteran's Administration data, with risk-adjusted rate of 4.29 per 1,000 eligible patients in Fiscal Year (FY) 2004 (Rosen et al., 2006). Similar findings have been reported by community hospitals in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, with a risk-adjusted rate of 2.83 per 1,000 eligible patients in 2008. About 16,533 of these events are estimated to have occurred in U.S. community hospitals in 2008. International data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show substantial variation across countries, with a maximum rate of 4.03 per 1,000 eligible patients from Canada (Dr&ouml;sler et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Cases from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample that were flagged by this PSI had 2.2% excess mortality, 1.3 days of excess hospitalization, and $8,300 in excess hospital charges, relative to carefully matched controls that were not flagged (Zhan &amp; Miller, 2003). This finding was confirmed in the Veterans Affairs hospital system, where cases that were flagged by this PSI had 3.2% excess mortality, 1.4 to 3.1 days of excess hospitalization, and $3,359 to $6,880 in excess hospital costs, relative to carefully matched controls that were not flagged (Rivard et al., 2008). In another study based on State Inpatient Databases from seven states that permit linkage of serial hospitalizations, this indicator was associated with relative risk ratios of 1.52 for inpatient death, 1.16 for readmission within three months, and 1.25 for readmission within one month (after adjusting for age, gender, payer, comorbidities, and specific surgical Diagnosis-Related Groups [DRGs], and All-Patient Refined [APR]-DRG severity levels) (Friedman et al., 2009).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Consists of approximately 30 million adult discharges and 4,000 hospitals ("Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [HCUP] State Inpatient Databases [SID]," 2008). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. The signal to noise ratio is the ratio of the between hospital variance (signal) to the within hospital variance (noise). The formula is signal/(signal + noise). The ratio itself is only a diagnostic for the degree of variance in the risk-adjusted rate systematically associated with the provider. Therefore, what matters is the magnitude of the variance in the "smoothed" rate (that is, the variance in the risk-adjusted rate after the application of the univariate shrinkage estimator based on the signal ratio). </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. What the data demonstrate is systematic variation in the provider level rate of 1.136 to 5.075 per 1,000 from the 5th to 95th percentile after a signal ratio of 0.818 is applied as the shrinkage estimator (that is, after accounting for variation due to random factors). </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. The first study (Kaafarani et al., 2011) examined the criterion validity, specifically the positive predictive value (PPV), of 12 selected Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) using clinical data abstracted from the Veterans Health Administration (VA) electronic medical record (EMR) as the gold standard. The second study (Utter et al., 2009) recruited hospitals for participation in the Validation Pilot Project through the AHRQ Quality Indicators (QI) technical support listserv and conducted web-based informational sessions to introduce the study and outline expectations of participants. Participation was voluntary and without compensation. We asked participants to commit to test the <em>Accidental Puncture or Laceration</em> indicator as well as four other PSIs included in Phase I of the Validation Pilot Project. The 47 participating hospitals from 29 states included a spectrum of different sizes, ownership types, and academic affiliations. </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Calculation of the PPV, which is defined as the percentage of reported events that are confirmed as true events based upon application of a "criterion (gold) standard." Sensitivity is defined as the percentage of all eligible events (based upon the same criterion standard) that are reported by hospitals in the administrative data set used for validation. In the cited studies, the criterion standard was based on review of randomly sampled medical records by a trained nurse abstractor, using a standard data collection tool and guidelines, with secondary review of clinical details by an academic surgeon. Confidence intervals (CI) (95%) were estimated with adjustment for clustering of observations within hospitals, as appropriate. </p>
<p>A structured review of each indicator was undertaken to evaluate the face validity (from a clinical perspective) of the indicators. Specifically, the panels approach sought to establish consensual validity, which "extends face validity from one expert to a panel of experts who examine and rate the appropriateness of each item..." The methodology for the structured review was adapted from the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and consisted of an initial independent assessment of each indicator by clinician panelists using an initial questionnaire, a conference call among all panelists, followed by a final independent assessment by clinician panelists using the same questionnaire. The panel process served to refine definitions of some indicators, add new measures, and dismiss indicators with major concerns from further consideration.</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. The two studies estimated a nominal PPV&mdash;i.e., considering even minor complications that did not require repair as true events&mdash;of 85% (95% CI, 77% to 91%) and 91% (95% CI, 88% to 94%), respectively. The VA study (Kaafarani et al., 2011) assessed the interrater reliability between chart abstractors and reported an estimate of 97%. However, if such minor complications were classified as false positive cases, the estimated PPV of the indicator in the two studies decreased to 79% and 68%, respectively. A large proportion of all flagged cases (76%) in the second study involved some form of repair of the unintentionally damaged structure. A smaller percentage (4%) required a separate return to the operating room because the injury was not recognized during the initial procedure. Although precise proportions were difficult to estimate, many of the true-positive cases may not have been preventable because scar tissue or adhesions were associated with 25% to 40% of cases and because the goals of the operation in some cases (e.g., tumor-free margin of excision of a malignant lesion or emergency control of hemorrhage) may have warranted an increased risk of unintentional damage to other structures. </p>
<p>False positive rates were low in both of these studies. Some false positives were due to complications that were actually present on admission (i.e., 6 of 17 false positives in the VA study, 5 of 23 false positives in the AHRQ study), which would automatically be excluded by users with "present on admission" (POA) data. Adjusting for the availability of POA data, estimated PPVs are 90% from the VA and 93% from the AHRQ study. The remaining false positives were either non-accidental injuries (e.g., deliberate disruption of tissue to achieve surgical goals) or injuries unrelated to a puncture or laceration (e.g., bleeding, dislodgement of a tube or device).</p>

The reference population used in the regression is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Data (SID) for the years 2008, a database consisting of 42 states and approximately 30 million adult discharges. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., hospital).
