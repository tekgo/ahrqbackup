<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Diagnostic Tests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study where a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data was collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Prognostic Articles</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data was collected retrospectively.

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline panel sought to answer the following questions regarding the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use in acute ischemic stroke:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Are diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (compared to concurrent imaging with other techniques, established by follow-up imaging, clinical follow-up, and final discharge diagnosis)? </li>
    <li>Does the volume of the DWI or PWI abnormality predict initial clinical severity, final infarct size, and late clinical outcome? </li>
</ol>
<p>The panel performed a literature search through January 2008 in the following databases: Medline (starting 1966), EMBASE (starting 1974), Biosis (starting 1969), and Sci (starting 1990). The exact keyword search is available in appendix e-1 of the Data Supplement document (see "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The panel identified 492 abstracts for question 1 (DWI), 213 for question 1 (PWI), and 210 for question 2. Two panel members reviewed each abstract. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) unrelated to acute ischemic stroke &lt;12 hours (question 1) or &lt;24 hours (question 2) after symptom onset or unrelated to questions; 2) unrelated to DWI or PWI (i.e., computed tomography [CT], T2-weighted imaging, Xe-CT, positron emission tomography [PET], single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]); 3) case report or case series with n &lt;15; 4) review article; 5) letter to the editor or editorial; 6) involving pediatric patients or nonhuman subjects; or 7) nonclinical (e.g., technique development). The eligible publications of each pair were discussed with the whole panel to produce a final list of articles for each question.</p>
<p>The panel chose a time window of 12 hours for question 1 because most treatment studies for acute stroke have an inclusion window of &lt;12 hours. DWI and PWI have a high diagnostic accuracy within the first hours, and effective treatment of acute stroke is negatively correlated with time from symptom onset.</p>
<p>Studies that included patients in a time window exceeding 12 hours were considered for inclusion if a subset of patients &lt;12 hours was reported or the numbers for such a subset could be extracted. For question 2, the panel chose a time window of 24 hours and a sample size of 30 or more for inclusion. Furthermore, they excluded studies in which any patients received thrombolytic therapy so as not to confound the prognostic value of DWI and PWI with regard to the natural disease course.</p>
<p>Recently reported large open series, phase II and III randomized, placebo-controlled trials of MRI-guided IV thrombolysis in acute stroke (DIAS, DEDAS, DIAS-2, EPITHET) are a case in point. These trials selected patients for inclusion up to 9 hours from stroke onset on the basis of a qualitative MRI penumbral pattern. For this assessment, only the placebo groups of these trials would be eligible and helpful in judging diagnostic accuracy (question 1) or predictive value for baseline clinical status and clinical or structural outcome (question 2). No separate imaging data are available for any of these studies yet; in EPITHET, only summary data and the subgroups with PWI/DWI mismatch are presented.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>Medline was searched between 2010 July 13 and 2013 July 13. The following search terms were used: T2weighted or T2(w)weighted) or (FLUID(w)ATTENUATED(w)INVERSION(w)RECOVERY or FLAIR) (Stroke or attack or cerebrovascular accident or apoplexia or apoplexy or CVA or cerebrovascular(w)accident) and (Brain ischemia! or ((brain or cerebr?) and (ischemi?

<p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) unrelated to acute ischemic stroke &lt;12 hours (question 1) or &lt;24 hours (question 2) after symptom onset or unrelated to questions; 2) unrelated to DWI or PWI (i.e., CT, T2‐weighted imaging, Xe‐CT, PET, SPECT); 3) case report or case series with n &lt;15; 4) review article; 5) letter to the editor or editorial; 6) involving pediatric patients or nonhuman subjects; or 7) nonclinical (e.g., technique development).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>Medline was searched from July 2013 to July 2016 using the same search terms used for the 2013 Reaffirmation. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) unrelated to acute ischemic stroke &lt;12 hours (question 1) or &lt;24 hours (question 2) after symptom onset or unrelated to questions; 2) unrelated to DWI or PWI (i.e., CT, T2‐weighted imaging, Xe-CT, PET, SPECT); 3) case report or case series with n &lt;15; 4) review article; 5) letter to the editor or editorial; 6) involving pediatric patients or nonhuman subjects; or 7) nonclinical (e.g., technique development).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was classified using a 4-tier classification scheme for diagnostic (question 1) and prognostic (question 2) articles (see "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence") and recommendations were based on these levels of evidence (see "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations"). If more than one publication from identical groups entered data extraction, the manuscripts were assessed for the same patients being used in different analyses. In this case, the publication with the highest class of evidence and patient number was included. After the selection process, panel members discussed potentially relevant publications that could change the level of recommendation. These studies were included or excluded by consensus.</p></div>

<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) member who had expertise in stroke conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The true sensitivity of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is not 100% and is probably closer to 80% to 90% in a general sample of patients presenting for emergency evaluation of possible stroke. Increasingly, however, cases of DWI-negative stroke were reported. False-negative DWI in ischemic stroke may be attributable to mild (small) strokes, brainstem location, and the earliest times from onset, and may become less frequent as imaging technology continues to improve.</p></div>

Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least three AAN committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology&reg; peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.aan.com" title="AAN Web site">www.aan.com</a>.</p>
