<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of recommendation (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak/conditional</strong>) is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Population, Intervention, Comparators, Outcome (PICO) 1</strong></span></p>
<p>Should bone mineral-enhancing agents be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors <strong>conditionally recommend</strong> vitamin D and calcium supplementation for frail elderly individuals. </p>
<p>Although the data vary widely in study population and dosing strategy, it is safe to say that most studies favor a higher dose of vitamin D. Usual daily dosing ranging from 400 IU to 800 IU cholecalciferol, while another regimen involves 100,000 IU cholecalciferol every 4 months. Calcium dosing ranges from 1,000 to 1,500 mg/day. This has been shown to improve muscle strength and balance. Sex and racial homogeneity predominated in most of the studies, which may decrease generalizability. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PICO 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Should hip protectors be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors <strong>conditionally recommend </strong>hip protectors for frail elderly individuals in the appropriate environment. </p>
<p>It is a known fact that hip fractures cause substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality among the elderly. Evidence shows a modest decrease in hip fractures when worn properly. The major issue with hip protectors is compliance, especially with unattractive hip widening that accompanies usage of protective padding. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PICO 3</strong></span></p>
<p>Should exercise programs be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors <strong>conditionally recommend</strong> evidence-based exercise programs for frail elderly individuals. </p>
<p>The data vary in modesty regarding use of exercise programs in decreasing fall-related injuries, mostly due to small sample sizes. Nevertheless, most of the results depict reduction of injuries related to falls, when used in the appropriate setting. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PICO 4</strong></span></p>
<p>Should physical environment modifications be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors <strong>conditionally recommend</strong> physical environment modification for frail elderly people.</p>
<p>Owing to difficulty in making appropriate changes to the environmental factors that truly affect fall-related injuries, the data render mixed results in this arena, although grab bars, clutter removal, etc. seem to be of benefit. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PICO 5</strong></span></p>
<p>Should risk factor screening be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors <strong>conditionally recommend</strong> frailty screening for the elderly.</p>
<p>Although risk factor screening is not a direct intervention, it may be used as a mechanism of which higher-risk individuals can be targeted for appropriate risk-reduction interventions. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PICO 6</strong></span></p>
<p>Should multiple interventions tailored to the population or individuals be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors <strong>strongly recommend</strong> risk stratification with targeted, comprehensive risk-reduction strategies tailored to particular high-risk groups.</p>
<p>Although mixed strategies seem to assist in decreasing fall-related injuries among the elderly, the results are hampered by heterogeneity such as differing medication dosages, variable sample sizes, and participant adherence. The largest favorable studies have been conducted in health care systems with universal access and a central payer. In alternative health care systems (or fee-for-service-systems), cost-effectiveness of these comprehensive strategies would have to be assessed.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Inclusion Criteria for this Guideline </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Study Types </strong></p>
<p>Studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective observational studies, case-control studies, and meta-analyses. Case reports and reviews containing no original data or analyses were excluded. No date range was specified so as not to exclude early, salient studies. </p>
<p><strong>Participant Types </strong></p>
<p>The authors included all studies of falls-related injury prevention for participants aged 65 and older. </p>
<p><strong>Intervention Types </strong></p>
<p>The authors included all studies of falls-related injury prevention methods related to their Population, Intervention, Comparators, Outcome (PICO) questions of interest. For PICO 6, they included studies of multiple simultaneous interventions, such as vitamin D plus strength training, tailored to the individual or to a population. </p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measure Types </strong></p>
<p>The authors limited the review to studies in which injury was the outcome, not simply falls. Owing to the heterogeneity of injury reports, all injuries including, but not limited to, fractures, contusions, lacerations, and hemorrhage were felt to be essential to evaluating the literature within the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Data Sources and Search </strong></span></p>
<p>References were identified by research librarians using the Cochrane Library, the MEDLINE database in the National Library of Medicine, and the National Institutes of Health via Entrez PubMed (<a href="http://www.pubmed.gov" title="PubMed Web site" target="_blank">www.pubmed.gov</a>) in November 2012 with a simple search in March 2015. The search was designed to identify English-language citations regarding fall-related injury prevention in the elderly. The search strategy was defined a priori to evaluate only those articles in which injury was the outcome, not falls alone. Supplemental digital content 1 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) contains the MESH terms used for the initial search. The articles were limited to humans, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), practice guidelines, meta-analyses, and reviews. A total of 1,830 studies were initially identified.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Study Selection</strong></span></p>
<p>Case reports and small case series were excluded (n=128). The authors then reviewed the articles for relevance and excluded articles that did not include injury as a specific outcome of interest (n=1478). Articles not relevant to the authors' specific PICO interventions (n=195) were also excluded. Additional articles were added to the literature summary after reading relevant review articles and meta-analyses (n=20). The final list of 49 articles was reviewed and used to create the recommendations. Each author separately reviewed the evidence to support recommendations using the GRADE methodology in December 2012. Finally, they performed a focused search update in March 2015, during the review and manuscript preparation stages. One additional article was identified and included in the analysis at that time, for a final total of 50 articles reviewed. The study selection process is highlighted in the PRISMA flow diagram for Figure 1 (see the original guideline document).</p></div>

<p>All studies used for the review were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing information on authors, article title, study methodology, and intervention and outcome measures. A master copy was provided to all reviewers. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Methodological Quality Assessment</strong></span></p>
<p>The authors used the validated Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for this study. Each designated reviewer independently evaluated the data in aggregate with respect to the quality of the evidence to adequately answer each Population, Intervention, Comparators, Outcome (PICO) question and quantified the strength of any recommendations. Reviewers are asked to determine effect size, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, precision, and publication bias. </p>
<p>Recommendations are based on the overall quality of the evidence. The GRADE methodology suggests the phrases, "we strongly recommend" for strong evidence, and "we conditionally recommend" for weaker evidence.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The authors used the validated Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for this study. The GRADE methodology entails creating a predetermined question or set of questions that the literature must answer, in the patient population, intervention, comparators, outcome (PICO) format. The PICO questions were created using a modified Delphi method by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma Injury Control and Violence Prevention Committee along with the Practice Management Guideline Section. </p>
<p>For this guideline, six topical PICO questions were estimated by the authors as the most salient aspects of injury-related falls prevention. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PICO Questions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Population</strong>: Age 65 and older </p>
<p><strong>Intervention</strong>: Clinical interventions to reduce fall-related injuries </p>
<p><strong>Comparators</strong>: Intervention compared with control group </p>
<p><strong>Outcome</strong>: Injury due to falls </p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 1</strong>: Should bone mineral-enhancing agents be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 2</strong>: Should hip protectors be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 3</strong>: Should exercise programs be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 4</strong>: Should physical environment modifications be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 5</strong>: Should risk factor screening be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 6</strong>: Should multiple interventions tailored to the population or individual be used to prevent fall-related injuries in the elderly? </p>
<p>After completing a comprehensive literature search performed by a university-affiliated research librarian, three independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts, excluding reviews, case reports, articles in which injury was not an outcome measure, and unrelated articles. The resulting studies were used for the guideline.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Bone mineral density can be improved with vitamin D and calcium supplementation; vitamin D in particular may also improve muscle strength and balance. </li>
    <li>Hip protectors seem to be modestly effective at secondary prevention of fall-related fractures. </li>
    <li>Exercise may decrease the likelihood of falling in the first place, and then, by improving general health and perhaps bone density, decrease the likelihood of having injury. </li>
    <li>Risk factor screening, while not directly an intervention, may be able to help identify higher-risk individuals for targeted strategies. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Of note, for institution-dwelling elderly, several investigators have examined the effects of restraint use for individuals with dementia. While this is not exactly an environmental modification, it is worth noting that restraints do not seem to improve safety and may in fact be associated with more injuries. </li>
    <li>A key issue with hip protectors is compliance, which is generally poor for these devices, and the negligible treatment effect for community-dwelling elderly suggests that the number needed to treat would be excessive for that population. </li>
