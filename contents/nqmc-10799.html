<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is intended to promote unhealthy alcohol use screening and brief counseling which have been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption. About 30% of the United States (U.S.) population misuse alcohol, with most engaging in what is considered risky drinking (Saitz, 2005). A recent analysis of data from the National Alcohol Survey shows that approximately one-third of at-risk drinkers (32.4%) and persons with a current alcohol use disorder (31.5%) in the U.S. had at least&nbsp;one primary care visit during the prior year, demonstrating the potential reach of screening and brief counseling for unhealthy alcohol use in the primary care setting (Mulia et al., 2011). A number of studies, including patient and provider surveys, have documented low rates of alcohol misuse screening and counseling in primary care settings. In the National Healthcare for Communities Survey, only 8.7% of problem drinkers reported having been asked and counseled about their alcohol use in the last 12 months (D'Amico et al., 2005). A nationally representative sample of 648 primary care physicians were surveyed to determine how such physicians identify - or fail to identify - substance abuse in their patients, what efforts they make to help these patients and what are the barriers to effective diagnosis and treatment. Of physicians who conducted annual health histories, less than half ask about the quantity and frequency of alcohol use (45.3 percent). Only 31.8 percent say they ever administer standard alcohol or drug use screening instruments to patients (The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, 2000).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines</strong>:</p>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2013) recommends that clinicians screen adults aged 18 years or older for alcohol misuse and provide persons engaged in risky or hazardous drinking with brief behavioral counseling interventions to reduce alcohol misuse.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a testing project in 2012 to ensure the <em>Unhealthy Alcohol Use: Screening &amp; Brief Counseling </em>measure is reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure denominator, numerator and exceptions case identification. The testing projects were conducted utilizing electronic health record data. Three sites participated in the parallel forms reliability testing of the measure. Site A was comprised of a network of community health centers across the United States serving more than 2.5 million patients annually. Site B was a large independent multi-specialty group the Midwest comprised of over 315 physicians. Site C was a single physician owned adult primary care private practice in Chicago.
<p><strong>Measures Tested </strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Unhealthy Alcohol Use: Screening &amp; Brief Counseling </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from electronic health records were used to calculate parallel forms reliability for the measure.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing Results</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parallel Forms Reliability Testing </span></p>
<p>Site A, Site B, and Site C</p>
<p>There were 120 observations from Site A, Site B and Site C used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.31 demonstrates fair agreement between the automated report and manual reviewer. </p>
<p>The kappa statistic value of 0.31 demonstrates fair agreement. This is due to the high observed agreement rate and the concentration of observations in the YES, YES cell (81% of all observations [97/120]). This is an example of the limitation of the Kappa statistic. While agreement can be high, if one classification category dominates, kappa can be significantly reduced (Warrens, 2010; Feinstein &amp; Cicchetti, 1990). </p>
<p>Of the 120 observations that were initially selected, 97 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.82 demonstrates almost perfect agreement between the automated report and reviewer. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval) </span></p>
<p>Denominator: 120, 85.0%, 0.31 (0.10&ndash;0.52) <br />
Numerator: 97, 91%, 0.82 (0.70&ndash;0.93)</p>
