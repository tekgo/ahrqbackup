Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of home health episodes of care during which the patient's toileting hygiene improved or stayed the same as at admission.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patients need certain physical abilities and capacities (motor skills, symptom relief) to manage toilet hygiene. Many patients who receive home health care may have chronic illnesses or disabilities that lead to difficulty performing the tasks of self-grooming, and/or may need help from another person or special equipment to accomplish this activity. Good toileting hygiene can reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and other infections related to inadequate hygiene. Maintaining toileting hygiene reduces the risk of preventable health-care associated infections. High-quality home health care will reinforce toileting hygiene and protect patients against the development of a urinary tract infection (UTI) during care. Stabilization in in toileting hygiene is a rehabilitation goal for some patients and can be an indicator of effective high-value care.</p>
<p>A report on agency performance on this measure is provided to home health agencies (HHAs) as part of the Outcome-Based Quality Improvement (OBQI) Outcome Report. The OBQI reports allow the agency to compare their agency's rates in the current year compared to prior years and to national reference rates (i.e., benchmarking) values. HHAs can use the OBQI outcome measures as part of a systematic approach to continuously improving the quality of care they provide by targeting care practices that influence specific patient functioning and health status. Therefore, the measure is important to making significant gains in health care quality and improving health outcomes for a specific high impact aspect of healthcare where there is variation in performance.</p>
<p>Analysis of measure scores demonstrates that 1) there is room for improvement with respect to this quality measure; and 2) considerable variability exists in the performance of agencies on the risk-adjusted measure, suggesting that it captures an aspect of care that is under the agency's control.</p></div>
