Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients in the clinic panel who are planning a pregnancy who receive counseling and education before pregnancy according to the guideline.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of pregnant patients or women planning pregnancy who receive timely prenatal counseling and education as outlined in the guideline.</p>
<p>There is near-universal agreement that prenatal care is both beneficial and cost effective. Care designed to help bring healthy babies into the world is regarded as the highest of aspirations. Yet when examined critically, not all prenatal care can be shown to demonstrably improve maternal or neonatal health.</p>
<p>In 1989, the Expert Panel on the Content of Prenatal Care established guidelines on the timing and content of prenatal care, including a schedule consisting of fewer prenatal visits than traditional models provided. This reduced schedule of visits applied to women considered at low risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Timing and focusing prenatal visits at these intervals, along with providing designated education pieces at each visit, should serve to provide a more comprehensive and satisfying prenatal program than has existed in the past. </p>
<p>Prenatal education is the primary tool used to transmit information to women about their pregnancies. Prenatal education serves to help reduce modifiable risk factors and to add to women's satisfaction by increasing their knowledge about pregnancy changes, fetal development, etc. Women who did not receive complete prenatal health behavior advice were 1.5 times more likely to deliver very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. Adequately trained health care staff can reinforce the counseling women have received in prenatal education sessions at each prenatal visit.</p></div>
