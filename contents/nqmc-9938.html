Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adults 18 to 64 years of age with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis who were not dispensed an antibiotic medication. </p>
<p class="Note">This measure is reported as an inverted rate [1 - (numerator/eligible population)]. A higher rate indicates appropriate treatment of adults with acute bronchitis (i.e., the proportion that were <em>not</em> treated with antibiotics).</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Electronic and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Electronic specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid specification. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Antibiotics are most often inappropriately prescribed for adults with acute bronchitis (Gonzales et al., "Excessive," 2001). Antibiotics are not indicated in clinical guidelines for treating adults with acute bronchitis who do not have a comorbidity or other infection for which antibiotics may be appropriate (Gonzales et al., "Acute," 2001; Gonzales et al., "Nonspecific," 2001). Inappropriate antibiotic treatment of adults with acute bronchitis is of clinical concern, especially since misuse and overuse of antibiotics lead to antibiotic drug resistance (Steinman et al., 2004). Acute bronchitis consistently ranks among the 10 conditions that account for the most ambulatory office visits to United States (U.S.) physicians; furthermore, while the vast majority of acute bronchitis cases (more than 90 percent) have a nonbacterial cause, antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed 65 to 80 percent of the time (Gonzales et al., "Excessive," 2001; McCaig, Besser, &amp; Hughes, 2003).</p></div>
