<p>The overall strength of the evidence is based on the certainty of the magnitude of benefit defined as benefit minus harm. </p>
<p><strong>Quality of the Evidence*</strong></p>
<p><strong>High</strong>. The available evidence includes consistent results from well designed, well conducted studies in representative populations. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>. The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as: the number, size, or quality of individual studies; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice; lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong>. The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of: limited number or size of studies; important flaws in study design or methods; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; gaps in the chain of evidence; findings not generalizable; lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendation*</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. The committee strongly recommends that clinicians routinely provide this therapy. There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>. The committee recommends that clinicians routinely provide this therapy. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>. The committee recommends that clinicians consider providing this therapy to selected patients depending on individual circumstances. However, for most individuals without signs or symptoms there is likely to be only a small benefit from this service.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>. The committee recommends against the therapy. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should discourage the use of this service.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>. The committee concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A multidisciplinary committee composed of 17 members reviewed the 2007 guidelines and developed a series of questions related to chronic drug therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF). An evidence review was commissioned from The Johns Hopkins University, with systematic reviews completed for each question. New reviews were conducted for each question, as some questions were new or revised, new medications and indications were considered, and because a full systematic review was not completed for all questions in the development of the 2007 guidelines. The review was limited to parallel and cross-over randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</p>
<p>In January 2011, the evidence review team completed searches of PubMed, Excerpta Medica (EMBASE) database, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). They combined controlled vocabulary terms and text words for cystic fibrosis and each therapy being reviewed to create comprehensive search strategies. Reviews and animal studies were excluded; however, no date or language restrictions were applied during the search. The evidence review team also conducted manual searching of reference lists of included or eligible articles and relevant review articles, and asked the members of the guideline committee to review the included and excluded studies.</p>
<p>The original search was completed in January 2011. An additional review question on ivacaftor was added in December 2011 and the databases were searched for ivacaftor-related articles in December 2011.</p></div>

Number of Source Documents
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The search identified a total of 6,898 unique citations, of which 57 were included in the 2007 guidelines (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). The current guidelines are based on review of 137 articles describing 84 studies (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). Because some questions addressed in the current guidelines differ from those posed in the 2007 guidelines, 14 studies reviewed previously were not included in the current literature review.</p></div>

<p>The overall strength of the evidence is based on the certainty of the magnitude of benefit defined as benefit minus harm.</p>
<p><strong>Quality of the Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High</strong>. The available evidence includes consistent results from well designed, well conducted studies in representative populations. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>. The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as: the number, size, or quality of individual studies; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice; lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong>. The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of: limited number or size of studies; important flaws in study design or methods; inconsistency of findings across individual studies; gaps in the chain of evidence; findings not generalizable; lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>. The committee strongly recommends that clinicians routinely provide this therapy. There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>. The committee recommends that clinicians routinely provide this therapy. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>. The committee recommends that clinicians consider providing this therapy to selected patients depending on individual circumstances. However, for most individuals without signs or symptoms there is likely to be only a small benefit from this service.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>. The committee recommends against the therapy. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should discourage the use of this service.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>. The committee concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is concern that the chronic use of azithromycin in individuals with occult or active nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection could lead to resistance, and thus complicate NTM treatment. For this reason, the committee suggests that patients should be screened for NTM before initiating azithromycin, and reassessed periodically at 6- to 12-month intervals. In addition, this monotherapy should be withheld in those infected with NTM. </li>
    <li>The most common side effects of inhaled hypertonic saline are cough and bronchospasm, which are well tolerated, particularly if subjects are pretreated by an inhaled bronchodilator. </li>
    <li>Voice alteration was noted as the most common side effect of dornase alfa, occurring in up to 18% of patients. </li>
    <li>Recommendations for chronic use of medications are based on relatively short trials. The committee recognizes that many intervention trials, even those ideally designed, have a finite duration. It is likely that patients will use medications for years or even decades, and that side effects (or benefits) might arise after very long-term use that were not anticipated based on shorter studies. Thus, clinicians must continue to monitor individuals for possible unanticipated side effects of these therapies. </li>
