<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>A-C</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The levonorgestrel intrauterine device (IUD) has been shown to be effective in treating abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and should be considered for all age groups. </li>
    <li>Medical treatment options for abnormal uterine bleeding associated with ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O) include progestin therapy and combined hormonal contraception. </li>
    <li>Women who have completed childbearing, in whom medical therapy has failed, or who have contraindications to medical therapy are candidates for hysterectomy without cervical preservation. </li>
    <li>Because AUB-O is an endocrinologic abnormality, the underlying disorder should be treated medically rather than surgically. Surgical therapy is rarely indicated for the treatment of AUB-O, unless medical therapy fails, is contraindicated, is not tolerated by the patient, or the patient has concomitant significant intracavitary lesions. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Failure of medical management requires further investigation, including imaging or hysteroscopy. </li>
    <li>The choice of treatment of AUB-O is guided by the goals of therapy, which may be to stop acute bleeding, avoid future irregular or heavy bleeding, simultaneously provide contraception, and prevent complications, such as anemia, unnecessary surgical intervention, and diminished quality of life. </li>
    <li>Endometrial ablation is not recommended as a first-line therapy for AUB-O. Physicians must provide thorough informed consent and adequate counseling to women with AUB-O who desire endometrial ablation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' own internal resources were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 1990 and January 2013. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician-gynecologists were used.</p></div>
