<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based</strong>, <strong>Formal consensus</strong>, <strong>Informal consensus</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Question 1</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Indications for Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Biopsy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: Thin melanomas: Routine SLN biopsy is not recommended for patients with melanomas that are T1a (nonulcerated lesions &lt;0.8 mm in Breslow thickness). SLN biopsy may be considered for T1b patients (0.8 to 1.0 mm Breslow thickness or &lt;0.8 mm Breslow thickness with ulceration) after a thorough discussion with the patient of the potential benefits and risk of harms associated with the procedure (Type of recommendation: evidence based; potential benefits outweigh risk of harms; Quality of evidence: low to intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: Intermediate-thickness melanomas: SLN biopsy is recommended for patients with melanomas that are T2 or T3 (Breslow thickness of &gt;1.0 to 4.0 mm; Type of recommendation: evidence based; potential benefits outweigh risks of harm; Quality of evidence: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: Thick melanomas: SLN biopsy may be recommended for patients with melanomas that are T4 (&gt;4.0 mm in Breslow thickness), after a thorough discussion with the patient of the potential benefits and risks of harm associated with the procedure (Type of recommendation: Evidence based; potential benefits outweigh risks of harm; Quality of evidence: low to intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Question 2</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Role of Completion Lymph Node Dissection (CLND)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: CLND or careful observation are options for patients with low-risk micrometastatic disease, with due consideration of clinicopathological factors. For higher risk patients, careful observation may be considered only after a thorough discussion with patients about the potential risks and benefits of forgoing CLND (Type of recommendation: evidence based; potential benefits outweigh risks of harm; Quality of evidence: intermediate to high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review based on the following criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 1</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients with primary cutaneous melanoma without clinical evidence of lymph node involvement </li>
    <li>Subgroups of interest: Patients with melanoma of varying Breslow thickness, including thin (&le;1.0 mm), intermediate (&gt;1.0 to 4.0 mm), and thick (&gt;4.0 mm) </li>
    <li>Intervention: Wide excision and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy </li>
    <li>Comparison: Wide excision and nodal observation </li>
    <li>Outcomes: Melanoma-specific survival, disease-free survival, recurrence, variation in rate of SLN positivity according to established risk factors (e.g., ulceration, mitotic rate), morbidity </li>
    <li>Eligible study designs: Systematic reviews, randomized and nonrandomized studies </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical Question 2</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients with newly diagnosed primary cutaneous melanoma </li>
    <li>Intervention: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) after a positive SLN biopsy </li>
    <li>Comparison: Observation (no CLND) after a positive SLN biopsy </li>
    <li>Outcomes: Survival (melanoma-specific, disease-free), regional disease control, operative morbidity </li>
    <li>Eligible study designs: For the previous version of this guideline, the Expert Panel stated that the results of phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were awaited and would inform the recommendation related to CLND after positive SLN biopsy; therefore, the standard for clinical question 2 was limited to phase III RCTs. </li>
</ul>
<p>PubMed was searched from September 2011 to June 16, 2017. Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative reviews; (3) published in a non-English language. In addition, because sentinel node status has already been established as a prognostic indicator and has been incorporated into the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, studies reporting outcomes related to the prognostic significance of a positive sentinel node were excluded. Test performance characteristics of SLN biopsy, e.g., false negative rates, were considered to have already been established; therefore, studies reporting only these outcomes were also excluded from this guideline update. To avoid duplication, data were not extracted from studies that were included in eligible systematic reviews or meta-analyses.</p></div>

<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by two American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewers in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by two staff reviewers and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the manuscript.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study quality was formally assessed for the studies identified. Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer and included factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, etc. The risk of bias is assessed as "low," "intermediate," or "high" for most of the identified evidence.</p></div>

<p>The Expert Panel met via teleconference and/or webinar and corresponded through e-mail. Based upon the consideration of the evidence from a systematic review of the literature conducted by a trained methodologist, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize the guideline recommendations. The recommendations were developed by an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation, including expertise in medical oncology, surgical oncology, nuclear medicine, pathology, and plastic and reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>The guideline recommendations are crafted, in part, using the Guidelines Into Decision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software. In addition, a guideline implementability review is conducted. Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias are provided with each recommendation.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the methods used to develop this update is available in the Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), including an overview (e.g., panel composition, development process and revision dates; the recommendation development process [GLIDES and BRIDGE-Wiz]; and quality assessment).</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Knowledge of regional lymph node status helps to determine prognosis, facilitates strategies for regional disease control, and aids in the selection of patients who may benefit from adjuvant therapy. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that accurately detects nodal metastases in patients with clinically occult disease. </li>
    <li>SLN biopsy has been found to be useful for intermediate-thickness melanoma, based on results from a meta-analysis that showed low false-negative rates and high rates of sentinel node detection.</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy I (MSLT-I), the most common complications after sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy resolved over time and included seroma (5.5%), infection (4.6%) and wound separation (1.2%). A more recent meta-analysis reported an overall complication rate of 4.6%.</li>
    <li>Data from MSLT-I demonstrated a higher risk of lymphedema with completion lymph node dissection (CLND) when disease is detected clinically during follow-up; however, patients were not closely followed with nodal ultrasound in that study.</li>
    <li>Adverse events such as lymphedema were more common in the CLND group than in the observation group in MSLT-II (24.1% v 6.3%).</li>
    <li>In the German Dermatologic Oncology Cooperative Group (DeCOG-SLT) trial, adverse events occurred in 24% of 240 patients, including &ge;grade 3 adverse events in 14% of patients. Grade 3 and 4 events included lymphedema (n = 20), lymph fistula (n = 3), seroma (n = 3), infection (n = 3), and delayed wound healing (n = 5). </li>

The information herein should not be relied upon as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary.

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
<p>For additional information on the ASCO implementation strategy, please see the <a href="https://www.asco.org/node/5376/" title="ASCO Web site">ASCO Web site</a>.</p></div>
