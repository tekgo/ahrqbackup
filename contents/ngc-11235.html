<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team's project coordinator searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines and other relevant content published between May 2006 and December 2015. This list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice websites, recommendations from the literature, and key Web sites related to adult asthma care. Furthermore, expert panel members were asked to provide guidelines from their own personal libraries. Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of Web sites searched and inclusion criteria, is available at the <a href="http://rnao.ca/" title="RNAO Web site">RNAO Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search strategy was developed by RNAO's research team and a health sciences librarian, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. A search for relevant articles in English published between May 2006 and December 2015 was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC [research question 3 only]), EMBASE, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, and PsycINFO. In addition to this systematic search, panel members were asked to review personal libraries for key articles not found through the above search strategies.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms, is available in the guideline search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Once articles were retrieved, three RNAO Best Practice Guideline (BPG) nursing research associates (nurses holding master's degrees) independently assessed the eligibility of the studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The RNAO's BPG program manager involved in supporting the RNAO expert panel resolved disagreements.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hand Search</span></strong></p>
<p>Panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify key articles not found through the above search strategies. Articles identified by panel members were included in the search results if two nursing research associates independently determined the articles had not been identified by the literature search and met the inclusion criteria.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) research team critically appraised 12 international guidelines using the <em>Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II</em> (Brouwers et al., 2010). Four guidelines were removed based on their relatively low methodological quality. Members of the expert panel reviewed the remaining eight guidelines and associated quality appraisal scores. From this review, six guidelines were selected to inform the recommendations and discussions of evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Quality appraisal scores for 41 articles (a random sample of approximately 25 percent of articles eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by three RNAO Best Practice Guideline (BPG) research associates. Acceptable inter-rater agreement between all three research associates (kappa statistic, K=0.97, 0.87 and 0.89) justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction by dividing the remaining studies equally between the three research associates. A final summary of literature findings was completed. The comprehensive data tables and summary were provided to all expert panel members for review and discussion.</p>
<p>A complete bibliography of all full text articles screened for inclusion is available (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<p>For this revised guideline, Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas. A systematic review of the evidence was based on the purpose and scope of the original guideline, <em>Adult Asthma Care Guidelines for Nurses: Promoting Control of Asthma</em> (2004) and the revision supplement (2007), and was supported by the four clinical questions listed below. The systematic review captured relevant peer-reviewed literature and guidelines published between May 2006 and December 2015. The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What are the appropriate nursing assessment strategies to use with adults living with asthma to achieve optimal asthma control? </li>
    <li>What are the appropriate nursing management strategies to use with adults living with asthma to achieve optimal asthma control? </li>
    <li>What education and training do nurses require to assist persons living with asthma to achieve optimal asthma control? </li>
    <li>What organization or health-system level supports are needed to enable health-care providers to assist persons living with asthma to achieve optimal asthma control? </li>
</ol>
<p>The expert panel's mandate was to review the original guideline and the revision supplement in light of the new evidence to ensure the continuing validity, appropriateness, and safety of the recommendations. This new revised guideline is the result of the expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence into the recommendations with the supporting evidence from original guideline and the revision supplement (where applicable).</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Stakeholder reviewers are individuals who have expertise in the subject matter of the guideline, are representatives of organizations involved in implementing the guideline, or are affected by the implementation of the guideline. Reviewers may be nurses and other point-of-care health-care providers, nurse executives, administrators, research experts, members of interdisciplinary teams, educators, nursing students, or individuals who have personal experience with asthma. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) aims to solicit stakeholder expertise and perspectives representing a diversity of health-care sectors, roles within nursing and other professions (e.g., clinical practice, research, education, and policy), and geographic locations.</p>
<p>Stakeholder reviewers for the RNAO guidelines are identified in two ways. First, stakeholders are recruited through a public call issued on the RNAO Web site <a href="http://rnao.ca/bpg/get-involved/stakeholder" title="RNAO Web site">(http://rnao.ca/bpg/get-involved/stakeholder</a>). Second, individuals and organizations with expertise in the guideline topic area are identified by the RNAO guideline development team and expert panel and are directly invited to participate in the review.</p>
<p>Reviewers are asked to read a full draft of the guideline and participate in the review prior to its publication. Stakeholder feedback is submitted online by completing a survey questionnaire. The stakeholders are asked the following questions about each recommendation:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Is this recommendation clear? </li>
    <li>Do you agree with this recommendation? </li>
    <li>Is the discussion of evidence thorough and does the evidence support the recommendation? </li>
</ul>
<p>The survey also provides an opportunity for stakeholders to include comments and feedback for each section of the guideline.</p>
<p>Survey submissions are compiled and feedback is summarized by the RNAO Guideline development team. The RNAO development team and expert panel reviews and considers all feedback and, if necessary, modifies the guideline content and recommendations prior to publication to address the feedback received.</p></div>

Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Nurses, other health-care providers, and administrators who lead and facilitate practice changes will find this document invaluable for developing policies, procedures, protocols, educational programs and assessments, interventions, and documentation tools. Nurses and other health-care providers in direct care will benefit from reviewing the recommendations and the evidence that supports them. </li>
    <li>Nurses provide care for persons with asthma in a multitude of settings and are in a unique position to promote asthma control. Evidence-based asthma care can lead to optimal asthma control. Evidence-based care includes self-management education, creating documented asthma action plans in collaboration with persons with asthma, promoting appropriate medication use, and coordinating appropriate follow-up care. Optimizing asthma control can improve quality of life for the person with asthma and can reduce urgent/emergent related health-care visits and health-care costs. </li>
    <li>A strong quality Cochrane meta-analysis showed that provision of educational interventions either during or following emergency department visits decreased the risk of future hospital admissions, and improved scheduled appointment attendance and symptom control. </li>
    <li>Actively educating (i.e., one-on-one coaching) persons with asthma on correct inhaler device technique has been shown to lead to improved technique. </li>
    <li>A moderate quality observational study found that individuals who received primary care supplemented with a certified respiratory educator (CRE) were more likely to receive comprehensive asthma care that included asthma education and regular follow-up care. </li>

    <li>This nursing Best Practice Guideline (BPG) is a comprehensive document that provides resources for evidence-based nursing practice. It is not intended to be a manual or "how to" guide, but rather a tool to guide best practices and enhance decision-making for nurses and other health-care providers working with adults living with asthma. The Guideline should be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of individual organizations or practice settings, and the needs and preferences of persons and their families accessing the health system for care and services. In addition, the Guideline provides an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care. </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines for practice to change. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> (2nd ed.; 2012) provides an evidence-informed process for doing this (see Appendix Q in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>The Toolkit is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health care is more likely when:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation </li>
</ul>
<p>The Toolkit uses the "Knowledge-to-Action" framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.</p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of the Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The Nursing Best Practice Champion Network&reg;, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs </li>
    <li>Nursing Order Sets, which provide clear, concise, actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic medical records, but may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments </li>
    <li>The Best Practice Spotlight Organization&reg; (BPSO&reg;) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs&reg; focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific BPGs and their implementation annually. Information about RNAO implementation strategies can be found at: </p>
