<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The oxygenator arterial outlet blood temperature is recommended to be used as a surrogate for cerebral temperature measurement during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). (<strong>Class I, Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>To accurately monitor cerebral perfusate temperature during warming, it should be assumed that the oxygenator arterial outlet blood temperature underestimates cerebral perfusate temperature. (<strong>Class I, Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Pulmonary artery or nasopharyngeal (NP) temperature recording is reasonable for core temperature measurement. (<strong>Class IIa, Level C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoidance of Hyperthermia</span></strong></p>
<p>Surgical teams should limit arterial outlet blood temperature to less than 37&deg;C to avoid cerebral hyperthermia. (<strong>Class I, Level C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peak Cooling Temperature Gradient and Cooling Rate</span></strong></p>
<p>Temperature gradients between the arterial outlet and venous inflow on the oxygenator during CPB cooling should not exceed 10&deg;C to avoid generation of gaseous emboli. (<strong>Class I, Level C</strong>)</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Temperature gradients between the arterial outlet and venous inflow on the oxygenator during CPB rewarming should not exceed 10&deg;C to avoid outgassing when warm blood is returned to the patient. (<strong>Class I, Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Rewarming when arterial blood outlet temperature &ge;30&deg;C:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>To achieve the desired temperature for separation from bypass, it is reasonable to maintain a temperature gradient between the arterial outlet and the venous inflow temperature of 4&deg;C or less. (<strong>Class IIa, Level B</strong>) </li>
        <li>To achieve the desired temperature for separation from bypass, it is reasonable to maintain a rewarming rate of 0.5&deg;C/min or less. (<strong>Class IIa, Level B</strong>) </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Rewarming when arterial blood outlet temperature is lower than 30&deg;C: To achieve the desired temperature for separation from bypass, it is reasonable to maintain a maximal gradient of 10&deg;C between the arterial outlet and venous inflow temperature.

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers used a systematic search of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms to identify peer-reviewed articles related to temperature management in the setting of adult cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Candidate articles were published in PubMed between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2014. The search revealed 768 abstracts, all of which were reviewed in duplicate by independent reviewers, with 153 abstracts selected for full paper review. To be included, each paper had to report data on each of the following: (1) optimal site for temperature monitoring, (2) avoidance of hyperthermia, (3) peak cooling temperature gradient and cooling rate, and (4) peak warming temperature gradient and rewarming rate.</p>
<p>According to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) rules, any reviewer could select an abstract for inclusion in a paper review, but at least 2 reviewers had to agree to exclude a paper. At the paper review stage, at least 2 reviewers had to agree to exclude a paper. These rules were incorporated into Guideliner reviewing software.</p>
<p>MeSH terms used to identify peer-reviewed articles related to temperature management in the setting of adult cardiopulmonary bypass:</p>
<p>("cardiopulmonary bypass" [MeSH Terms] <em>or</em> perfusion [TIAB]) <em>and</em> ("body temperature" [MeSH Terms] <em>or</em> "body temperature regulation" [MeSH Terms] <em>or</em> "rewarming" [MeSH Terms]) <em>and</em> ("humans" [MeSH Terms] <em>and</em> English [lang] <em>and</em> "adult" [MeSH Terms])</p>

Number of Source Documents
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Two reviewers rejected 615 abstracts based on a lack of relevance, leaving 153 abstracts for full paper review. Two panel members reviewed each paper, and 82 of these papers were found not to contribute to the topic by both reviewers, a further 32 had conflicting reviews and were individually resolved, and the final 39 were considered for inclusion in the guideline.</p>
<p>Thirteen articles considered relevant to the topic by the authors were included to provide method, context, or additional supporting evidence for the recommendations.</p>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Avoidance of cerebral hyperthermia in the setting of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been promoted to avoid cerebral injury. </li>
    <li>Avoidance of adverse effects associated with hyperthermia. One study reported an association with hyperthermia and an increased rate of mediastinitis. Another study reported that an arterial outlet temperature exceeding 37&deg;C during CPB is an independent predictor of acute kidney injury. </li>
    <li>Outgassing may be prevented by maintaining a maximal 10&deg;C gradient between the arterial blood outlet and the venous inlet blood temperature. </li>
    <li>According to one author, slow rewarming increases the likelihood of preventing hyperthermia. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Slowest rewarming rate was associated with improved indices of cardiac function (improved cardiac index and decreased lactate production) but was disadvantaged by longer bypass times and time to reach core temperature targets. </li>
    <li>The data suggest that rapid rewarming to normothermia may lead to inadvertent cerebral hyperthermia. </li>
