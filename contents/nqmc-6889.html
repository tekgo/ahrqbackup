<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (or caregiver[s], as appropriate) who were queried about sleep disturbances at least annually.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Sleep disorders are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and most commonly include sleep fragmentation (80%), restless legs syndrome (20%), rapid eye movement (REM) behavior sleep disorder (&gt;40%), and excessive daytime sleepiness (~50%). Sleep fragmentation could relate to motor symptoms such as tremor and dystonia, restless legs syndrome, depression, anxiety, agitation, urinary frequency, or medication (most notably selegiline but also dopamine agonists). Several approaches to effective therapy are available. Excessive daytime sleepiness could result in sleep attacks or unintended sleep episodes. Such episodes have been described in various situations, including while driving a car. Excessive daytime sleepiness may result from medication (dopamine agonists), dementia, psychosis, or poor nocturnal sleep hygiene and is generally more common in advanced PD. Medication adjustment and the use of stimulants may be warranted. REM behavior disorder is defined by the patient acting out dreams. The result could be either the patient or spouse moving to a different bedroom. This syndrome is treated with benzodiazepines and other medications. Assessing sleep would be expected to lead to improved morbidity and function.*</p>
<p class="Note">*The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:</p>
<p class="Note">A full sleep history should be taken from people with PD who report sleep disturbance. (Level D) (NICE GL35, Jun 2006)</p>
<p class="Note">Good sleep hygiene should be advised in people with PD with any sleep disturbance and includes: avoidance of stimulants (for example, coffee tea, caffeine) in the evening; establishment of a regular pattern of sleep; comfortable bedding and temperature; provision of assistive devices, such as a bed lever or rails to aid with moving and turning, allowing the person to get more comfortable; restriction of daytime siestas; advice about taking regular and appropriate exercise to induce better sleep; a review of all medication and avoidance of any drugs that may affect sleep or alertness, or may interact with other medication (for example, selegiline, antihistamines, H2 antagonists, antipsychotics and sedatives). (NICE GL35, Jun 2006)</p>
<p class="Note">All veterans with PD should be reassessed for complications of PD (including, but not limited to functional status, excessive daytime somnolence, speech and swallowing difficulties, dementia, depression, and psychosis) at least on an annual basis. (Cheng #10 [Reassessment for complications for PD], 2004)</p></div>
