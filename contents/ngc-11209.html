Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1: What Is the Incidence of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) in Different Epilepsy Populations?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Incidence Recommendation 1: SUDEP Incidence in Children</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians caring for children with epilepsy should inform the children's parents or guardians that (<strong>Level B</strong> for the following):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>There is a rare risk of SUDEP. </li>
    <li>In 1 year, SUDEP typically affects 1 in 4,500 children with epilepsy; in other words, annually, 4,499 of 4,500 children will not be affected by SUDEP. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Incidence Recommendation 2: SUDEP Incidence in Adults</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should inform adult persons with epilepsy that (<strong>Level B</strong> for the following):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>There is a small risk of SUDEP. </li>
    <li>In 1 year, SUDEP typically affects 1 in 1,000 adults with epilepsy; in other words, annually, 999 of 1,000 adults will not be affected by SUDEP. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2: Are There Any Risk Factors for SUDEP?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong></p>
<p>For persons with epilepsy who continue to experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), clinicians should continue to actively manage epilepsy therapies to reduce seizure occurrences and the risk of SUDEP while incorporating patient preferences and weighing the risks and benefits of any new approach (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong></p>
<p>For persons with frequent GTCS and nocturnal seizures, clinicians may advise selected patients and families, if permitted by their individualized epilepsy and psychosocial circumstances, to use nocturnal supervision or other nocturnal precautions, such as the use of a remote listening device, to reduce SUDEP risk (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should inform patients with epilepsy that seizure freedom, particularly freedom from GTCS (which is more likely to occur with medication adherence), is strongly associated with a decreased risk of SUDEP (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Additional Conclusions (No Recommendations Made)</strong></p>
<p>The evidence is low that the following factors are associated with altering SUDEP risk:</p>
<ol start="1" typ="1">
    <li>Nocturnal seizures (associated with increased risk) </li>
    <li>Any specific antiepileptic drug (AED) (none associated specifically with increased risk) </li>
    <li>Lamotrigine use in women (associated with increased risk) </li>
    <li>Never having been treated with an AED (associated with increased risk) </li>
    <li>Number of AEDs used overall (associated with increased risk) </li>
    <li>Heart rate variability (not associated with increased risk) </li>
    <li>Extratemporal epilepsy (associated with increased risk) </li>
    <li>Intellectual disability (associated with increased risk) </li>
    <li>Male sex (associated with increased risk) </li>
    <li>Anxiolytic drug use (associated with increased risk) </li>
</ol>
<p>The evidence is very low or conflicting that the following factors are associated with altering SUDEP risk:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Overall seizure frequency when evaluated by using all seizure types </li>
    <li>Medically refractory epilepsy vs not having well-controlled seizures defined as no seizures in the last year </li>
    <li>Monotherapy vs polytherapy </li>
    <li>Carbamazepine, phenytoin, or sodium valproate levels that are above, below, or within the reference range </li>
    <li>Psychotropic drug use </li>
    <li>Mental health disorders, lung disorders, or alcohol use </li>
    <li>Lamotrigine use in people with highly refractory epilepsy </li>
    <li>Frequent changes in AEDs </li>
    <li>Therapeutic drug monitoring </li>
    <li>Undergoing a resective epilepsy surgical procedure (although current research does not rule out the possibility of a beneficial effect or, further, the potential effect of epilepsy surgery on reducing GTCS frequency and epilepsy severity on reducing SUDEP risk) </li>
    <li>Engel outcome of epilepsy surgery (although current research does not rule out the possibility of a beneficial effect and, further, the potential effect of epilepsy surgery on reducing GTCS frequency and epilepsy severity on reducing SUDEP risk) </li>
    <li>Vagus nerve stimulator use for more than 2 years (however, current research does not rule out the possibility of a beneficial effect and, further, the potential effect of epilepsy surgery on reducing GTCS frequency and epilepsy severity on reducing the risk of SUDEP) </li>
    <li>Epilepsy etiology, whether idiopathic or localization-related </li>
    <li>Structural lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </li>
    <li>Duration of epilepsy </li>
    <li>Age at epilepsy onset </li>
    <li>Postictal electroencephalogram (EEG) suppression </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Rules for Classification of Evidence for Risk of Bias</strong></p>
<p><em>Screening Scheme</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class I</span></p>
<p>A statistical, population-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. All patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class II</span></p>
<p>A statistical, non-referral-clinic-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. Most patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class III</span></p>
<p>A sample of patients studied during the course of the condition. Some patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation by someone other than the treating physician.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class IV</span></p>
<p>Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><em>Prognostic Accuracy Scheme</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class I</span></p>
<p>A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class II</span></p>
<p>A case-control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared with a broad spectrum of controls, or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data were collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class III</span></p>
<p>A case-control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data were collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who did not determine the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of a prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class IV</span></p>
<p>Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><em>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</em></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. <em>Must</em> recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>should</em>. <em>Should</em> recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>may</em> or <em>might</em>. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that "must" be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that "should" be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that "might" be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate. </p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A Level R designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention </li>
</ul></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 2010, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee (GDDI) and the Guidelines Committee of the American Epilepsy Society convened a panel of experts to develop this practice guideline. In November 2010, an independent librarian performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE in all languages from earliest available article to November 2010. The guideline panel performed an identical search in April 2015 to include articles published since November 2010. The following keywords were used in both the 2010 and the 2015 searches: SUDEP OR (sudden AND (unexplained OR unexpected) AND death). These were combined with the traditional medical subheadings (MeSH) for epilepsy ("Epilepsy/abnormalities" OR "Epilepsy/classification" OR "Epilepsy/complications" OR "Epilepsy/drug effects" OR "Epilepsy/drug therapy" OR "Epilepsy/epidemiology" OR "Epilepsy/ethnology" OR "Epilepsy/etiology" OR "Epilepsy/genetics" OR "Epilepsy/mortality" OR "Epilepsy/physiopathology" OR "Epilepsy/prevention and control" OR "Epilepsy/therapy") with limits of "Humans," plus "All Child: 0&ndash;18 years" or "All Adult: 19+ years." Literature types were limited to "Clinical Trial, Randomized Controlled Trial, Comparative Study, Controlled Clinical Trial, Evaluation Studies, Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Research Support, N I H, Extramural, Research Support, N I H, Intramural, Research Support, Non U S Gov't, Research Support, U S Gov't, Non P H S, Research Support, U S Gov't, P H S, Validation Studies." Finally, the guideline panel specifically searched causes implicated in SUDEP (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias and preictal autonomic dysfunction) where the hypotheses were tested. See appendix e-4 in the online Data Supplement for the complete search strategy.</p>
<p>Two panel members working independently of each other reviewed each of the resulting 1,068 abstracts to establish whether any of the corresponding articles met the inclusion criteria (data relevant to questions, cohort, case control, case series, n &gt;10). A total of 744 abstracts were excluded at this point because the corresponding articles did not include data that addressed either question, such as not addressing actual SUDEP occurrences but evaluating possible SUDEP risk factors. A total of 324 abstracts met criteria for full-text review, and their corresponding articles were reviewed. Of those, 70 articles met criteria for classification and each was classified by at least 2 GDDI committee panel members reviewing independently of each other. Reviewed articles were entered into a database application through an online questionnaire. Thirty-five articles had data for inclusion. The remaining articles were excluded because they did not have data that addressed the question or otherwise did not meet inclusion criteria, did not employ an adequate sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) definition, or did not use an appropriate epilepsy comparison group in the prognostic studies.</p>
<p>Included articles were required to state that the sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) definition provided by Nashef 1997, Annegers 1997, and Leestma et al. 1997 was used or to describe criteria in accordance with these definitions. These definitions share the following criteria: (1) Patients had epilepsy by reasonable criteria. (2) Deaths by drowning, trauma, or status epilepticus were excluded. (3) Death could have occurred after a witnessed seizure. (4) Other competing causes of death were excluded.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The guideline panel used 2 of the American Academy of Neurology's (AAN's) evidence-based schemes to rate articles: the screening criteria for the incidence question and the prognostic criteria for the risk factor question (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Strong evidence for incidence criteria was supported by a population-representative cohort of people with epilepsy evaluated by either prospective or retrospective methods (retrospective accepted because of the objective nature of the outcome assessed), more than 80% completeness of evaluation of deaths within that cohort, and more than 80% evaluation of those deaths for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) as a cause. In these articles, the total number of patient-years of follow-up must have been provided or readily derived in order to calculate the denominator for SUDEP rates. Strong evidence for SUDEP risk factors came from studies that prospectively followed a cohort of patients with epilepsy and compared the frequency with which factors were present in cases of SUDEP vs in living persons with epilepsy. Retrospective case-control studies provided the majority of the data regarding SUDEP risk factors (Class II evidence). Because of the variability in the completeness of data in SUDEP research, SUDEP cases are categorized as definite, probable, and possible. Definite SUDEP cases meet the criteria stated previously and have a postmortem report. Probable SUDEP cases meet all the criteria stated previously but lack postmortem data. Possible SUDEP cases are those for which SUDEP cannot be ruled out but there is insufficient evidence regarding the circumstances of death, potential competing causes of death (such as presence of cardiac risk factors), and lack of an available postmortem report. Only definite and probable cases were included in this analysis.</p>
<p>The available literature consisted of multiple Class I articles for incidence, and therefore articles rated Class II or lower for incidence were excluded. Several Class I and many more Class II articles were available for prognostic questions. For the 2 included articles published before the accepted SUDEP definition from 1997 was established, the definition was still applied.</p>
<p>Strength of the evidence to determine final conclusions was derived according to a modified Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process. This modified GRADE process requires that the guideline panel reach agreement on whether to downgrade the evidence because of a lack of precision, consistency, generalizability, or biological plausibility, or to upgrade the evidence because of a clear dose response or a large magnitude of effect. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for incidence studies of similar populations in order to derive summary measures when confidence intervals (CIs) for these studies were dissimilar.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The recommendations were first anchored in the strength of the conclusions and then further modulated by application of a modified Delphi process. Through this process, the recommendation levels could be dissociated to some degree from the evidence strength. For example, recommendations could be downgraded on the basis of drawbacks such as cost, patient preference, or availability of the intervention, or upgraded because of a low degree of risk in relation to benefit. Many conclusions were of sufficient strength to support counseling recommendations. Although the therapeutic classification scheme was not used because the literature search did not find any treatment trials, therapeutic recommendations were derived from risk factors that could be modified by medical intervention. The level of the therapeutic recommendation was anchored in the strength of the conclusion regarding the associated prognostic risk factor and was subject to downgrading or upgrading as just described.</p></div>

Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. <em>Must</em> recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>should</em>. <em>Should</em> recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>may</em> or <em>might</em>. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that "must" be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that "should" be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that "might" be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes. </p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R </strong>designation is appropriate. </p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A Level R designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention </li>
</ul></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It seems reasonable to infer that improved control of an individual's generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) will result in a reduced risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Thus, a reduction in SUDEP risk is an additional benefit to the many benefits resulting from improved seizure control. </li>
    <li>People with epilepsy and their families prefer to be informed of the individual's risk for a catastrophic event such as SUDEP, even when the probability of the event is low. After being informed of an adverse event, people commonly overestimate the risk of that adverse event happening to them. Such overestimation unduly increases anxiety related to an adverse event. Overestimation can be lessened by presenting the risk as the probability of both having and not having the event, and by using numbers in addition to words and frequencies rather than percentages to convey the risk. </li>
    <li>The presence in the bedroom of another individual at least 10 years of age and of normal intelligence is associated with a decreased SUDEP risk. If it were in accordance with patient and family circumstances and values, nocturnal supervision could reduce SUDEP risk. </li>
    <li>Patients are especially interested in factors that might reduce their risk even when a causal link between the factor and a reduction in risk has not been established. Knowledge of these risk factors might suggest behaviors that could modify the risk factors (e.g., improved therapy adherence), increase the person's sense of control, and reduce the anxiety that comes from awareness of the risk. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>As with all benefits associated with improved seizure control, the potential benefit of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk reduction needs to be balanced with the risks and burdens associated with antiseizure therapies. </li>
    <li>If it were in accordance with patient and family circumstances and values, nocturnal supervision could SUDEP risk; however, providing nighttime observation might be overly burdensome and intrusive. </li>
