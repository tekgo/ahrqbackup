<div class="content_para"><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendations (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Closed or open reduction of subaxial cervical fractures or dislocations is recommended. Decompression of the spinal cord/restoration of the spinal canal is the goal. </li>
    <li>Stable immobilization by either internal fixation or external immobilization to allow for early patient mobilization and rehabilitation is recommended. If surgical treatment is considered, either anterior or posterior fixation and fusion is acceptable in patients not requiring a particular surgical approach for decompression of the spinal cord. </li>
    <li>Treatment of subaxial cervical fractures and dislocations with prolonged bed rest in traction is recommended if more contemporary treatment options are not available. </li>
    <li>The routine use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of trauma victims with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is recommended, even after minor trauma. </li>
    <li>For patients with AS who require surgical stabilization, posterior long-segment instrumentation and fusion or a combined dorsal and anterior procedure is recommended. Anterior standalone instrumentation and fusion procedures are associated with a failure rate of up to 50% in these patients. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>Subaxial cervical spine fractures and dislocations encompass a broad spectrum of acute traumatic injuries. Adequate decompression of the neural elements and the restoration of sufficient spinal stability to allow early mobilization and rehabilitation remain basic treatment tenets. Although nonsurgical treatment can be employed successfully, surgical treatment of these injuries achieves these goals more consistently and more quickly, especially in higher grades of injury. Both anterior and posterior surgical approaches have been reported as effective. Neither approach is necessarily superior to the other as long as the goals of treatment can be accomplished. Treatment must be individualized on the basis of the specific characteristics of each particular injury. Factors to be considered include neurologic status, the degree and type of bony and/or ligamentous disruption, and the degree and cause of spinal cord compression. The treatment of patients with AS who sustain traumatic subaxial cervical spinal fractures is challenging and has a comparatively high associated morbidity and mortality, regardless of the treatment offered or the surgical approach used.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search was performed in a fashion similar to the one that formed the basis of the previous guideline on this topic. The search consisted of publications from1966 through 2011 using the following headings limited to the English language: "cervical vertebrae," "spinal fractures," and "dislocations," leading to 8684, 5810, and 9450 citations, respectively. The first heading was combined with the second 2 headings, leading to a subset of 1,118 and 466 citations, respectively. Another search of "therapeutics" or "treatment" limited to the English language led to 1,870,663 citations. This was combined with each of the 2 prior subsets, leading to 856 citations with abstracts. These abstracts were reviewed, and only those containing 10 or more cases of subaxial cervical injury after nonpenetrating cervical trauma were included.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
