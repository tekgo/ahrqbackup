<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Type 1 and 2: Screening and Referral for Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)</span> </strong></p>
<p><strong>DM: Screening for Type 2 Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>The registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), in collaboration with other members of the health care team, should ensure that all overweight or obese adults at risk are screened for type 2 diabetes. Testing to assess risk for future diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more or 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more in Asian Americans) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>DM: Referral for MNT</strong></p>
<p>The RDN, in collaboration with other members of the health care team, should ensure that all adults with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are referred for MNT. Individuals who have diabetes should receive individualized MNT to achieve treatment goals, preferably provided by a RDN familiar with the components of diabetes MNT.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DM Type 1 and 2: MNT</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>DM: Initial Series of MNT Encounters</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should implement three to six MNT encounters during the first six months, and determine if additional MNT encounters are needed. In studies reporting on the implementation of an initial series of RDN encounters (three to 11; total of two to 16 hours), MNT significantly lowered glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.3% to 2.0% in adults with type 2 diabetes and by 1.0% to 1.9% in adults with type 1 diabetes during the first six months, as well as optimization of medication therapy and improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>DM: MNT Follow-Up Encounters</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should implement a minimum of one annual MNT follow-up encounter. Studies longer than six months report that continued MNT encounters resulted in maintenance and continued reductions of A1C for up to two years in adults with type 2 diabetes, and for up to 6.5 years in adults with type 1 diabetes.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DM Type 1 and 2: Nutrition Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nutrition Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should assess the following in adults with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, to formulate the nutrition care plan:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Biochemical data, medical tests and medication usage</em>: Type of diabetes; glycemic control (target glucose and A1C levels are noted in the annual American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes); lipid profiles; blood pressure; stage of chronic kidney disease; use of glucose- and lipid-lowering medications, anti-hypertensive medications, prescription and other over-the-counter medications, herbal supplements and complementary or alternative medications </li>
    <li><em>Nutrition-focused physical findings</em>: Height, weight, BMI and waist circumference; injection sites; relative importance of weight management </li>
    <li><em>Client history</em>: General health and demographic information; social history; cultural preferences; health literacy and numeracy; education and occupation; knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, motivation, readiness to change, self-efficacy and willingness and ability to make behavioral changes; physical activity; patient or family nutrition-related medical and health history; other medical or surgical treatments; previous nutrition care services and MNT recommendations </li>
    <li><em>Food and nutrition-related history</em>: Food, beverage and nutrient intake including energy intake, serving sizes, meal-snack patterns, carbohydrate, fiber, types and amounts of fat, protein, micronutrient intake and alcohol intake; experience with food, previous and current food and nutrition history, eating environment, access to healthy foods and eating out </li>
</ul>
<p>Assessment of the patient's psychological and social situation should be included as an ongoing part of the medical management of diabetes, which may include, but are not limited to, attitudes about the illness, expectations for medical management and outcomes, affect and mood, general and diabetes-related quality of life, resources (financial, social and emotional), and psychiatric history, as well as addressing common co-morbid conditions that may complicate diabetes management.</p>

<p><strong>DM: Individualize Nutrition Prescription</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should individualize the nutrition prescription and implement evidence-based guidelines in collaboration with the adult with diabetes. A variety of eating patterns (combinations of different foods or food groups) are acceptable for the management of diabetes. Personal preferences (e.g., tradition, culture, religion, health beliefs and goals, economics) and metabolic goals should be considered when recommending one eating pattern over another. Treatment decisions should be founded on evidence-based guidelines tailored to individual patient preferences, prognoses and co-morbidities.</p>

<p><strong>DM: Encourage Healthful Eating Plan for Appropriate-Weight Adults with Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>For appropriate-weight adults with diabetes, the RDN should encourage consumption of a healthful eating plan, with a goal of weight maintenance and prevention of weight gain. A variety of eating patterns (combinations of different foods or food groups) are acceptable for the management of diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>DM: Encourage Reduced Energy Healthful Eating Plan for Overweight or Obese Adults with Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>For overweight or obese adults with diabetes, the RDN should encourage a reduced energy, healthful eating plan, with a goal of weight loss, weight loss maintenance and prevention of weight gain. Studies based on reduced energy interventions reported significant reductions in HbA1c of 0.3% to 2.0% in adults with type 2 diabetes and of 1.0% to 1.9% in adults with type 1 diabetes, as well as optimization of medication therapy and improved quality of life.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DM Type 1 and 2: Macronutrient Composition</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>DM: Individualize Macronutrient Composition</strong></p>
<p>The RDN, in collaboration with the adult with diabetes, should individualize the macronutrient composition of the healthful eating plan within the appropriate energy intake. Limited research regarding differing amounts of carbohydrate (39% to 57% of energy) and fat (27% to 40% of energy), reported no significant effects on A1C or insulin levels in adults with diabetes, independent of weight loss. Limited research reports mixed results regarding the effects of the amount of protein (ranging from 0.8 g to 2.0 g per kg per day) on fasting glucose levels and A1C.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DM Type 1 and 2: Carbohydrate Management Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>DM Type 1 and 2: Carbohydrate Management Strategies</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should educate adults with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes on multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or insulin pump therapy on carbohydrate counting using insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios based on his or her abilities, preferences and management goals. Research reports that carbohydrate counting using insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios resulted in significant decreases in A1C of 0.4% to 1.6% and significant increases in quality of life, as well as continued maintenance of these improvements for up to 44 months. The majority of research reported no significant change in weight as a result of this carbohydrate management strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>DM: Educate Adults with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes on Fixed Insulin Doses or Adults with Type 2 Diabetes on Insulin Secretagogues</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should educate adults with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes on fixed insulin doses or adults with type 2 diabetes on insulin secretagogues, based on his or her abilities, preferences and management goals, on carbohydrate consistency (timing and amount) using one of the following carbohydrate management strategies:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Carbohydrate counting alone </li>
    <li>Plate method, portion control and simplified meal plan </li>
    <li>Food lists (such as <em>Choose Your Foods</em>, <em>Food Lists for Diabetes</em>) and carbohydrate choices </li>
</ul>
<p>For individuals using fixed insulin doses (or insulin secretagogues), consistent carbohydrate intake with respect to time and amount can result in improved glycemic control and reduce risk for hypoglycemia. Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control. A simple diabetes healthful eating plan approach such as portion control or healthful food choices may be better suited to individuals with type 2 diabetes who have low health literacy or numeracy concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>DM: Educate Adults with Type 2 Diabetes on MNT Alone or Non-Insulin Secretagogues</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should educate adults with type 2 diabetes on MNT alone or on diabetes medications other than insulin secretagogues, based on his or her abilities, preferences and management goals, on one of the following carbohydrate management strategies:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Carbohydrate counting alone </li>
    <li>Plate method, portion control and simplified meal plan </li>
    <li>Food lists (such as <em>Choose Your Foods</em>, <em>Food Lists for Diabetes</em>) and carbohydrate choices </li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DM Type 1 and 2: Fiber Intake</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>DM: Encourage Fiber Intake</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should encourage adults with diabetes to consume dietary fiber from foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, at the levels recommended by the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) (21 g to 25 g per day for adult women and 30 g to 38 g per day for adult men, depending on age) or U.S. Department of Agriculture (14 g fiber per 1,000 kcal) due to the overall health benefits of dietary fiber. Limited research regarding differing amounts of fiber intake from foods, independent of weight loss, reported mixed results on A1C and no significant effects on exogenous insulin levels.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DM Type 1 and 2: Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>DM: Advise on Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load</strong></p>
<p>If glycemic index or glycemic load is proposed as a glycemia-lowering strategy, the RDN can advise adults with diabetes that lowering glycemic index or glycemic load may or may not have a significant effect on glycemic control. Studies longer than 12 weeks report no significant impact of glycemic index or glycemic load, independent of weight loss, on A1C. However, mixed results were reported regarding fasting glucose levels and endogenous insulin levels.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DM Type 1 and 2: Nutritive Sweeteners</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>DM: Educate on Substitution of Nutritive Sweeteners for Other Carbohydrates</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should educate adults with diabetes that intake of nutritive sweeteners, when substituted isocalorically for other carbohydrates, will not have a significant effect on A1C or insulin levels. Research reported no significant impact of consuming nutritive sweeteners (such as isomaltulose and sucrose), independent of weight loss, on A1C or insulin levels. However, mixed results were reported regarding fasting blood glucose. </p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative </p>
<p><strong>DM: Advise Against Excessive Intake of Nutritive Sweeteners</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should advise adults with diabetes against excessive intake of nutritive sweeteners to avoid displacing nutrient-dense foods and to avoid excessive caloric and carbohydrate intake. Higher intake of added sugars may contribute to higher energy intake.</p>

<p><strong>DM: Educate on Intake of FDA-Approved Non-nutritive Sweeteners</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should educate adults with diabetes that intake of FDA-approved non-nutritive sweeteners (such as aspartame, sucralose and stevia) within the recommended daily intake levels established by FDA will not have a significant effect on glycemic control. Research reports no significant impact of consuming FDA-approved non-nutritive sweeteners (such as aspartame, stevia [steviol glycosides] and sucralose), independent of weight loss, on A1C, fasting glucose levels or insulin levels.</p>
<p><strong>Weak</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>DM: Educate About Substitution of FDA-Approved Non-nutritive Sweeteners</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should educate adults with diabetes that substituting foods and beverages containing FDA-approved non-nutritive sweeteners within the recommended daily intake levels established by FDA can reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake. However, other sources of calories and carbohydrates in these foods and beverages need to be considered. Use of non-nutritive sweeteners has the potential to reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake if substituted for caloric sweeteners without compensation by intake of additional calories from other food sources.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DM Type 1 and 2: Protein Intake and Protein Intake for Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>DM: Educate on Protein Intake and Hypoglycemia in Adults with Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should educate adults with diabetes that adding protein to meals and snacks does not prevent or assist in the treatment of hypoglycemia. Ingested protein appears to increase insulin response without increasing plasma glucose concentrations; therefore, carbohydrate sources high in protein should not be used to treat or prevent hypoglycemia. </p>
<p><strong>Fair</strong>, Imperative </p>
<p><strong>DM: No Protein Restriction for DKD</strong></p>
<p>For adults with diabetes and DKD, the RDN does not need to prescribe a protein restriction. While research reports mixed results regarding the effects of the amount of protein on fasting glucose levels and A1C, independent of weight loss, in adults with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes and DKD, there was no significant impact of protein intake (ranging from 0.7 g to 2.0 g per kg per day) on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). </p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>DM: Type of Protein and DKD</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should advise adults with type 2 diabetes and DKD that the type of protein (vegetable-based vs. animal-based) will not have a significant effect on GFR. However, there may be an effect on fasting glucose levels and proteinuria. While one study reports a positive impact of soy protein compared to animal protein on proteinuria and fasting glucose levels, independent of weight loss, in adults with type 2 diabetes and DKD, there was no significant impact of soy protein consumption on GFR. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DM Type 1 and 2: Cardioprotective Eating Pattern</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>DM: Encourage Cardioprotective Eating Pattern</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should encourage consumption of a cardioprotective dietary pattern, within the recommended energy intake. While research reports no significant effect of differing amounts of saturated fat, unsaturated fat and omega-3 fatty acids on glycemia or insulin levels, independent of weight loss, modifications to decrease saturated fat intake and increase unsaturated fat intake reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in three of six studies.</p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>DM: Encourage Individualized Reduction in Sodium Intake</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should encourage an individualized reduction in sodium intake. The recommendation for the general population to reduce sodium to less than 2,300 mg per day is also appropriate for adults with diabetes; for adults with both diabetes and hypertension, further reduction in sodium intake should be individualized.</p>

<p>If vitamin, mineral and herbal supplementation is proposed as a diabetes management strategy, the RDN can advise adults with diabetes that there is no clear evidence of benefit from supplementation in people who do not have underlying deficiencies. Routine supplementation with antioxidants (such as vitamins E and C and carotene) and other micronutrients (such as chromium, magnesium and vitamin D) and herbal supplements (such as cinnamon) are not advised due to lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DM Type 1 and 2: Physical Activity</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>DM: Encourage Individualized Physical Activity Plan</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should encourage an individualized physical activity plan for adults with diabetes, unless medically contraindicated, to gradually achieve the following: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Accumulating 150 minutes or more of physical activity per week </li>
    <li>Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (50% to 70% of maximum heart rate) spread over at least three days per week with no more than two consecutive days without exercise </li>
    <li>Resistance training at least twice per week </li>
    <li>Reduce sedentary time by breaking up extended amounts of time (more than 90 minutes) spent sitting. </li>
</ul>
<p>Adults with diabetes should be advised to perform at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (50% to 70% of maximum heart rate), spread over at least three days per week with no more than two consecutive days without exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>DM: Educate on Prevention and Treatment of Exercise-Related Hypoglycemia</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should educate adults with diabetes taking insulin or insulin secretagogues that physical activity may cause hypoglycemia if medication doses or carbohydrate consumption is not altered. Individual glycemic response patterns can differ markedly with exercise; therefore, persons with diabetes taking insulin or insulin secretagogues must use glucose monitoring and recognition of glucose patterns to make decisions to exercise safely.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Methods for Collecting/Selecting the Evidence</span></strong> </p>
<p>The following list provides an overview of the steps which the Academy evidence analysis team goes through to identify research through database searches.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Plan the search strategy</strong> to identify the current best evidence relevant to the question. The plan for identification and inclusion of articles and reports should be systematic and reproducible, not haphazard. Write out the original search strategy and document adjustments to the strategy if they occur. Allow for several iterations of searches.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>List inclusion and exclusion criteria</strong>. The workgroup will define the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria will be used in defining the search strategy and for filtering the identified research reports. The Academy uses only peer-reviewed research; that is, articles accepted for evidence analysis must be peer-reviewed and published in a juried publication. Additionally, the Academy only uses human subjects in its research and does not include animal studies in its evidence analysis. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify search words</strong>. During the process of considering outcomes, interventions, nutrition diagnoses, and assessments, the workgroup may have identified a number of specific terms or factors that were important, but were not included in the actual question. These terms can be used as additional search terms to help identify relevant pieces of research. Both text word search and keyword search using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) definitions may be used. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify databases to search</strong>. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, Agricola, DARE, TRIP, AHRQ and ERIC are some common databases for clinical nutritional research. Note that search terms can vary depending on the database. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conduct the search</strong>. Depending on the number and type of sources found in the initial search, adjustments might have to be made in the search strategy and to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and additional searches run. Changes to the search plan should be recorded for future reference. Document the number of sources identified in each search. </li>
    <li><strong>Review titles and abstracts</strong>. At this point, a filtering procedure is used to determine whether a research article matches the inclusion criteria and is relevant to the workgroup's questions. Typically, the lead analyst, along with a member of the expert workgroup, first reviews the citations and abstracts to filter out reports that are not applicable to the question. If a determination cannot be made based on the citation and abstract, then the full text of the article is obtained for review. </li>
    <li><strong>Gather all remaining articles and reports</strong>. Obtain paper or electronic copies of research articles that remain on the list following the citation and abstract review. If there are less than six citations, it could mean that the search was too specific to identify relevant research or that research has not been done on this topic. A broadened search should be tried. When there is a long list of citations, ascertain whether it includes articles that are tangential to the question or address the question in only a general way. In this case a more focused search strategy may be necessary. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Methods for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations in the guideline were based on a systematic review of the literature. Searches of PubMed were performed on the following topics:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) </li>
    <li>Carbohydrates (carbohydrate amount, carbohydrate management, fiber, glycemic index, nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners) </li>
    <li>Fat (fat amount, types of fat, omega-3 fatty acids) </li>
    <li>Protein (protein amount, types of protein [vegetable-based vs. animal-based]) </li>
</ul>
<p>Each evidence analysis topic has a link to supporting evidence, where the <strong>Search Plan and Results</strong> can be found. Here, the reader can view when the search plan was performed, inclusion and exclusion criteria, search terms, databases that were searched and the excluded articles.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 1: Formulate the Evidence Analysis Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Specify a focused question in a defined area of practice. Three key items are used to generate good quality questions: an analytical framework to identify links between factors and outcomes; the PICO (population, intervention, comparison intervention, outcome) format to write questions; and the Nutrition Care Process to serve as a framework.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 2: Gather and Classify the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>This step involves developing a search plan to conduct a detailed literature search. The search plan clearly defines the inclusion and exclusion criteria and identifies the key search terms and outcomes necessary to conduct a comprehensive search. The search plan and all literature searches results are documented and assessed for inclusion eligibility.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 3: Critically Appraise Each Article (Risk of Bias)</span></strong></p>
<p>This step involves critically assessing each included article for methodologic quality. Each study is evaluated based on appropriateness of study design and the quality of how the study was conducted by using the Academy's risk of bias tool called the Quality Criteria Checklist (QCC). </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 4: Summarize the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>This step involves achieving two major tasks. First, key data from the included articles is extracted by using the Academy's Web-based data extraction template. Second, summarizing the evidence extracted from each study into a brief, coherent, and easy-to-read summary. The end result of this phase is called the Evidence Summary.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 5: Write and Grade the Conclusion Statement</span> </strong></p>
<p>This step includes developing a concise conclusion statement for the research question and assigning a grade to the conclusion statement. The grade reflects the overall strength and weakness of evidence in forming the conclusion statement. The grading scale used by the Academy is: Grade I (good/strong), II (fair), III (limited/weak), IV (expert opinion only), or V (not assignable) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p>The expert workgroup, which includes practitioners and researches with a depth of experience in the specific field of interest, develops the disease-specific guideline. The guideline development involved the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Review the conclusion statements</strong>: The workgroup meets to review the materials resulting from the evidence analysis, which may include conclusion statements, evidence summaries, and evidence worksheets. </li>
    <li><strong>Formulate recommendations for the guideline integrating conclusions from evidence analysis</strong>: The workgroup uses an expert consensus method to formulate the guideline recommendations and complete the various sections on the recommendation page. These include:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>Recommendation(s)</strong>: This is a course of action for the practitioner. The recommendation is written using two brief and separate statements. The first statement is "what" the dietitian should do or not do. The second statement describes the "why" of the recommendation. More than one recommendation may be formulated depending on a particular topic and the supporting conclusion statements.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rating</strong>: The rating for the recommendation is based on the strength of the supporting evidence. The grade of the supporting conclusion statement(s) will be help determining this rating (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). </li>
            <li><strong>Label of conditional or imperative</strong>: Each recommendation will have a label of "conditional" or "imperative." Conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, while imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population without restraints on their pertinence. </li>
            <li><strong>Risks and harms of implementing the recommendations</strong>: Includes any potential risks, anticipated harms or adverse consequences associated with applying the recommendation(s) to the target population. </li>
            <li><strong>Conditions of application</strong>: Includes any organizational barriers or changes that would need to be made within an organization to apply the recommendation in daily practice. Also includes any conditions which may limit the application of the recommendation(s). For instance, application may be limited to only people in an inpatient setting, or not applicable for pregnant women. Facilitators for the application of the guideline may also be listed here. Conditional recommendations will always have conditions specified. Imperative recommendations may have some general conditions for application. </li>
            <li><strong>Potential costs associated with application</strong>: Includes any costs that may be associated with the application of this recommendation such as specialized staff, new equipment or treatments. </li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation narrative</strong>: Provides a brief description of the evidence that supports this recommendation. </li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation strength rationale</strong>: Provides a brief list of the evidence strength and methodological issues that determined the recommendation strength. </li>
            <li><strong>Minority opinions</strong>: If the expert workgroup cannot reach consensus on the recommendation, the minority opinions may be listed here. </li>
            <li><strong>Supporting evidence</strong>: Provides links to the conclusions statements, evidence summaries and worksheets related to the formulation of this recommendation(s). </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>References not graded in the Academy's evidence analysis process</strong>: Recommendations are based on the summarized evidence from the analysis. Sources that are not analyzed during the evidence analysis process may be used to support and formulate the recommendation or to support information under other categories on the recommendation page, if the workgroup deems necessary. References must be credible resources (e.g., consensus reports, other guidelines, position papers, standards of practice, articles from peer-reviewed journals, nationally recognized documents or Web sites). If recommendations are based solely on these types of references, they will be rated as "consensus." Occasionally recommendations will include references that were not reviewed during the evidence analysis process but are relevant to the recommendation, risks and harms of implementing the recommendation, conditions of application, or potential costs associated with application. These references will be listed on the recommendation page under "References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process." </li>
    <li><strong>Develop a clinical algorithm for the guideline</strong>: The workgroup develops a clinical algorithm based on Academy's Nutrition Care Process, to display how each recommendation can be used within the treatment process and how they relate to the Nutrition Assessment, Diagnosis, Intervention and Monitoring and Evaluation. </li>
    <li><strong>Complete the writing of the guideline</strong>: Each disease-specific guideline has a similar format which incorporates the Introduction (includes: Scope of the Guideline, Statement of Intent, Guideline Methods, Implementation, Benefits and Risks/Harms of Implementation), Background Information and any necessary Appendices. The workgroup develops these features. </li>
    <li><strong>Criteria used in guideline development</strong>: The criteria used in determining the format and process for development of Academy's guidelines are based on the following tools and criteria for evidence-based guidelines:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><a href="http://gem.med.yale.edu/default.htm" title="Guideline Elements Model (GEM) Web site">Guideline Elements Model (GEM),</a> which has been incorporated by the <a href="http://www.astm.org/" title="American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Web site">American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)</a> as a Standard Specification for clinical practice guidelines. </li>

<p>Recommendations are categorized in terms of either <em><strong>imperative</strong></em> or <em><strong>conditional</strong></em> statements.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em><strong>Imperative</strong></em> statements are broadly applicable to the target population and do not impose restraints on their pertinence. Imperative recommendations may include terms such as "should" or "may" and do not contain conditional text that would limit their applicability to specified circumstances. </li>
    <li><em><strong>Conditional</strong></em> statements clearly define a specific situation or population. Conditional recommendations are often presented in an if/then format, such that

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This nutrition practice guideline is meant to serve as a general framework for handling clients with particular health problems. The independent skill and judgment of the health care provider must always dictate treatment decisions. </li>
    <li>This guideline is intended for use by registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) involved in providing medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The application of the guideline must be individualized to assist the RDN to successfully integrate MNT into the overall medical management of adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. </li>
    <li>Evidence-based nutrition practice guidelines are developed to help registered dietitians, practitioners, patients, families, and consumers make shared decisions about health care choices in specific clinical circumstances. If properly developed, communicated, and implemented, guidelines can improve care. </li>
    <li>While the evidence-based nutrition practice guideline represents a statement of promising practice based on the latest available evidence at the time of publication, the guideline is not intended to overrule professional judgment. Rather, it may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. The independent skill and judgment of the health care provider must always dictate treatment decisions. These nutrition practice guidelines are provided with the express understanding that they do not establish or specify particular standards of care, whether legal, medical or other. </li>
    <li>This guideline recognizes the role of patient and family preferences for possible outcomes of care, when the appropriateness of a clinical intervention involves a substantial element of personal choice or values. With regard to types of evidence that are associated with particular outcomes, two major classes have been described. Patient-oriented evidence that matters (POEM) deals with outcomes of importance to patients, such as changes in morbidity, mortality, or quality of life. Disease-oriented evidence (DOE) deals with surrogate end-points, such as changes in laboratory values or other measures of response. Although the results of DOE sometimes parallel the results of POEM, they do not always correspond. When possible, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) recommends using POEM-type evidence rather than DOE. When DOE is the only guidance available, the guideline indicates that key clinical recommendations lack the support of outcomes evidence. </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The publication of this guideline is an integral part of the plans for getting the Academy medical nutrition therapy (MNT) evidence-based recommendations on medical nutrition therapy for type 1 and type 2 diabetes to all dietetics practitioners engaged in, teaching about or researching the topic. National implementation workshops at various sites around the country and during the Academy Food Nutrition Conference &amp; Expo (FNCE) are planned. Additionally, there are recommended dissemination and adoption strategies for local use of the <em>Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Diabetes Type 1 and 2 (2015) Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline</em>.</p>
<p>The guideline development team recommended multi-faceted strategies to disseminate the guideline and encourage its implementation. Management support and learning through social influence are likely to be effective in implementing guidelines in dietetic practice. However, additional interventions may be needed to achieve real change in practice routines.</p>
