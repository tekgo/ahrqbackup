Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of exposed infants born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women who received recommended virologic diagnostic testing for exclusion of HIV infection in the measurement year.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related morbidity and mortality has dropped dramatically due to advances in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment. But reductions are uneven across HIV-infected populations due to unequal access to care and variable quality of services provided. Quality management seeks to enhance the quality of HIV care provided and increase access to services. They do so by measuring how health and social services meet established professional standards and user expectations.</p>
<p>HIV virologic testing should be performed at a minimum at ages 14 to 21 days, 1 to 2 months and 4 to 6 months. </p>
<p>Antibiotic prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP) is recommended for infants with indeterminate HIV infection starting at 4 to 6 weeks of life or until they are determined to be uninfected. Diagnostic testing allows PCP prophylaxis to be avoided or stopped if confirmed uninfected (Working Group on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children, 2010).</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Public Health Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>"HIV infection should be diagnosed using HIV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) virologic assays. Maternal HIV antibody crosses the placenta and will be detectable in all HIV-exposed infants up to 18 months of age; therefore standard antibody tests should not be used for HIV diagnosis in newborns. HIV virologic testing should be performed at a minimum at ages 14 to 21 days, 1 to 2 months, and 4 to 6 months. Some experts also perform a virologic test at birth, especially if the woman has not had good virologic control during pregnancy or if adequate follow-up of the infant may not be assured. A positive HIV virologic test should be confirmed as soon as possible with a second HIV virologic test on a different specimen. Two positive HIV tests constitute a diagnosis of HIV infection" (Working Group on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children, 2010).</p>
<p>Definitive exclusion of HIV infection in nonbreastfed infants may be based on two negative virologic tests at greater than or equal to 1 month and greater than or equal to 4 months of age (Working Group on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children, 2010).</p></div>
