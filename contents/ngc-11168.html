<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Searches and Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Multiple literature searches were performed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) research staff using the PubMed database throughout the guideline development process.</p>
<p>Keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Insomnia OR sleep initiation and maintenance disorder NOT transient AND </li>
    <li>Clinical trial OR randomized controlled trial </li>
    <li>NOT editorial, letter, comment, case reports, biography, review </li>
</ul>
<p>The full literature search string can be found in the supplemental material in the original guideline document. Searches were performed on April 26, 2011 (search 1), May 12, 2014 (search 2), October 15, 2014 (search 3), and January 25, 2016 (search 4). Based on their expertise and familiarity with the insomnia literature, task force members submitted additional relevant literature and screened reference lists to identify articles of potential interest. This served as a "spot check" for the literature searches to ensure that important articles were not missed.</p>
<p>Abstracts from all retrieved articles were individually assessed by two task force members to determine whether the publication should be included or excluded from further consideration in the project. Exclusion criteria can be found in Figure 1 (see the original guideline document). A total of 129 publications were approved for inclusion.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Full texts of accepted articles were reviewed and data pertaining to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) for the outcomes of interest were extracted into spreadsheets by American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) staff. All data pertaining to adverse events were extracted into separate spreadsheets. Articles that met inclusion criteria but did not report outcomes of interest were rejected from the final evidence base. If outcome data were not presented in the format necessary for statistical analysis (i.e., mean, standard deviation, and sample size), the authors were contacted in an attempt to obtain the necessary data. Finally, clinicaltrials.gov was used as a final resource for attempting to obtain data necessary for completing statistical analyses. If the necessary data were not available from the publication, the author, or clinicaltrials.gov, the paper was included in the evidence base as supporting evidence, but was not used for statistical analysis or for determining quality of evidence.</p>
<p>For some drugs, none of the accepted publications provided data that could be used for statistical analysis. In these cases, the task force did not make a recommendation, but provided a literature review of these accepted papers instead. These publications are not included the evidence base flow diagram (Figure 1 of the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical and Meta-Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>For outcomes of interest, data from baseline and last-treatment time points were used for all statistical and meta-analyses. Data from crossover trials were treated as parallel groups. Change-from-baseline values were also used for statistical and meta-analyses, when the change-from-baseline standard deviation was provided or could be calculated from the provided statistic. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used for meta-analyses of quality of sleep (QOS) when data were reported using variable scales. Analyses were limited to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved doses. For adverse events, all data presented in the accepted papers were used for statistical and meta-analysis. All calculations and meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 software. Whenever possible, meta-analyses were performed by pooling data across studies for each outcome and adverse event. The evidence was grouped for analysis based on the drug, dosage, clinical outcome of interest, and methodology used to obtain the data (e.g., data obtained by polysomnography [PSG] were analyzed separately from data obtained by sleep diary).</p>
<p>All meta-analyses were performed as per-treatment analyses using the random effects model. For most interventions, absolute effects of drug treatments are represented by the mean difference (MD) &plusmn; standard deviation (SD) of post-treatment drug versus post-treatment placebo. Meta-analyses for adverse events are presented as risk difference. The result of each meta-analysis is displayed as a forest plot. Pooled results are expressed as the total number of patients, MD and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the experimental treatment and placebo.</p>
<p>Interpretation of clinical significance for outcomes of interest was conducted by comparing the absolute effects of drug treatment to the clinical significance threshold previously determined by the task force for each outcome of interest. Interpretation of adverse events was based upon the risk difference and clinical expertise of the task force.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The GRADE approach was used for the assessment of quality of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). For details on how the AASM uses GRADE to develop its clinical practice guidelines, refer to the AASM report by Morgenthaler et al. (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>For the determination of the quality of evidence for an intervention, the task force used objective data whenever possible (e.g., PSG). When only subjective data were available (e.g., sleep diaries), this evidence was used to determine the overall quality of evidence. The decision to use objective data as the primary determinant of quality of evidence was based on the preference for an objective measure of physiologic changes for determining clinically significant efficacy, the standardization of sleep parameter measurements and reporting, and the current requirements of PSG data for FDA approval of hypnotic medications. The results of this assessment are presented as summary of findings tables for each intervention (see Tables S1&ndash;S24 in the supplemental material in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Quality of evidence grades for randomized clinical trials begin at HIGH and are downgraded progressively for heterogeneity, imprecision, and/or potential publication bias. Since the vast majority of studies in this field are industry sponsored, the quality of evidence for nearly all of these studies is, therefore, reduced from HIGH to MODERATE. This is to be expected for clinical trials for many drugs (i.e. not only hypnotics), since the vast majority are industry-sponsored FDA registration studies. The extent to which this downgrading of evidence is warranted due to actual publication bias is unknown, but under the GRADE system the task force has chosen to adopt the conservative approach and assume risk of publication bias. When heterogeneity and imprecision are accounted for, the quality of evidence for many treatments considered is LOW or VERY LOW. These latter two factors are not uncommon, as there is substantial variability in sleep outcome variables across studies and confidence intervals frequently overlap the clinical thresholds for significance.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expert Task Force</span></strong></p>
<p>In order to develop this clinical practice guideline, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force composed of content experts in the field of insomnia, an AASM Board of Directors liaison, and AASM Science and Research Department staff members.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>A PICO (Patient [Population or Problem], Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes) question template was developed to be the focus of this guideline: "In adult patients diagnosed with primary chronic insomnia, how does [intervention] improve [outcomes], compared to placebo?"</p>
<p>The PICO question template was approved by the AASM Board of Directors. The task force identified the pharmacological interventions of interest, based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval status and common off-label usage. Based on their expertise, the task force developed a list of patient-oriented clinically relevant outcomes that are indicative of whether a treatment should be recommended for clinical practice. The task force then rated their relative importance and selected the top six outcomes. The following outcomes were determined to be "critical" or "important" for clinical decision making across all interventions: sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, quality of sleep, number of awakenings, and sleep efficiency (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). The task force then determined which outcomes were "critical" for clinical decision making for each individual intervention (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). Lastly, clinical significance thresholds, used to determine if a change in an outcome was clinically significant, were defined for each outcome by task force clinical judgement, prior to statistical analysis (see Table 3 in the original guideline document). These decisions were made by nominal consensus of the task force, based on their expertise and familiarity with the literature and clinical practice.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force developed recommendation statements consistent with Grades of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology based on the balance of the following factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Quality of evidence. Quality of evidence was based exclusively on the studies that could be included in meta-analyses. The task force determined their overall confidence that the estimated effect found in the literature was representative of the true treatment effect that patients would see, based on the following criteria: overall risk of bias (randomization, blinding, allocation concealment, selective reporting, and author disclosures); imprecision (when 95% confidence interval [CI] cross the clinical significance thresholds); inconsistency (I<sup>2</sup> cutoff of 75%); indirectness (study population); and risk of publication bias (funding sources). The task force also considered the consistency of the supporting evidence (i.e., data the met inclusion criteria, but could not be included in the meta-analyses). However such evidence did not impact judgments regarding the quality of evidence or final recommendations. </li>
    <li>Benefits versus harms. The task force determined if the beneficial outcomes of the intervention outweighed any harmful side effects based on the following criteria: meta-analysis (if applicable); analysis of any harms/side effects reported within the accepted literature; and the clinical expertise of the task force. </li>
    <li>Patient values and preferences. The task force determined if patient values and preferences would be generally consistent, and if patients would use the intervention based on the body of evidence reviewed. These judgments were based on the clinical expertise of the task force members and any data published on the topic relevant to patient preferences. </li>
</ol>
<p>Taking these major factors into consideration, and adhering to GRADE recommendations, the task force assigned a direction (for or against) and strength (Strong or Weak) for each recommendation statement (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>Additional information is provided in the form of "Remarks" immediately following the recommendation statements, when deemed necessary by the task force (see the "Major Recommendations" field). Remarks are based on the evidence evaluated during the systematic review, and are intended to provide context for the recommendations.</p>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Numerous investigations have demonstrated that hypnotic medications are comparably efficacious to cognitive behavioral therapies for insomnia (CBT-I) during acute treatment. However, these studies also make clear that the gains associated with CBT-I are durable following completion of treatment, whereas those associated with medication tend to dissipate following discontinuation of the drug. The vast majority of investigations which are included in the current analysis address relatively short-term use (e.g., one day to five weeks). Some studies have shown that long-term treatment with at least newer generation benzodiazepine receptor agonistic modulator (BzRA) hypnotics can be safe and effective under properly controlled conditions.</p>
<p>See the original guideline document for detailed discussions of the balance of benefits versus harms for each drug considered for treatment of chronic insomnia.</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The data on adverse effects derived from clinical trials, in general, do not suggest a high frequency of serious side effects. However, the data are scant and inconsistent, suggesting that caution should be applied in the assessment of relative risks associated with use of hypnotic medications. Other reported adverse effects include&mdash;but are not limited to&mdash;dependency/withdrawal, cognitive impairment, falls/fractures, parasomnias, and driving impairment and motor vehicle accidents. Epidemiological studies have also suggested a possible link between hypnotic use and infection, depression and overall mortality risk. These complications are observed most frequently in older populations, who are among the most frequent users of these drugs. Risks of dependency and serious withdrawal complications are of greatest concern with true benzodiazepine agents, particularly in the setting of escalating, long-term usage and insufficient monitoring. However, although much concern has understandably been raised about potential tolerance and addiction to these drugs, there is limited information regarding the true incidence of these complications. The risks associated with use of these agents are clearly increased not only in the elderly but also when they are used in dosages in excess of those recommended, or when combined with other psychoactive agents. Given the known sedative effects of these agents, particularly those with longer half-lives, clinicians must be diligent in cautioning patients regarding potential complications related to sedation. Such complications are most likely to occur with longer-acting agents and during morning hours following bedtime administration. Use of shorter-acting agents and the lowest effective dosage may help to reduce sedation-related complications. Appropriate patient counseling and careful monitoring will also serve to minimize risk. Complete avoidance of these medications should also be considered in those who may be particularly susceptible to adverse outcomes.</p>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This clinical practice guideline is intended to serve as one component in an ongoing assessment of the individual patient with insomnia. As discussed elsewhere, a comprehensive initial evaluation should include a detailed history of sleep complaints, medical and psychiatric history, and medication/substance use. These factors, together with patient preferences and treatment availability, should be used to select specific treatments for specific patients. This clinical practice guideline is not intended to help clinicians determine which patient is appropriate for pharmacotherapy. Rather, it is intended to provide recommendations regarding specific insomnia drugs once the decision has been made to use pharmacotherapy. This guideline is also not intended to recommend one drug over another. Very few comparative efficacy studies have been conducted among these agents. Rather, the guideline provides a recommendation and evidence base for each individual drug. The selection of a particular drug should rest on the evidence summarized in the original guideline document, as well as additional patient-level factors, such as the optimal pharmacokinetic profile, assessments of benefits versus harms, and past treatment history. </li>
    <li>This guideline should be used in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chronic</span> insomnia. These guidelines indicate that cognitive behavioral therapies for insomnia (CBT-I) is a standard of treatment and that such treatment carries a significantly favorable benefit:risk ratio. Therefore, based on these guidelines, all patients with chronic insomnia should receive CBT-I as a primary intervention. Medications for chronic insomnia disorder should be considered mainly in patients who are unable to participate in CBT-I, who still have symptoms despite participation in such treatments, or, in select cases, as a temporary adjunct to CBT-I. </li>
    <li>The recommendations in this guideline define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most adult patients, when pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia is indicated. This guideline should not, however, be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably used to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician, in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options and resources, as well as safety considerations. </li>
    <li>The AASM expects this guideline to have an impact on professional behavior, patient outcomes, and, possibly, health care costs. This clinical practice guideline reflects the state of knowledge at the time of publication and will be reviewed and updated as new information becomes available. </li>
    <li>The existing data regarding sleep-promoting medications imposes limits on the degree of confidence as a result of several factors. These include: (1) a high degree of variability in the statistical information presented; (2) a significant degree of variability in sleep outcomes within and across studies; (3) industry sponsorship; (4) a paucity of systematic data collection and analysis of treatment-emergent adverse events; and (5) absence of outcome data (such as functional status or prevention of complications of chronic insomnia) that would inform judgments regarding the impact of therapy. </li>
    <li>See "Discussion and Future Directions," "Defining Efficacy" and "Understanding the Methodology" in the original guideline document for additional qualifying statements regarding the recommendations in this guideline. </li>
