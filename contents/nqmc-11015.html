<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percent of lymphoma patients who are 65 years old or older and receiving CHOP +/-R (or any regimen with the same or higher doses of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin and, thus, with an equivalent or higher potential for neutropenia), prescribed prophylactic myeloid growth factor (MGF) (filgrastim, filgrastim-sndz, tbo-filgrastim or pegfilgrastim). </p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Support (verbatim) from guidelines</em>:<br />
Prophylactic colony-stimulating factor (CSF) for patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma aged 65 and older treated with curative chemotherapy (CHOP or more aggressive regimens) should be given to reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) and infections (Smith et al., 2006). </p>
<p>Meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials on the prophylactic use of recombinant granulocyte CSFs has confirmed their effectiveness in reducing the risk of febrile neutropenia. Some concerns have been expressed that the combination of growth factors and topoisomerase II inhibitors may be associated with increased risk of acute leukemia; however, these data are controversial. Despite these caveats, the use of growth factors appears to be the best established strategy to improve treatment in this group of patients (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2015). </p>
<p>The development of FN is a common dose-limiting toxicity of many single agent and combination chemotherapy regimens that is directly related to the intensity of the regimen. Clinical trial data of chemotherapy regimens that have an incidence of FN greater than 20% in chemotherapy-na&iuml;ve patients are considered by the panel as high risk. It is emphasized that the type of chemotherapy regimen is only one component of the risk assessment and needs to be combined with patient risk factors for an estimation of the overall risk for FN. The most important risk factor for developing severe neutropenia is higher age, notably over 65 years, inpatients who receive full chemotherapy dose intensity (NCCN, 2016). </p>
<p>The NCCN, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guidelines all recognize a variety of special circumstances in which patients treated with relatively nonmyelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens are at high risk for FN due to bone marrow compromise or comorbidity. Prophylactic MGF is recommended for any patient considered at high risk, regardless of treatment intent (NCCN, 2016). </p>
<p>ASCO guidelines recommend using white cell-stimulating factors when the risk of FN secondary to a recommended chemotherapy regimen is approximately 20% and equally effective treatment programs that do not require white cell-stimulating factors are unavailable. Exceptions should be made when using regimens that have a lower chance of causing FN if it is determined that the patient is at high risk for this complication (as a result of age, medical history, or disease characteristics) (Schnipper et al., 2012).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Guideline statements on gap</em>:<br />
There remains wide variation in the appropriate use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) for primary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia (FN) in clinical practice. This variation from guideline standards results in increased use of these costly agents when the risk of FN is low. Conversely, the risk and morbidity of FN are increased when these agents are withheld as primary prophylaxis, contrary to guidelines (Schnipper et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Neutropenia and resulting FN can be induced by myelosuppressive chemotherapy. FN in turn is a major dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapy, often requiring prolonged hospitalization and broad-spectrum antibiotic use. These can prompt dose reductions or treatment delays in subsequent chemotherapy cycles and compromise clinical outcome. A review by Dale et al. (2002) showed that about 25% to 40% of treatment-na&iuml;ve patients develop FN with common chemotherapy regimens. Development of FN increases diagnostic and treatment costs and often leads to longer hospital stays. In addition, correlations have been reported between changes in neutrophil counts and quality of life, as measured by physical functioning, vitality, and mental health (Schnipper et al., 2012).</p>
<p><em>Statement from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Lymphoma Task Force on gap</em>: <br />
This measure has been in use for the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification Performance Improvement Module since July 2013. Performance over the first 10 months (through May 2014) among this highly select group of hematologists is 82%. We believe performance among all hematologists would be somewhat lower. Due to the significant morbidity and costs associated with neutropenia, we suggest this gap remains significant.</p></div>
