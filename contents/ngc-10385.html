<p><strong>Primary Therapy for Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma</strong></p>
<p>Chemotherapy is recommended for metastatic upper tract tumours. Please refer to the CancerControl Alberta guideline <a href="http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/hp/if-hp-cancer-guide-gu002-bladder.pdf" title="Alberta Health Services Web site">Bladder Cancer</a> (GU-002) for treatment options. </p>
<p><strong>Adjuvant Therapy</strong></p>
<p>The decision as to whether to give adjuvant therapy is based on the pathologic stage of disease. For staging, refer to the Appendix in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><em>pT0-1 Disease</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>No adjuvant therapy is recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>T2-4, N+ Disease</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Chemotherapy is usually given as cisplatinum-based combination therapy (e.g., cisplatinum, 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000&ndash;1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 and 8 q 21 days). </li>
        <li>Adjuvant therapy should be given when renal function is optimal. </li>
        <li>Patients who are ineligible for cisplatinum based combination therapy in the adjuvant setting should not routinely receive carboplatinum-based regimens as there is no evidence for benefit. </li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-up</span></strong></p>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (patient or population, intervention, comparisons, outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What staging investigations are required for patients with upper tract tumours? </li>
    <li>What are the appropriate treatment options (i.e., surgery, systemic therapy, etc.) for patients with upper tract tumours? </li>
    <li>What is a reasonable follow-up strategy for patients who have completed treatment for upper tract tumours? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The PubMed database was searched for relevant literature using the following search terms: (renal pelvis AND neoplasm) OR (ureter AND neoplasm) AND transitional cell carcinoma. Results were limited to clinical trials, practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published from 1991 through 2012 March. The Medline database was also searched using the MeSH terms "Carcinoma, Transitional Cell" with subheadings drug therapy, radiotherapy, surgery and therapy, combined with the MeSH terms "Kidney Pelvis" and "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms." Results were limited to literature published between 1990 and 2012 March. Based on feedback from the working group, the Medline database was searched subsequently using the MeSH terms "Carcinoma, Transitional Cell" AND "Neoadjuvant therapy" with subheading drug therapy. Results were limited to literature published from 1990 through 2012 July. Non-relevant publications were excluded, as well as any publications that did not report survival outcomes.</p>
<p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), Cancer Council Australia (CCA), and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) websites were searched for guidelines on the management of upper tract tumours.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Genitourinary Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Trust Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Genitourinary Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
