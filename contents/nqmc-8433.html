Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>As part of the Minnesota Adverse Health Event law, wrong site, procedure and patient events are reported directly to the Minnesota Department of Health and are disclosed to the public on an annual basis. Fortunately, while these events are very rare (1:50,000 invasive procedures including the operating room [OR]), facilities in Minnesota continue to work hard at preventing wrong site, wrong patient and wrong procedure events outside of the OR. The <em>Eighth Annual Public Report of Adverse Events in Minnesota</em> states that 36% of the total wrong site, patient or procedure events occurred in non-OR settings. </li>
    <li>An observational study has shown that ineffective team communication is often a root cause for a medical event, and ineffective team communications can have immediate, negative effects on patient safety. </li>
</ul>
