<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Spleen damage is a common and crucial characteristic of sickle cell disease (SCD): a damaged spleen cannot effectively clear bacteria from the blood, leaving SCD patients, particularly young children, highly susceptible to infection. Children with SCD have rates of infection caused by bacterial pneumonia 30 to 100 times that of children without SCD, and pneumonia vaccines are of limited effectiveness in this age group because of low antibody response. However, twice‐daily doses of an antibiotic sharply reduce the incidence of pneumonia in children with SCD.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that children with SCD who are enrolled in Medicaid frequently are not dispensed medication soon enough or in sufficient quantities to cover ongoing daily use of an antibiotic. Sometimes these children receive no antibiotics at all, even though this simple precaution greatly reduces their risk of contracting a debilitating and often deadly infection. Clinical guidelines and the results of randomized controlled trials indicate that providers should prescribe appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis to children with SCD who are under 5 years of age. There are no existing quality measures for antibiotic prophylaxis in children with SCD.</p>
<p>Prompt initiation and consistent use of antibiotics in young children with SCD increases survival rates through the prevention of overwhelming bacterial infections (National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute [NHLBI], 2002). Because sickle cells obstruct blood flow to the spleen, splenic function is compromised, leading to susceptibility to bacterial infections (NHLBI, 2002). Meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis are major causes of death in children with SCD, and pneumococcal sepsis is known to progress from the onset of fever to death in fewer than 12 hours (Gaston et al., 1986). Given that the highest rate of infection occurs in children with SCD under the age of 3 years (Hirst &amp; Owusu-Ofori, 2010), NHLBI guidelines recommend that infants identified through newborn screening (NBS) as having SCD should be started on daily prophylactic penicillin as early as possible (NHLBI, 2002).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Prevalence and Incidence</em><br />
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States (Kavanagh et al., 2011). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (2002) estimates that 2,000 infants are born with SCD in the United States (U.S.) each year. SCD affects 70,000 to 100,000 children and adults in the United States, predominantly those of African and Hispanic descent (Hassell, 2010). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Pathology and Severity</em><br />
Vaso-occlusion (the sudden blockage of a blood vessel caused by the sickle shape of abnormal blood cells) is responsible for most complications of SCD, including pain episodes, sepsis, stroke, acute chest syndrome, priapism, leg ulcers, osteonecrosis and renal insufficiency (Steinberg, 1999). In addition, SCD can have hemolytic and infectious complications that result in morbidity and mortality in children with SCD (Kavanagh et al., 2011). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Burden in Daily Life</em><br />
The effect of SCD on children and families is significant: severe pain episodes and hospitalizations restrict daily activities and reflect negatively on school attendance and performance, sleep, and social activities (Lemanek, Ranalli, &amp; Lukens, 2009; Alvim et al., 2005). Although medical management of SCD continues to improve over time, 196 U.S. children died from SCD-related causes between 1999 and 2002 (Yanni et al., 2009). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Cost</em><br />
In a study of health care utilization among low income children with SCD between 2004 and 2007, 27% of these children required inpatient hospitalization and 39% used emergency care during a year. Of these children, 63% averaged one well-child visit per year and 10% had at least one outpatient visit with a specialist (Raphael et al., 2009). Patients with SCD use many parts of the health care system, incurring significant costs. In 2009, mean hospital charges for children with SCD and a hospital stay were $23,000 for children with private insurance and $18,200 for children enrolled in Medicaid (HCUPnet, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, 2012). Kauf et al. (2009) estimate the lifetime cost of health care per patient with SCD to be approximately $460,000. </p>
<p><em>Performance Gap &ndash; Prophylactic Antibiotics</em><br />
In a 10-year retrospective cohort study of 407 infants enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program, 60% of infants with SCD did not have prophylactic antibiotic prescriptions filled within the recommended period (i.e., the first 12 weeks of life) (Warren et al., 2010). The study was based on pharmacy claims data, and therefore it is unknown whether parents did not fill prescriptions or if providers did not prescribe the recommended prophylactic antibiotics. Regardless, the majority of infants with SCD in this study did not receive the recommended antibiotics.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability</strong><br />
<em>Data/Sample</em>. This measure is based on data from state newborn screening (NBS) programs, which are active in every state. Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC) tested this measure using NBS results from three state public health agencies: Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. NBS program data captures the vast majority of births in the United States; in Michigan, 97% of all children have NBS performed, while in Illinois the figure is nearly 99%; the remaining births opt out of NBS based on religious grounds.</p>
<p>This measure was tested as specified, which requires an assessment among the entire population of a state's birth cohort that had an initial NBS indicating sickle cell disease (SCD). This measure includes no sampling; consequently, no sampling error is introduced that would necessitate the calculation of measure reliability.</p>
<p>Results for the measures when tested in Illinois and Michigan are shown in Tables 5 of the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><br />
The validity of this measure was determined through face validity established by a national panel of experts and advocates for families of children with SCD. Face validity is the degree to which the measure construct characterizes the concept being assessed, which was established by two Q-METRIC SCD expert panels. The panel established a very high degree of face validity for this measure through a detailed review of concepts and metrics considered to be essential to effective SCD management and treatment. The Q-METRIC expert panel included nationally recognized experts in SCD, representing hematology, pediatrics, and SCD family advocacy. In addition, measure validity was considered by experts in state Medicaid program operations, health plan quality measurement, health informatics, and health care quality measurement. In total, the Q-METRIC SCD expert panels included 14 experts, providing a comprehensive perspective on SCD management and the measurement of quality metrics for states and health plans.</p>
<p>From this group, concepts and draft measures were rated for their relative importance. This measure was among the most highly rated, with the expert panel's average score of 8.6 (out of a maximum of 9). Two rating methods were used to minimize any potential bias due to outlier ratings; this measure received identically high ratings (8.6) using both methods. In addition, the expert panelists noted that this measure not only was important, but could be accessed through state health departments and would likely have a high degree of availability from pharmacy prescription claims records. </p>
<p>Validity testing for this measure comparing data from the Michigan newborn screening program with claims data pulled from the Community Health Automated Medicaid Processing System (CHAMPS) showed moderate to high levels of agreement for 2010 and 2011, respectively (Table 6 in the original measure documentation). Among SCD cases enrolled in Medicaid during the first 90 days of life, there was a 58% agreement between the SCD case roster and Michigan claims data in 2010 (36%+22%). For 2011, the agreement increased substantially to 80% (47%+33%).</p></div>
