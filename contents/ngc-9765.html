Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendations (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Subaxial Injury Classification (SLIC) and severity scale is recommended as a classification system for spinal cord injury. This system includes morphological, ligamentous, and neurological information in its scoring, thus communicating a greater amount of information regarding the extent of the patient's injury. Its overall inter-rater reliability has an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.71. </li>
    <li>The Cervical Spine Injury Severity Score (CSISS) is recommended as a classification system for graded instability and fracture patterns in patients with spinal cord injury. Although there is excellent reliability (intraobserver and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients for 15 reviewers were 0.977 and 0.883, respectively), the system is somewhat complicated, and its use may be limited to clinical trials rather than daily practice. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level III</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Harris classification of subaxial spinal injury is not recommended for describing the bony and soft tissue characteristics seen on imaging studies in spinal cord injury due to its low reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.42). It may be used in addition to more reliable measures for comparison to previous or other studies using this system. </li>
    <li>The Allen classification of subaxial spinal injury is not recommended for describing the mechanistic and imaging findings in cervical spine and spinal cord injury due to its low reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.53). Fortunately, this classification system is not in widespread use. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>The challenge confronting providers caring for patients with cervical spine traumatic injuries is how to quantify instability and create an algorithm of treatment in order to protect the spinal cord from further damage, prevent future spinal deformity and mitigate pain and discomfort. Biomechanical, cadaveric, and autopsy studies have confirmed the importance of ligamentous integrity of anterior and posterior cervical spine elements for smooth, effortless movements of cervical spine under physiological loads. Due to the lack of appropriate sectional imaging, previous investigators have resorted to major injury vectors (MIV) in order to construct descriptive mechanical classification of cervical spine injuries. However, these systems are complicated and difficult to use; their clinical relevance is not intuitive. In addition, their reliability is low, and they probably do not add value to clinical research on spinal cord injury. The only suggestion might be to use the Harris classification system in addition to a more reliable classification for comparison with previously reported studies using this older scheme.</p>
<p>Anatomical injury severity is one of the major independent variables that needs to be quantified for future therapeutic trials. Two partially validated classification systems, the SLIC and severity scale and the CSISS, have tried to scale and score injury severity, taking advantage of sectional imaging.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A computerized search of the National Library of Medicine (PubMed) database of English literature published from 1966 to 2011 was performed focusing on human studies and subaxial cervical spine injury classification systems using MEDLINE medical subject headings and keywords "cervical spine trauma," "cervical spine injury," "cervical spine injury classification," and "subaxial cervical spine injury." Approximately 28,500 citations were obtained. Additional search terms "Cervical Spine Injury Classification" resulted in 593 citations, "lower cervical spine injury classification" resulted in 87 citations, and "subaxial cervical spine injury classification" resulted in 25 citations. Titles and abstracts of these 112 manuscripts were reviewed. Additional publications were cross-referenced from the citation lists of these papers. Finally, the members of the author groups were asked to contribute articles known to them on the subject matter that were not found by other search means. Duplications, case reports, pharmacokinetic reports, general reviews, editorials, and critiques were excluded.</p></div>

<p>Articles that did not achieve immediate consensus among the author group were discussed extensively until a consensus was reached. Very few contributions required extensive discussion.

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
