Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: This document provides guidance to perioperative, endoscopy, and sterile processing personnel for processing all types of reusable flexible endoscopes and accessories. Recommendations are provided for design and construction of the endoscopy suite as well as for controlling and maintaining the environment to support processing activities. Guidance is provided for maintaining records of processing for traceability and for quality assurance measures related to processing flexible endoscopes and accessories.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>Flexible endoscopes should be processed in an area designed and constructed to support processing activities (Alvarado &amp; Reichelderfer, 2000; "Guidelines for design and construction", 2014; "ANSI/AAMI ST91", 2015; Health Service Executive Advisory Group [HSE], 2012; "Clarification", 2012; "Infection control in endoscopy", 2010; Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates, 2013; Hookey et al., 2013; Du Rand et al., 2013; World Gastroenterology Organization/World Endoscopy Organization, 2015). </li>
    <li>Flexible endoscopes should be processed in an area controlled and maintained to support processing activities (Alvarado &amp; Reichelderfer, 2000; "Guidelines for design and construction", 2014; "ANSI/AAMI ST91", 2015; HSE, 2012; "Clarification", 2012; "Infection control in endoscopy", 2010; Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates, 2013; Hookey et al., 2013; Du Rand et al., 2013; World Gastroenterology Organization/World Endoscopy Organization, 2015; "Choice framework", 2013). </li>
    <li>Flexible endoscopes and accessories should be precleaned at the point of use. </li>
    <li>After precleaning at the point of use, contaminated flexible endoscopes and accessories should be transported to the endoscopy processing room. </li>
    <li>Flexible endoscopes designed to be leak tested, should be leak tested after each use, after any event that may have damaged the endoscope, and before use of a newly purchased, repaired, or loaned endoscope. </li>
    <li>After leak testing and before high-level disinfection or sterilization, flexible endoscopes should be manually cleaned. </li>
    <li>Flexible endoscopes, accessories, and associated equipment should be visually inspected for cleanliness, integrity, and function before use, during the procedure, after the procedure, after cleaning, and before disinfection or sterilization. </li>
    <li>After manual cleaning and inspection, flexible endoscopes and endoscope accessories should be high-level disinfected or sterilized (Rutala &amp; Weber, 2008). </li>
    <li>Flexible endoscopes and endoscope accessories should be stored in a manner that minimizes contamination and protects the device or item from damage (Alvarado &amp; Reichelderfer, 2000; "ANSI/AAMI ST91", 2015; HSE, 2012; Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates, 2013; ASGE Quality Assurance In Endoscopy Committee et al., 2011; Rutala &amp; Weber, 2008; Rudy, Adams, &amp; Waddington, 2012; Clemens et al., 2010). </li>
    <li>The health care organization should maintain records of flexible endoscope processing and procedures. </li>
    <li>Personnel with responsibility for processing flexible endoscopes should receive initial and ongoing education and complete competency verification activities related to processing flexible endoscopes. </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for processing flexible endoscopes should be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting in which they are used. </li>
    <li>The health care organization's quality management program should evaluate processing of flexible endoscopes. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic search of the databases Ovid MEDLINE&reg;, EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL&reg;), and Scopus&reg; as well as of the Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Search results were limited to literature published in English from 1994 through 2014. At the time of the initial search, the librarian established weekly alerts on the search topics and until October 2015, presented relevant results to the lead author. The author and the librarian also identified relevant guidelines and guidance from government agencies, professional organizations, and standards-setting bodies. Finally, during the development of this guideline, the author requested supplementary searches for topics not included in the original search as well as articles and other sources that were discovered during the evidence-appraisal process.</p>
<p>Search terms included the subject headings <em>endoscopes, disinfection, decontamination, sterilization, disinfectants, detergents, biofilms, infection control, cross-infection, equipment contamination, occupational exposure, protective clothing,</em> and <em>hypersensitivity</em>. Subject headings and key words for specific types of endoscopes, bacteria, disinfectants, and protective devices also were included, as were headings and terms related to the concepts of endoscope storage, methods of reprocessing, disinfection monitoring, infection transmission, disposable and reusable equipment, occupational allergies and injuries, and air pollution and ventilation. Complete search strategies are available upon request.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed or retracted publications and evidence specific to the mechanism of action or health hazards associated with specific high-level disinfectants or liquid chemical sterilants, rigid endoscopic instrumentation, endoscopic medical treatment protocols, techniques, patient management, or functional design of flexible endoscopes.</p></div>
