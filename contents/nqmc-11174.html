<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, with a current diagnosis of stage 0 through IIC melanoma or a history of melanoma of any stage, without signs or symptoms suggesting systemic spread, seen for an office visit during the one-year measurement period, for whom no diagnostic imaging studies were ordered.</p>
<p>This measure is to be reported <span style="text-decoration: underline;">once per performance period</span> for patients with a current diagnosis of stage 0 through IIC melanoma or a history of melanoma who are seen for an office visit during the performance period. This measure is intended to reflect the quality of services provided for the primary management of patients with melanoma who have an office visit during the performance period. </p>
<p>There are two reporting criteria for this measure:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with a diagnosis of stage 0 through IIC melanoma without signs or symptoms suggesting systemic spread
    <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>Patients with a history of any stage melanoma without signs or symptoms suggesting systemic spread </li>
</ol>
<p>Although this measure contains two reporting criteria, there is <strong>only</strong> one reporting rate and one performance rate for this measure. </p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There is no valid indication for expensive imaging studies in early stage melanoma in the absence of signs or symptoms. There is a perception that radiologic studies are being administered for grade 0 and grade I melanoma that are clinically unnecessary and create economic burden to the patient and payer. While diagnostic imaging is also inappropriate for patients with higher stages of melanoma as well, this measure is a first step in addressing the over-utilization of diagnostic imaging studies in patients with melanoma.</p>
<p>Diagnostic imaging is the fastest growing medical expenditure in the United States with an annual 9% growth rate &ndash; more than twice that of general medical expenditures. Studies have found overuse of diagnostic imaging and duplication of other types of scans add little or no value. Unnecessary or inappropriate tests not only incur excess expenditures, but may also expose patients to extra risk. For example, the radiation exposure of a computed tomography (CT) scan can be several hundred times that of a chest x-ray. The advances in cardiac imaging have resulted in the inappropriate application of these imaging modalities resulting in substantial, unexplained regional variability and increased attendant costs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Recommendation Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>In asymptomatic patients with localized cutaneous melanoma of any thickness, baseline blood tests and imaging studies are generally not recommended and should only be performed as clinically indicated for suspicious signs and symptoms (Bichakjian et al., 2011). </p>
<p>Routine cross-sectional imaging (CT, positron emission tomography [PET], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is not recommended for patient with localized melanoma. For patients with stage IA melanoma, this is consistent with the National Institutes of Health guideline. For patients with stage IB to IIC, this recommendation is based on the very low yield of detection of subclinical disease. In patients with stage IIB to IIC, chest x-ray is optional. In any patient with localized melanoma, cross-sectional imaging should only be used to investigate specific signs or symptoms (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2011). </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) in collaboration with the American Academy of Dermatology conducted a testing project to ensure that the melanoma measures were feasible to implement, valid and reliable. Overall, the measures were found to be valid and reliable.</p>
<p><em>Face Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Face validity of the measure score was assessed for three of the four melanoma measures. The American Academy of Dermatology Quality Metrics Committee members were asked to empirically assess face validity of these measures via online survey. The expert panel consisted of 13 members, whose specialties include oncology, melanoma, dermatology, and surgical oncology. </p>
<p>After the measure was fully specified, the expert panel was asked to rate their agreement with the following statement: "The scores obtained from the measure, as specified, will provide an accurate reflection of quality and can be used to distinguish good and poor quality."</p>

<p><em>Reliability Testing </em></p>
<p>Inter-rater reliability testing (i.e., manual review of the patient medical record by two trained clinical abstractors and comparison of their individual findings) was conducted at three dermatology practice sites on three of the four melanoma measures (i.e., measures 2, 3 and 4). These sites represent various types, locations, and sizes. Kappa statistics were calculated at the data element level for the denominator, numerator and exceptions categories. Data element reliability was established based on the results of this analysis. </p>
<p><em>Reliability Testing Results</em></p>
<p>The PCPI measure testing project revealed that the data elements for measure 2 demonstrated moderate to almost perfect reliability, the data elements for measure 3 demonstrated fair to almost perfect reliability and the data elements for measure 4 demonstrated moderate to almost perfect reliability in the numerator category. </p></div>
