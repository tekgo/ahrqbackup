<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Retrieval</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence for safety, effectiveness and satisfaction was drawn from randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted-time-series studies. Evidence for acceptability came from qualitative or mixed-method studies with a qualitative component. For the evidence on feasibility, all documented information related to task shifting in abortion care in five countries (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nepal, South Africa and Uruguay) was collected. The countries were selected to represent a diversity of regions and examples where national or subnational programmes on task shifting related to abortion care are already being implemented. </p>
<p>Existing reviews that directly or indirectly addressed the questions of interest were identified and their usefulness for this guideline was assessed before a search for further evidence was initiated. Seven reviews addressing effectiveness, two reviews addressing acceptability and a feasibility case study synthesis were undertaken specifically for this guideline. In addition, findings from three existing systematic reviews on effectiveness of pharmacists in providing other types of health interventions, and six existing qualitative systematic reviews and multicountry studies of the implementation of similar health worker programmes for other maternal health tasks were also incorporated into the evidence base. </p>
<p>Search strategies were specific to each question &ndash; they are described in full in the respective reviews in Web Supplements 2 and 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). In general, databases were searched from inception to 2014, without language filters and for low- and middle-income as well as high-income countries. The databases searched included the following: African Index Medicus, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, CINAHL, Cochrane Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, EBSCO, EMBASE, Global Index Medicus, Index Medicus for South-East Asia, Index Medicus for WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, LILACS, Ovid MEDLINE, Popline, PubMed, Western Pacific Regional Index Medicus. </p>
<p>A special effort was made to identify and include non-English language literature for the acceptability/feasibility outcomes and most of the documented materials for the case study on Uruguay were in Spanish. Reference lists of key articles were also hand searched and external experts were contacted to identify additional relevant studies, including reports of completed trials that had not yet been published. For the case study synthesis, documented literature was supplemented with interviews with knowledgeable in-country experts. Figure 2 in the original guideline document charts the geographical spread of the data included in the evidence base. Titles and abstracts were screened by two members of the review team and the full texts of shortlisted articles were further screened to determine if they met inclusion criteria.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>For the safety and effectiveness findings, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) profiler, GRADEpro, was used to create evidence profiles and Summary of Findings tables. Forest plots were made to graphically illustrate the relative risk estimates. Meta-analyses were performed when more than one trial reported risk estimates relevant to outcomes. For qualitative reviews, two individuals identified the key findings relevant to the scope of the guidance. Findings were organized into Summary of Findings tables.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Confidence in the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The certainty (i.e., the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of the effect or association is correct) of the benefits and harms outcomes was assessed using the GRADE approach. Five criteria &ndash; study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias &ndash; were used to assess the certainty for each outcome. Evidence was downgraded by one level for serious and by two levels for very serious limitations. Assessments were made independently by two GRADE methodologists. </p>
<p>Confidence in findings from the reviews of qualitative studies was assessed with the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Quality Research (CERQual) tool, utilizing an approach similar to GRADE. Each review finding was assessed on four factors: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The methodological limitations of the individual qualitative studies contributing to the review finding, assessed using an appropriate qualitative critical appraisal tool; </li>
    <li>The relevance of a review finding, assessed by the extent to which the supporting evidence is applicable to the context specified in the review question; </li>
    <li>The coherence of each review finding, assessed by the extent to which the review finding was based on data that were similar across multiple individual studies and/or incorporated convincing explanations for any variations; </li>
    <li>The adequacy of data supporting the review finding, assessed by determining the degree of richness and/or scope, as well as the quantity of data supporting a review finding. </li>
</ul>
<p>An overall judgment of the confidence in each review finding was made, based on all of the above. Where existing systematic reviews were used, confidence assessments as reported in the original reviews were used. Assessing the confidence in each finding was not possible for the case study synthesis given that these findings were based on a wide range of evidence types.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contributors and Their Roles</span></strong></p>
<p>The work was coordinated by the Responsible Officer at the Department of Reproductive Health and Research. Within the World Health Organization (WHO), work on preventing unsafe abortion is housed solely within this Department, hence the WHO Steering Group comprised members of this Department, with additional representation from the Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and from WHO regional offices. Inputs were sought from other units at WHO as needed. The Steering Group managed the day-to-day activities of developing the guideline, developed the guideline questions, participated in the evidence retrieval and synthesis, and developed the Evidence to Decision (EtD) frameworks and draft recommendations. The Responsible Officer drafted the guideline with input from the Core Evidence Team and Steering Group. </p>
<p>The Core Evidence Team comprised experts from the Norwegian Knowledge Centre, Oslo. They provided oversight on methodological issues and the evidence retrieval and syntheses, and were responsible for the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) assessments of the certainty of evidence. They also worked with the Steering Group to draft the PICO questions and the EtD frameworks. Other experts provided technical input as needed. For example, an economist advised on resource use issues and an additional GRADE methodologist provided a second independent assessment of certainty. </p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprised 18 members (10 women, 8 men) and included diverse expertise but with a particular focus on health systems and on regions of the world where the need for task sharing in abortion care is a high priority. The GDG provided input into the development of the scope of the guideline and the formulation of the questions and in reviewing the evidence and making recommendations. They also reviewed and approved the final guideline. In addition to ongoing consultations via email, Skype and GoToMeeting, two in-person meetings with the GDG were held in Geneva (November 2013 and October 2014). </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scoping and Formulation of the Guideline Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>The initial list of tasks and health worker types to be considered for the guideline was developed on the basis of input and insights gained from previous technical consultations and regional meetings on safe abortion in Riga, Latvia (May 2012), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (September 2012), Kathmandu, Nepal (September 2012), and Nairobi, Kenya (November 2012). Additionally, an online questionnaire was sent to a purposively selected group of approximately 90 knowledgeable individuals to help define some of the relevant health worker categories, country-level practices and health worker roles. Responses were received from 35 people many of whom provided further input on national policies relating to health worker roles. The preliminary list was finalized in consultation with the GDG. </p>
<p><strong>Formulation of Questions</strong> </p>
<p>Agreed on questions on health worker&ndash;task combinations were formulated in PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) format. The prioritized outcomes were as follows: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Benefits and harms:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Safety: serious adverse events, complications (specific to the task); </li>
        <li>Effectiveness (specific to the task); </li>
        <li>Satisfaction of women receiving care with the overall services/health worker providing the care. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Acceptability:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Findings reported in qualitative research regarding the extent to which a task-shifting intervention is considered to be reasonable or adequate among women potentially or actually receiving abortion care, and among health workers potentially or actually delivering this care. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Feasibility:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Findings from qualitative studies on factors affecting implementation of task-shifting programmes at scale </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The specific operationalization of these concepts for each health worker&ndash;task combination can be found in the supplementary annexes (Web Supplement 2, Web Supplement 3 [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moving from Evidence to Recommendations</span></strong> </p>
<p>In order to follow a systematic process that explicitly considers the various factors that inform decisions on recommendations, the (EtD) frameworks developed by the Developing and Evaluating Communication Strategies to Support Informed Decision and Practice Based on Evidence (DECIDE) collaboration were used.</p>
<p>One framework was prepared for each question using a pre-set template. All systematically synthesized evidence as well as additional information was summarized into the following sections:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Background information:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>This section contains information about the PICO, the context and general information about the task. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Benefits and harms:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The section contains the Summary of Findings (SoF) tables on safety, effectiveness and satisfaction, a narrative description of the included studies, and relevant additional contextual information. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Acceptability:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>This section contains the summary of key findings from qualitative studies regarding the extent to which a task-shifting intervention is considered to be reasonable among women potentially or actually receiving abortion care and among health workers potentially or actually delivering this care. Acceptability to women was prioritized in decision-making; health worker acceptability informed implementation considerations. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Feasibility:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>This section contains the summary of key findings from qualitative research and from country case studies regarding the extent to which a task-shifting intervention is capable of being accomplished or implemented. The focus was on the feasibility of the intervention from a health system perspective, as well as on broader social, legal and political factors. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Resources:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>This section contains a summary of all resource-related outcomes reported within the studies that were selected for the safety and effectiveness evidence, and a qualitative assessment of resource needs in terms of training, supplies, referrals, supervision and monitoring, time and health worker remuneration. A health systems perspective was used in considering resource use, but especially for self-assessment and self-management approaches, resource use by women was also considered. </li>
        <li>No formal cost analysis was conducted as such analyses tend to be very context specific; nor was a systematic search and evaluation of resource use information undertaken. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Overall recommendations and decisions. </li>
    <li>Implementation considerations. </li>
    <li>Research needs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Using the framework, separate judgments were made for each of the criteria, i.e., the balance of benefits and harms, acceptability, feasibility and resource use. The overall recommendation considered all of these factors as relevant. This is particularly important as this guideline is related to health systems. The complete EtD frameworks are available in Web Supplement 1. </p>
<p><strong>Use of the Frameworks for Decision-making</strong></p>
<p>Draft EtD frameworks were prepared by the Steering Group and Core Evidence Team. These were reviewed by the GDG and recommendations finalized during the meeting in October 2014. In addition to the frameworks, the GDG also had access to all the evidence profiles and supplementary materials. </p>
<p>Decisions at the GDG meeting were consensus driven. The Chair allowed for discussion of differing views on recommendation options and the final decision was based on majority opinion, provided the panel members with opposing views were willing to agree to this outcome. An option for noting dissenting opinions was available, but it did not need to be used, nor did voting need to be resorted to. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Document Preparation</span></strong></p>
<p>The Responsible Officer at WHO worked with a consultant to write the draft guideline. </p></div>

Description of Implementation Strategy

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Implementation Considerations </span></strong></p>
<p>Implementation considerations specific to individual tasks have been highlighted along with the relevant recommendation in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>A complete discussion of the implementation considerations for safe abortion care is given in <em><a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70914/1/9789241548434_eng.pdf" title="World Health Organization (WHO) Web site">Safe abortion: technical and policy guidance for health systems</a></em> and in the <em><a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/97415/1/9789241548717_eng.pdf" title="WHO Web site">Clinical practice handbook for safe abortion</a></em>. Considerations for the implementation of contraceptive services can be found in <em><a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/102539/1/9789241506748_eng.pdf" title="WHO Web site">Ensuring human rights in the provision of contraceptive information and services</a></em>. A discussion of general considerations for task shifting in maternal health and family planning can be found in the <em>OptimizeMNH guideline</em> (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Findings from the qualitative reviews on acceptability and feasibility undertaken for this guideline also identified numerous facilitators and barriers to implementation; a complete summary of these findings is presented in Web Supplement 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </p>
<p>It is essential that task shifting and the overall expansion of health worker roles takes place as part of a planned and regulated strategy accompanied by appropriate mechanisms for training, certification and ongoing monitoring and support, and not as an opportunistic or de facto transfer of tasks because of the unavailability or the reluctance of a particular group of professionals to provide care. </p>
<p>Stakeholder involvement and working with professional associations across different levels of health worker groups is important in fostering trust, support for complementary roles and to create an enabling environment. The perceptions and attitudes of particular stakeholders can greatly influence the implementation of task shifting for abortion care. Addressing the concerns of more specialized providers who may be uncomfortable about shifting or sharing of tasks traditionally within their domain is important, as is addressing the concerns of health workers who will need to take on these additional roles. The latter may have legitimate concerns about workloads, remuneration and professional roles, and may also not always be supportive of or willing to be involved in providing abortion or post-abortion care or contraception. </p>
<p>Competency-based training is a key prerequisite in building confidence and preparing health workers for new roles. The learning curve required for a new skill to be fully acquired, and therefore the time lag needed for newly introduced interventions to reach optimum effectiveness, should not be underestimated. Over time, mechanisms to include the training in pre-service curricula are important to sustain task shifting at scale. </p>
<p>The training must address not only the specific tasks but also issues related to abortion and contraception more broadly, including an understanding of local laws. Training must aim to promote respectful care for women irrespective of the personal beliefs of individual health workers. Conscientious objection, where allowed, should be regulated, and provision of alternate care for the woman ensured. </p>
<p>Changes need to be developed in regulatory structures or mechanisms for health workers to access the necessary commodities and supplies within a health system setting. </p>
<p>Implicit in the implementation of these recommendations is the shift of services for early abortion care to the primary care level. Initial investments in strengthening the infrastructure to make that shift are likely to result in long-term gains. Self-management approaches and the involvement of pharmacists or lay health workers requires special attention to creating referral linkages (as these may not exist) and developing training materials and tools, and mechanisms for a supply of quality drugs within a regulated and monitored health systems context. </p>
<p>Ongoing supportive mentoring is needed as well. Health workers providing care related to abortion may face additional stigma or professional isolation in some contexts and mechanisms for support are therefore particularly important, especially for health workers involved with second trimester abortion care and those working in rural areas. </p>
<p>Ensuring retention of trained health workers in rural or underserved areas can be particularly challenging. This requires, among other things, giving professional and personal support, ensuring security for health workers and providing adequate remuneration and non-monetary rewards. The guideline <em><a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241564014_eng.pdf" title="WHO Web site">Increasing access to health workers in remote and rural areas through improved retention</a></em>, though not directly addressing the issue of abortion, contains relevant recommendations that may be useful when implementing the recommendations of this guideline. </p>
<p>Effective implementation requires a functioning health system. However, the need for being inclusive of a range of health-care providers can often be even more acute in contexts where health systems are dysfunctional or disrupted (e.g., in humanitarian or crisis settings) and task shifting for abortion and contraception-related care in such settings should not be overlooked.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Declarations of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>All members of the Guideline Development Group (GDG), the Core Evidence Team, peer reviewers and consultants were required to complete the standard World Health Organization (WHO) Declaration of Interest (DOI) form. GDG members completed the form prior to each of the meetings they attended and were also instructed to let the Secretariat know of any changes to their declared interests over time. The Steering Group evaluated the responses and discussed them with the Director of the Department. At the GDG meetings, the Chair presented a summary of the DOIs and all participants had the opportunity to confirm, append or amend any interests already declared.</p>
<p>Only two individuals &ndash; members of the GDG &ndash; declared secondary interests, which were not deemed to constitute a conflict of interest for the purpose of this guideline. No conflicts of financial interest or involvement with commercial entities were declared. The DOI forms have been electronically archived for future reference.</p>
<p>A complete list of all contributors, their affiliations, roles and DOIs is included in Annex A of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Dr Kristina Gemzell Danielsson reported that she has received funding for clinical trials on abortion from the Nordic Society for Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and the European Society for Contraception and Reproductive Health. Dr Beverley Winikoff reported that her activities are covered by a grant from an anonymous donor (non-profit foundation). The grant is for work on medical abortion internationally and the same donor also supports research work at the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research.</p></div>
