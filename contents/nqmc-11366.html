Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the facility-level rate of risk-standardized, all-cause, unplanned hospital visits within 7 days of an outpatient colonoscopy among Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients aged 65 years and older.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Colonoscopy is a common and costly procedure performed at outpatient facilities and is frequently performed among relatively healthy patients to screen for colorectal cancer. Given the widespread use of colonoscopy, understanding and minimizing procedure-related adverse events is a high priority. These adverse events, such as abdominal pain, bleeding, and intestinal perforation, can result in unanticipated hospital visits post procedure. Physicians performing colonoscopies are often unaware that patients seek acute care at hospitals following the procedure and thus underestimate such events. This risk-standardized quality measure will address this information gap and promote quality improvement by providing feedback to facilities and physicians, as well as transparency for patients on the rates of and variation across facilities in unplanned hospital visits after colonoscopy.</p>
<p>This measure will reduce adverse patient outcomes associated with preparation for colonoscopy, the procedure itself, and follow-up care by capturing and making more visible to providers and patients all unplanned hospital visits following the procedure. The measure score will assess quality and inform quality improvement.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Colonoscopy is a common and costly procedure. In 2002 alone, physicians performed an estimated 14 million colonoscopies in the United States (Seeff et al., 2004). The vast majority (90%) are done in the outpatient settings of hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs), ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), and physician offices (Russo et al., 2006). While colonoscopy is used for the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of conditions, most outpatient colonoscopies are for the screening of colorectal cancer (CRC) among relatively healthy patients. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2008) recommends CRC screening every 10 years for the general population aged 50 to 75 years and more frequently for individuals at higher risk. While many modalities are available for CRC screening, colonoscopy is the most widely used (Shapiro et al., 2012) and is recommended by professional organizations as the optimal screening method due to the ability to visualize the bowel and the capacity to remove precancerous lesions (polyps) detected on examination (Rex et al., 2009). Given the widespread use of colonoscopy in the outpatient setting, often among patients without a known illness, understanding and minimizing procedure-related adverse events is a high priority. </p>
<p>Colonoscopies are associated with a range of well described adverse events that lead to hospital visits, repeat procedures, or surgical intervention for treatment. The most severe adverse events reported after colonoscopy are colonic perforation; gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; and cardiopulmonary events such as hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia, and cardiac arrhythmias (Day et al., 2011; Ko &amp; Dominitz, 2010; ASGE Standards of Practice Committee et al., 2011). Furthermore, 20% to 34% of patients report a range of less severe adverse events such as abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and other non-specific symptoms post colonoscopy (Baudet et al., 2009; Ko et al., 2007). Yet clinicians performing colonoscopies underreport these clinical outcomes (Leffler et al., 2010), in part because they lack information about patients seeking follow-up care from other providers in settings such as a hospital ED. Hospital visits are generally unexpected after outpatient colonoscopy, yet reported hospital visit rates after outpatient colonoscopy range from 0.8% to 1% at 7 to 14 days and 2.4% to 3.8% at 30 days post procedure (Ko et al., 2007; Leffler et al., 2010; Chukmaitov et al., 2008).</p>
<p>Both patients and providers will benefit from outcome measures that capture the full range of adverse experiences associated with outpatient colonoscopy and illuminate quality differences. Currently, there are no publicly available quality reports on outcomes among providers or facilities that conduct outpatient colonoscopies. Thus, there is an opportunity to enhance the information available to patients choosing among providers who offer this elective procedure. Further, providing outcome rates to providers will make visible to clinicians meaningful quality differences and incentivize improvement.</p></div>

Admissions identified as planned by the planned admission algorithm are not counted in the outcome. The "algorithm" is a set of criteria for classifying admissions as planned using Medicare claims. The algorithm identifies admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 7 days of an outpatient colonoscopy. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) based the planned admission algorithm on three principles: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>The measure's approach to risk adjustment is tailored to, and appropriate for, a publicly reported outcome measure as articulated in published scientific guidelines. </p>
<p>The measure uses a two-level hierarchical logistic regression model to estimate facility-level risk-standardized hospital visit rates. This approach accounts for the clustering of patients within facilities and variation in sample size across facilities. </p>
<p>The risk-standardization model has 15 patient-level variables (age, concomitant upper gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy, polypectomy during the procedure, and 12 comorbidity variables). The measure defines comorbidity variables using condition categories (CCs), which are clinically meaningful groupings of the many thousands of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes. Certain CCs are considered possible complications of care; therefore, the measure does not risk-adjust for them if they occur only at the time of the procedure. This is because only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at the time of the procedure or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arose during the colonoscopy procedure are included in the risk adjustment. The <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier3&amp;cid=1228775197506" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 Measure Updates and Specifications Report: Facility 7-day Risk-standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy</a></em> contains complete definitions of risk factors and CCs that are considered possible complications of care and are not risk-adjusted for if they occur only at the time of the procedure (see also the "Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The patient-level risk-adjustment variables are:</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: The relationship between age and risk of a hospital visit within 7 days was modified by the presence or absence of a cardiac arrhythmia (p-value for interaction less than 0.001). Therefore, the developer included an interaction term (age categorized x arrhythmia) in the final model.</p>
