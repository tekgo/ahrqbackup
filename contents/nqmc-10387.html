<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This indicator is intended to flag cases of pressure ulcer that arise during a hospital stay. Acutely ill and immobilized neonates and children are at risk for pressure ulcer (PU) development. PUs cause considerable harm to patients and may lead to increased hospital costs and length of stay. PUs may predispose the patient to infection, sepsis, and treatment that may require surgical intervention. Occipital PUs may cause permanent alopecia, embarrassment, and body image disturbances (McCord et al., 2004). Over 82% of the PU events in adults are thought to preventable (Baharestani &amp; Ratliff, 2011). Given the anatomical and physiological differences between adults and children, the number of preventable events in children and neonates may differ, as suggested by the relatively large number of events (49% of true positive events) in one study that were categorized by pediatric practitioners as not clearly preventable (Scanlon et al., 2008). However, stakeholder groups such as the Pediatric Affinity Group (n.d.) (American Academy of Pediatrics, Child Health Corporation of America, National Association of Children's Hospital and Related Institutions, and National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality) agree that the goal should be to eliminate PU in the pediatric population and that PU in pediatric patients should and can be prevented.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Using data from 19 states from 2006 to 2008, with over five million pediatric hospitalizations, HealthGrades (Reed &amp; May, 2010) reported that pediatric patients who experienced this event had 6.15% mortality and a total excess cost of $1.3 billion. In a study utilizing data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) from 2000 to 2007, Friedman et al. (2011) reported a 34.5% increase in pressure ulcer (PU) rates from 2000 to 2007. It is unclear whether this increase is due to improved reporting or increasing prevalence during pediatric hospitalizations. The authors cautioned that "present on admission data" were not used and the sample of hospitals varied over the years. </p>
<p>However, similar results were reported from an earlier study by Sedman and colleagues (2005), using the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions aggregate Case Mix Comparative Database for 1999 to 2002, with 1.92 million discharges from 31 states (50 hospitals in 1999, increasing to 67 in 2002). In this study, PU rates increased each year from 4.14 per 1000 discharges in 1999 to 4.33 per 1000 discharges in 2002. Pressure ulcers were noted frequently for children with poor perfusion (i.e., those undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or requiring adrenergic agents to support blood pressure, with resultant poor skin perfusion). </p>
<p>In a case control study using nearest-neighbor propensity score matching, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) pediatric-specific Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) were used to identify adverse events in 431,524 discharges from 38 freestanding, academic, not-for-profit pediatric hospitals affiliated with the Child Health Corporation of American and participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database in 2006. They reported a PU rate of 4.52 per 1,000 discharges, which is similar to the AHRQ reported rate of 4.33 per 1,000 discharges for the same year. Records with a PU event had mean excess length of stay of 8.07 days and mean excess hospital charges of $59,225, relative to matched controls. The excess charges came from all hospital cost centers, including pharmacy ($10,959), supplies ($4,663), laboratory ($7,276), imaging ($1,284), and other clinical activities ($11,345). </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Includes approximately 6 million pediatric discharges for 2,500 hospitals (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [HCUP] State Inpatient Databases [SID]," 2008). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. The signal to noise ratio is the ratio of the between hospital variance (signal) to the within hospital variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). The ratio itself is only a diagnostic for the degree of variance in the risk-adjusted rate systematically associated with the provider. Therefore, what matters is the magnitude of the variance in the "smoothed" rate (that is, the variance in the risk-adjusted rate after the application of the univariate shrinkage estimator based on the signal ratio). </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. What the data demonstrate is systematic variation in the provider level rate of 0.647 to 3.222 per 1,000 from the 5th to 95th percentile after a signal ratio of 0.324 is applied as the shrinkage estimator (that is, after accounting for variation due to random factors). </p>
<p>California data from 2005 to 2007, which included "present on admission" (POA) reporting, were used to determine the percentage of hospitals with patient volumes sufficient to readily use the Quality Indicator (QI) for tracking performance over time. The unadjusted event rate was 3.1 per 1,000 when POA cases were not excluded and 1.4 per 1,000 when POA information was used, as in current AHRQ software. Only 4 of 353 California hospitals (1.1%), with 24% of the eligible discharges statewide, had sufficient patient volume to detect a hypothetical doubling of the Pediatric Quality Indicator (PDI) 01 rate. This problem could be minimized by focusing public reporting of this indicator on hospitals that meet a minimum pediatric volume threshold, or by incorporating it into a more robust composite measure (Bardach, Chien, &amp; Dudley, 2010).</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. The most recent study of the criterion validity of PDI 02 was based on a consecutive sample of 254 flagged cases from 28 participating hospitals in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions (NACHRI) from 2003 through 2005 (Scanlon et al., 2008). Records were reviewed independently by clinicians at each site, who lacked formal training but were guided by teleconference discussions. A previous review of 118 flagged cases from 14 self-selected children's hospitals in the NACHRI Pediatric Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) Collaborative (Scanlon et al., 2006) used similar methods.</p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Forty-four distinct professional clinical organizations and hospital associations were invited to submit nominations. These organizations were selected based on the applicability of the specialty or subspecialty to the candidate quality indicators. Refer to the original measure documentation for additional information on panel selection.</p>
<p>Four panels were formed to evaluate indicators grouped as follows: Medical and surgical indicators, surgical only indicators, neonatal indicators and prevention indicators. All panels had diversity in the geographic location of panelists, and their type of practice. </p>
<p>Criterion validity is analyzed by calculating positive predictive value (PPV), which is defined as the percentage of reported events that are confirmed as true events based upon application of a "criterion (gold) standard." In the cited studies, the criterion standard was based on review of randomly or chronologically sampled medical records by an experienced clinician, using a standard data collection tool and guidelines. </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. Face validity was systematically assessed using an expert panel process, as described in original submission documents (McDonald et al., 2006). Specifically, this indicator was reviewed by a pediatric specialty panel with ten pediatric clinicians, including one neonatologist, one infectious disease specialist, one ambulatory care pediatrician, one hospitalist, one cardiovascular surgeon, one oncologist, two surgeons, one interventional radiologist, and one critical care physician. Median ratings were 7 (on a scale of 1 to 9) with indeterminate agreement on usefulness for internal quality improvement, 7 with indeterminate agreement for comparative reporting, and 7 with indeterminate agreement for preventability. Interestingly, the expert panel felt that the indicator was most useful when tracking high risk populations, including patients with hemiplegia, paraplegia, quadriplegia (e.g., due to cerebral palsy), spina bifida, muscular dystrophies, and neurologic impairment due to trauma. Panelists also noted that "skin breakdown" or "sores" in newborns rarely stem from gravity alone, but rather from friction from equipment and other processes. These sores may not be identified as decubiti, so they are likely to be coded differently. For this reason, newborns were excluded from the PDI 02 denominator. </p>
<p>Studies targeting the validity of administrative data to measure hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU) in the pediatric population are limited. The larger, more recent study published in 2008 estimated a PPV of 54%, which is substantially higher than the PPV estimates for the adult version of this indicator (e.g., 30% [95% confidence interval (CI), 22% to 40%] and 26% [95% CI, 22% to 30%] for PSI 03). Fewer details are reported from the earlier (2006) study, but Table 1 in that paper suggests a PPV of at least 54% to 64%. The great majority of false positives were due to ulcers that were actually present on admission (i.e., 93 of 116 false positives in the NACHRI study), which would automatically be excluded by users with POA data. Adjusting for the availability of POA data, the estimated PPV in the 2008 NACHRI study was 86%. The remaining false positives were largely attributable to confusion over skin irritation or breakdown, due to friction or tape, versus pressure-related injury. Coding variation was especially notable in small infants, who have since been excluded from the PDI 02 denominator. </p>
<p>No data about the sensitivity of PDI 02 are available at this time, although the limited data available for PSI 03 suggests a need for further study. </p>

The reference population used in the regression is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Data (SID) for the year 2008, a database consisting of 43 states and approximately 6 million pediatric discharges. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., hospital). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population rate. </p>
