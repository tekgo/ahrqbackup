Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess adult in-center hemodialysis patients' perceptions of their experiences with in-center dialysis care. Patients rate their dialysis center on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst dialysis center possible and 10 is the best dialysis center possible. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a particularly complex condition: patients require either dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive, and typically have comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, high levels of cognitive impairment, and low levels of literacy. </p>
<p>As a result of legislation passed in 1972, Medicare pays for more than two-thirds of the expenditures for care for patients with ESRD. In 2000, the U.S. Office of the Inspector General recommended developing a standardized experience of care survey of patients with ESRD in order to provide valid comparative information to the public. MedPac's Report to Congress in 2003 also reiterated the need to evaluate ESRD patient satisfaction. In response to these recommendations and to ensure quality of care for dialysis patients, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) decided to work with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to develop a survey that could be used both for internal quality improvement at the facility level and for public reporting to patients and caregivers. CMS has been reporting comparative clinical information at the facility level since January of 2001 on its <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/dialysisfacilitycompare/#search" title="Dialysis Facility Compare Web site" target="_blank'">Dialysis Facility Compare Web site</a>.</p>
<p>The In-Center Hemodialysis CAHPS Survey asks adults with ESRD about their experiences with care from dialysis facilities. Both dialysis facilities and End-Stage Renal Disease Networks (known simply as Networks) can use this tool to measure and improve the patient-centeredness of their care.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The development of this CAHPS survey involved several steps, including a review of existing surveys, a scientific assessment of potential items, public input, cognitive testing, and field testing, which includes psychometric analyses of the performance of items and their domains. All of these steps contributed to the drafting of the questionnaire and subsequent revisions.</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive Testing</strong></p>
<p>In early spring of 2004, the instrument underwent an initial round of cognitive testing with a total of 30 dialysis patients. The team used the cognitive testing findings along with the public comments the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) received as the basis for revisions to the draft. </p>
<p>A second round of cognitive testing was conducted in May and June of 2004. The survey was further revised, then translated into Spanish, and prepared for a third round of cognitive testing with Spanish-speaking dialysis patients, completed in September 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot Testing</strong></p>
<p>The CAHPS grantees conducted a pilot test during the winter of 2004-2005 with a representative sample of 32 facilities that varied with respect to region, size of facility, rural/urban location, hospital affiliation, and tax status. A sample size of 3,143 patients was used. The final number of respondents was 1,454, with an overall response rate of 46%: 56% responded by telephone, while 44% responded by mail.</p>
<p>The purpose of the pilot test was to examine the reliability and validity of the draft survey questions, identify those questions most robust for public reporting and those most appropriate for internal quality improvement, and evaluate different data collection strategies. Specifically, researchers involved in the pilot did the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evaluated the psychometric properties of the questions with the aim of reducing the number of items in the final survey; </li>
    <li>Tested two modes of administration (telephone; mail with telephone follow-up); </li>
    <li>Examined the need for assistance in completing the survey; </li>
    <li>Tracked the involvement of facilities in promoting the survey; and </li>
    <li>Evaluated the use of Spanish interpreters. </li>
</ul>
<p>The field test showed that the vast majority of items on the survey performed well in the field; based on psychometric criteria, only four items were recommended for deletion. The final instrument reflects these recommendations.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The survey results are statistically adjusted for mode, nonresponse, and patient mix.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustment of Results</strong> </p>
<p>In early 2014, the In-Center Hemodialysis (ICH) CAHPS Coordination Team conducted a mode experiment to test the effects of using three data collection modes: mail only, telephone only, and mixed mode (mail with telephone follow-up of nonrespondents). </p>
<p>Because some patients' assessment of the care they received from ICH facilities may be influenced by patient characteristics that are beyond the ICH facilities' control, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) used data from the mode experiment to determine whether and to what extent characteristics of patients participating in the ICH CAHPS Survey statistically affect survey results. Statistical models were developed to adjust or control for these patient characteristics when survey results are publicly reported. Also, some patients might not respond to the survey, and this might affect the accuracy and comparability of results. Therefore, the data from the mode experiment were analyzed to detect potential nonresponse bias. The Coordination Team uses results of these analyses to apply statistical adjustments that need to be made on each semiannual submission of the ICH CAHPS Survey data during the national implementation.</p>
<p>The results of the analysis of data from the ICH CAHPS Survey Mode Experiment showed significant differences in patients' ratings and assessment of their hemodialysis care based on survey mode and in responses to the survey items that are attributable to patient mix characteristics. A total of 13 patient mix characteristics and survey mode were found to be statistically significant in at least one of the regression models. The 14 adjusters (13 patient characteristics plus survey mode) include the following: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Mode of survey administration </li>
    <li>Overall health </li>
    <li>Overall mental health </li>
    <li>Heart disease </li>
    <li>Deaf or serious difficulty hearing </li>
    <li>Blind or serious difficulty seeing </li>
    <li>Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions </li>
    <li>Difficulty dressing or bathing </li>
    <li>Age </li>
    <li>Sex </li>
    <li>Education </li>
    <li>Does the patient speak a language other than English at home </li>
    <li>Did someone help the patient complete this survey </li>
    <li>Total number of years on dialysis </li>
</ul>
<p>During each ICH CAHPS public reporting period, CMS and its Coordination Team will use data from the two most recent semiannual ICH CAHPS Surveys to derive the 13 patient mix adjustment factors using coefficients obtained from Ordinary Least Squares regression models for the top- and bottom-box scores for each of the three global ratings and the three composite measures.</p>
