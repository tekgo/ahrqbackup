<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure uses survey data to assess the percentage of members 18 to 64 years of age who received an influenza vaccination between July 1 of the measurement year and the date when the CAHPS 5.0H Adult Survey was completed.</p>
<p>This measure is collected as part of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version (commercial, Medicaid).</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The disease burden of influenza is large, and the potential for prevention is high. Influenza infections result in significant health care expenditures each year, and the vaccine is safe and effective. Specifications are consistent with current recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). This group has an increased prevalence of people with high-risk medical conditions, and age-specific strategies have been more successful to increase vaccine coverage than those based on medical conditions.</p>
<p>Healthy adults in this age group without high-risk conditions will benefit by reduced number of illnesses, physician visits, missed workdays and antibiotic use, and will have reduced disease transmission from contacts who are at high-risk for influenza-related complications.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Influenza (flu) is a common and contagious respiratory illness caused by a set of viruses that can result in serious complications or death&nbsp;(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). The flu vaccine is recommended for all adults; vaccinations can reduce flu-related hospitalizations by 71 percent (Flu.gov, n.d.; Talbot et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>In 2010 there were 25 million cases of influenza in the United States (8.1 percent of the total population). The annual economic costs are $29.12 billion (Mao et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Although complications from the flu are more likely to take place in the elderly population, adults of all ages are at risk. In 2013, more than 60 percent of hospitalizations occurred in adults between the ages of 18 to 64 years (Talbot et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>The best protection against flu is to get the annual flu vaccine. Vaccination can prevent many hospitalizations, save thousands of lives and contribute to significant cost savings. </li>
</ul>
