<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common condition affecting women of reproductive age that has significant social and economic impact. <strong>(II-2)</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Contemporary terminology used to describe AUB in reproductive-aged women aims to simplify definitions and to provide standard descriptions related to patient presentation. <strong>(III)</strong> </li>
    <li>The consequences of AUB on an individual's overall health determines the degree to which intervention may be required. <strong>(II-2)</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>

<p><strong>History, Physical Examination and Laboratory Investigations</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A thorough history and physical examination will often indicate the cause of AUB and direct the need for further investigation and treatment. <strong>(III)</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li>A complete blood count is recommended for women with heavy or prolonged bleeding. <strong>(II-2A)</strong> </li>
    <li>If there is any possibility of pregnancy, a sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test should be performed. <strong>(III-C)</strong> </li>
    <li>Testing for coagulation disorders should be considered only in women who have a history of heavy menstrual bleeding beginning at menarche or who have a personal or family history of abnormal bleeding. <strong>(II-2B)</strong> </li>
    <li>Thyroid function tests are not indicated unless there are clinical findings suggestive of an index of suspicions of thyroid disease. <strong>(II-2D)</strong> </li>

<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="11">
    <li>Non-hormonal options such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antifibrinolytics can be used effectively to treat heavy menstrual bleeding that is mainly cyclic or predictable in timing. <strong>(I-A)</strong> </li>
    <li>Combined oral contraceptive pills, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUS) significantly reduce menstrual bleeding and should be used to treat women with abnormal uterine bleeding who desire effective contraception. <strong>(I-A)</strong> </li>
    <li>Cyclic luteal-phase progestins do not effectively reduce blood loss and therefore should not be used as a specific treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. <strong>(I-E)</strong> </li>
    <li>Danazol and GnRH agonists will effectively reduce menstrual bleeding, and may be used for scenarios in which other medical or surgical treatments have failed or are contraindicated. <strong>(I-C)</strong> </li>
    <li>Patients receiving a GnRH agonist for longer than 6 months should be prescribed add-back hormone therapy, if not already initiated with GnRH agonist commencement. <strong>(I-A)</strong> </li>

    <li>Women with inherited bleeding disorders who have significant heavy menstrual bleeding or those who fail conventional medical therapy are best managed with a multidisciplinary approach. <strong>(III-C)</strong> </li>
