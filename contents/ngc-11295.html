<p><strong>Translation of Class of Evidence to Recommendation Levels</strong></p>
<p>Based on the strength of evidence grading for each critical question (see the Evidentiary Table in the original guideline document), the subcommittee drafted the recommendations and the supporting text synthesizing the evidence using the following guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Level A recommendations</strong>. Generally accepted principles for patient care that reﬂect a high degree of clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level B recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reﬂect moderate clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level C recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances in which consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Classes of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Two methodologists independently graded and assigned a preliminary Class of Evidence for all articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy. Class of Evidence is delineated whereby an article with design 1 represents the strongest study design and subsequent design classes (i.e., design 2 and design 3) represent respectively weaker study designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic studies, or meta-analyses (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles are then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, such as randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, sample size, generalizability, data management, analyses, congruence of results and conclusions, and conflicts of interest. Using a predetermined process combining the study's design, methodological quality, and applicability to the critical question, articles received a Class of Evidence grade. An adjudication process involving discussion with the original methodologist graders and at least one additional methodologist was then used to address any discordance in original grading, resulting in a final Class of Evidence assignment (i.e., Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles identified with fatal flaws or ultimately determined to not be applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade "X" and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. However, content in these articles may have been used to formulate the background and to inform expert consensus in the absence of robust evidence. Grading was done with respect to the specific critical questions; thus, the Class of Evidence for any one study may vary according to the question for which it is being considered. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive a different Class of Evidence rating when addressing a different critical question. Question-specific Classes of Evidence grading may be found in the Evidentiary Table in the original guideline document.</p></div>

Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reﬂect moderate clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level C recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances in which consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Review comments were received from emergency physicians, cardiologists, individual members of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association, a patient representative, and members of American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP's) Medical-Legal Committee. Comments were received during a 60-day open-comment period, with notices of the comment period sent in an e-mail to ACEP members, published in <em>EM Today</em>, and posted on the ACEP Web site. The responses were used to further refine and enhance this clinical policy; however, responses do not imply endorsement.</p>
<p>This clinical policy was approved by the ACEP Board of Directors on June 28, 2017.</p>
<p>This guideline was endorsed by the Emergency Nurses Association on August 22, 2017.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The use of fibrinolytics when door-to-balloon (D2B) time is delayed may result in better long-term outcomes with a decrease in major adverse cardiac events (MACE). </li>
    <li>Patients who receive timely percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may experience better outcomes with a decrease in MACE. </li>
    <li>Opioids offer relief to chest pain patients by reducing discomfort and helping them relax during a highly stressful medical event. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Time estimates are challenging to obtain in the context of an emergency, therefore patients may not receive the recommended therapy within the appropriate time frame necessary to achieve optimal outcomes. </li>
    <li>Patients may decompensate en route to the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) facility resulting in poor outcomes. </li>
    <li>Opioids can potentially result in less salvageable myocardium if administered to patients having a myocardial infarction (MI). </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of <em>Annals of Emergency Medicine</em> and its editors. </li>
    <li>This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. </li>
    <li>It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain adequate empirical data to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. </li>
    <li>This clinical policy is not intended to represent a legal standard of care for emergency physicians. Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic or management options available to the emergency physician. ACEP recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment and patient preferences. This guideline provides clinical strategies for which medical literature exists to answer the critical questions addressed in this policy. </li>
