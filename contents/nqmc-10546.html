Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children 3 months to 18 years of age who were given a diagnosis of upper respiratory infection (URI) and were not dispensed an antibiotic prescription on or three days after the Index Episode Start Date (IESD).</p>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The common cold (or upper respiratory infection [URI]) is a frequent reason for children visiting the doctor's office. Though existing clinical guidelines do not support the use of antibiotics for the common cold, physicians often prescribe them for this ailment (Rosenstein et al., 1998). Pediatric clinical practice guidelines (Rosenstein et al., 1998) do not recommend antibiotics for a majority of upper respiratory tract infections because of the viral etiology of these infections, including the common cold. A performance measure of antibiotic use for URI sheds light on the prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in clinical practice and raises awareness of the importance of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use to combat antibiotic resistance in the community.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Most upper respiratory infections (URIs), also known as the common cold, are caused by viruses that require no antibiotic treatment. Too often, antibiotics are prescribed inappropriately, which can lead to antibiotic resistance (when antibiotics can no longer cure bacterial infections). Antibiotic resistance is a major health concern in the United States and around the world (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). </li>
    <li>Children average more than two to three colds each year&mdash;colds are the main reason they miss school (CDC, 2014). </li>
    <li>The total economic impact of treating URIs is close to $17 billion per year in direct costs (Fendrick et al., 2003). </li>
    <li>Pediatric ambulatory visits to physicians account for nearly 50 million antibiotic prescriptions annually in the United States (Hersh et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>Recent efforts to decrease unnecessary prescribing have resulted in fewer children receiving antibiotics in recent years, but inappropriate use remains a problem (CDC, 2013). Increased education and awareness of appropriate treatment for URIs can reduce the danger of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. </li>
</ul>
