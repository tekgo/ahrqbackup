Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level risk-standardized payment (RSP) for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) episode of care starting with inpatient admission to a short term acute-care hospital and extending 30 days post-admission for Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) patients discharged from the hospital with a principal discharge diagnosis of AMI.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Medicare spending is estimated to have been $525.0 billion in 2010 with annual growth rates projected to be 6.3% for 2013 through 2020 due to both an increase in the Medicare population as well as Medicare spending on each beneficiary (Ash &amp; Byrne-Logan, 1998). Further projections anticipate an exhaustion of Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Part A) by 2024 (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission [MedPAC], 2012). The growth in spending is unsustainable and highlights the need to understand the value of care Medicare buys with every dollar spent. </p>
<p>Given the urgency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the fact that Medicare pays for 40% to 50% of hospitalizations nationally (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012), hospital costs are a natural venue in which to deconstruct payments for Medicare patients. Yet payments to hospitals are difficult to interpret in isolation. Some high-payment hospitals may have better clinical outcomes when compared with low-payment hospitals; other-high payment hospitals may not. For this reason, the value of hospital care is more clearly assessed when pairing hospital payments with hospital quality. </p>
<p>A measure of payments for Medicare patients to hospitals that is aligned with current quality of care measures will facilitate profiling hospital value (payments and quality). The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) developed a measure of payments for Medicare patients that reflects differences in the management of care for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) both during hospitalization and immediately post-discharge. AMI is a condition with substantial variation in costs of care and for which there are well-established publicly reported quality measures, and is therefore an ideal condition for assessing relative value for an episode of care that begins with an acute hospitalization. By focusing on one specific condition, value assessments may provide actionable feedback to hospitals and incentivize targeted improvements in care.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common condition in the elderly with substantial variability in payments due to different practice patterns. Quality measures for AMI such as 30-day AMI risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) are already publicly reported. In the context of its publicly reported quality measures, AMI is an ideal condition in which to assess payments for Medicare patients and relative hospital value. Therefore, we created a measure of payments for a 30-day episode of care for AMI that could be aligned with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid's (CMS's) 30-day AMI mortality and readmission measures. This will allow CMS to assess the value of care provided for these episodes.</p>
<p>A preliminary examination of the 30-day AMI risk-standardized mortality and risk-standardized payment measures showed high quality care (as measured by RSMR) at higher and lower relative costs. This finding illustrated that quality care can be provided at relative lower costs and that efficiencies of care can be optimized for AMI. </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models </strong></p>
<p>The acute myocardial infarction (AMI) payment measure estimates hospital-specific episode-of-care risk-standardized payment (RSPs) using a hierarchical generalized linear model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the AMI model using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year.</p>
<p>CMS assessed generalized linear model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. Two summary statistics for assessing model performance were computed: the predictive ratio and a quasi-R&sup2;. For a traditional linear model (that is, ordinary least squares regression), R&sup2; is interpreted as the amount of variation in the observed outcome that is explained by the predictor variables (patient-level risk factors). Generalized linear models, however, do not output an R&sup2; that is akin to the R&sup2; of a traditional linear model. A "quasi-R&sup2;" was produced by regressing the total payment outcome on the predicted outcome. Specifically, CMS regressed the total payment on the payment predicted by the patient-level risk factors.</p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.2 of the original measure documentation. </p>
<p><strong>AMI Payment 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of AMI Model Variables </em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. There were no notable changes (greater than 2% absolute change) in the frequencies. </p>
<p><em>AMI Model Parameters and Performance </em></p>
<p>Table 4.2.2 in the original measure documentation shows the hierarchical generalized linear regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.2.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted payment ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the AMI payment model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. The quasi-R&sup2; for the AMI payment model was 0.08, suggesting that approximately 8% of the variation in payment can be explained by patient-level risk factors. This quasi-R&sup2; is in line with R&sup2;s from other patient-level risk-adjustment models for healthcare payment (Pope et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the quasi-R&sup2; and predictive ratios remained similar to the model used for 2016 public reporting.</p>
<p>Refer to the original measure documentation for additional information. </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables </strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid disease, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission. </p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment. </p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of healthcare that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important payment differences. As part of the National Quality Forum's (NQF's) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although bivariate analyses found that the average total payments is higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the quasi-R&sup2; values for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables. </p>
