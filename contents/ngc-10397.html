Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate and Low</strong>), and the strength of recommendation (<strong>Grade A-E, N</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 1</span></strong></p>
<p>In the general population aged 60 years or older, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or higher and treat to a goal SBP lower than 150 mm Hg and goal DBP lower than 90 mm Hg.</p>
<p><em>Strong Recommendation &ndash; Grade A</em></p>
<p><strong>Corollary Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>In the general population aged 60 years or older, if pharmacologic treatment for high BP results in lower achieved SBP (for example, &lt;140 mm Hg) and treatment is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life, treatment does not need to be adjusted.</p>
<p><em>Expert Opinion &ndash; Grade E</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 2</span></strong></p>
<p>In the general population younger than 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher and treat to a goal DBP of lower than 90 mm Hg.</p>
<p><em>For ages 30 through 59 years, Strong Recommendation &ndash; Grade A</em></p>
<p><em>For ages 18 through 29 years, Expert Opinion &ndash; Grade E</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 3</span></strong></p>
<p>In the general population younger than 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher and treat to a goal SBP of lower than 140 mm Hg.</p>
<p><em>Expert Opinion &ndash; Grade E</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 4</span></strong></p>
<p>In the population aged 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease (CKD), initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher or DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher and treat to goal SBP of lower than 140 mm Hg and goal DBP lower than 90 mm Hg.</p>
<p><em>Expert Opinion &ndash; Grade E</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 5</span></strong></p>
<p>In the population aged 18 years or older with diabetes, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher or DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher and treat to a goal SBP of lower than 140 mm Hg and goal DBP lower than 90 mm Hg.</p>
<p><em>Expert Opinion &ndash; Grade E</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 6</span></strong></p>
<p>In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).</p>
<p><em>Moderate Recommendation &ndash; Grade B</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 7</span></strong></p>
<p>In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB.</p>
<p><em>For general black population: Moderate Recommendation &ndash; Grade B</em></p>
<p><em>For black patients with diabetes: Weak Recommendation &ndash; Grade C</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 8</span></strong></p>
<p>In the population aged 18 years or older with CKD and hypertension, initial (or add-on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. This applies to all CKD patients with hypertension regardless of race or diabetes status.</p>
<p><em>Moderate Recommendation &ndash; Grade B</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 9</span></strong></p>
<p>The main objective of hypertension treatment is to attain and maintain goal BP. If goal BP is not reached within a month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug from one of the classes in recommendation 6 (thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB). The clinician should continue to assess BP and adjust the treatment regimen until goal BP is reached. If goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug from the list provided. Do not use an ACEI and an ARB together in the same patient. If goal BP cannot be reached using the drugs in recommendation 6 because of a contraindication or the need to use more than 3 drugs to reach goal BP, antihypertensive drugs from other classes can be used. Referral to a hypertension specialist may be indicated for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained using the above strategy or for the management of complicated patients for whom additional clinical consultation is needed.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>Initial search dates for the literature review were January 1, 1966, through December 31, 2009. The search strategy and PRISMA diagram for each question is in the online Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). To ensure that no major relevant studies published after December 31, 2009, were excluded from consideration, 2 independent searches of PubMed and CINAHL between December 2009 and August 2013 were conducted with the same MeSH terms as the original search. Three panel members reviewed the results. The panel limited the inclusion criteria of this second search to the following. (1) The study was a major study in hypertension (e.g., ACCORD-BP, SPS3; however, SPS3 did not meet strict inclusion criteria because it included non-hypertensive participants. SPS3 would not have changed our conclusions/recommendations because the only significant finding supporting a lower goal for BP occurred in an infrequent secondary outcome). (2) The study had at least 2000 participants. (3) The study was multi centered. (4) The study met all the other inclusion/exclusion criteria. The relatively high threshold of 2000 participants was used because of the markedly lower event rates observed in recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) such as ACCORD, suggesting that larger study populations are needed to obtain interpretable results. Additionally, all panel members were asked to identify newly published studies for consideration if they met the above criteria. No additional clinical trials met the previously described inclusion criteria. Studies selected were rated for quality using National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) standardized quality rating tool and were only included if rated as good or fair.</p>
<p>Detailed search strategy for each question is provided in the appendix of the Supplement document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee 8 (JNC 8) were selected from over 400 nominees. Panel members were selected based on their expertise in hypertension, primary care, including geriatrics, cardiology, nephrology, nursing, pharmacology, clinical trials, evidence‐based medicine, epidemiology, informatics and the development and implementation of clinical guidelines in systems of care.</p>
<p>The panel also included a senior scientist from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), a senior medical officer from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and a senior scientist from NHLBI, who withdrew from authorship prior to publication. In assembling the panel, the JNC sought to achieve a balance of expertise and perspectives. The panel met for the first time in September 2008.</p>
<p>Once all evidence statements for each critical question were identified, the panel reviewed the evidence statements to craft the clinical recommendations, voting on each recommendation and on the strength of the recommendation (see Table 3 in the evidence review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). For both evidence statements and recommendations, a record of the vote count (for, against, or recusal) was made without attribution. The panel attempted to achieve 100% consensus whenever possible, but a two-thirds majority was considered acceptable, with the exception of recommendations based on expert opinion, which required a 75% majority agreement to approve.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In January 2013, the guideline was submitted for external peer review by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to 20 reviewers, all of whom had expertise in hypertension, and to 16 federal agencies. Reviewers also had expertise in cardiology, nephrology, primary care, pharmacology, research (including clinical trials), biostatistics, and other important related fields. Sixteen individual reviewers and 5 federal agencies responded. Reviewers' comments were collected, collated, and anonymized. Comments were reviewed and discussed by the panel from March through June 2013 and incorporated into a revised document. (Reviewers' comments and suggestions, and responses and disposition by the panel are available on request from the authors.)</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure (BP) in adults is not a comprehensive guideline and is limited in scope because of the focused evidence review to address the 3 specific questions (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Clinicians often provide care for patients with numerous comorbidities or other important issues related to hypertension, but the decision was made to focus on 3 questions considered to be relevant to most physicians and patients. Treatment adherence and medication costs were thought to be beyond the scope of this review, but the panel acknowledges the importance of both issues. </li>
    <li>The recommendations from this evidence-based guideline from panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) offer clinicians an analysis of what is known and not known about BP treatment thresholds, goals, and drug treatment strategies to achieve those goals based on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient. </li>
    <li>The views expressed do not represent those of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Institutes of Health, or the federal government. </li>
