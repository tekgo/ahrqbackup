<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Use of consistent criteria to determine appropriateness for postpartum mother transport accompaniment </li>
    <li>Use of standardized process to evaluate the physical and mental capabilities of the mother and context for safe postpartum accompaniment </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>While most of the parents expressed they preferred to accompany the child on transport, transport personnel articulated concerns related to parent accompaniment such as interference in the care of the child, gaining the child's cooperation in the parent's presence, and parental apprehension when observing care interventions. </li>
    <li>It was noted through informal dialogue with other pediatric transport providers across the country that they also allowed transport team members to decide the appropriateness of each postpartum accompaniment. Individual decision making may be biased by personal opinion or convenience, resulting in unnecessary variation, rather than solely evaluated on the mothers physical and mental status. </li>

Qualifying Statements

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This Best Evidence Statement addresses only key points of care for the target population; it is not intended to be a comprehensive practice guideline. These recommendations result from review of literature and practices current at the time of their formulation. This Best Evidence Statement does not preclude using care modalities proven efficacious in studies published subsequent to the current revision of this document. This document is not intended to impose standards of care preventing selective variances from the recommendations to meet the specific and unique requirements of individual patients. Adherence to this Statement is voluntary. The clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient must make the ultimate judgment regarding the priority of any specific procedure.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Applicability Issues</strong></p>
<p>Since there is no recommendation, the plan to address the question is to conduct a research survey of Neonatal/Pediatric Transport Teams nationally in order to determine current beliefs and practice. Survey questions will include whether or not site transport personnel: feel that parents should be allowed to accompany the child on transport, vary their practice in relation to the age of the child, foresee any parent related problems on accompaniment, have experienced safety situations during parent accompaniment, routinely discourage parent accompaniment during either ground or air transport, and have defined standards regarding accompaniment. Survey results will be taken to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) Transport Team for discussion. The current guideline will be revised once local consensus is achieved for use within CCHMC Transport Team Services.</p></div>
