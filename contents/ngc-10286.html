<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the BMJ Technology Assessment Group (BMJ-TAG) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Description and Discussion of Appropriateness of Manufacturer's Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer provided the search terms and strategies implemented in the manufacturer's review of the literature as an Appendix. The manufacturer searched the literature to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the clinical effectiveness of pixantrone monotherapy and relevant comparators in the treatment of patients with multiply relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In addition to the comparators available as treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in the PIX301 trial, the manufacturer also searched the literature for data on bendamustine, bortezomib, and lenalidomide.</p>
<p>The manufacturer listed the specific databases searched, the time period covered by the searches, and the date the searches were run. For the review of the literature on the clinical effectiveness of the listed interventions, the manufacturer supplemented the search by reviewing the websites of various relevant organisations, including American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Association for Cancer Research, and European Society for Medical Oncology. The manufacturer also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and company websites of manufacturers of interventions identified as being of interest. Reference lists of identified studies and systematic reviews were hand searched for additional relevant studies.</p>
<p>Within the searches, the manufacturer used multiple search terms for NHL and for pixantrone. However, search terms of other listed interventions were limited to the common drug name. The manufacturer restricted the search for studies on the clinical effectiveness to citations published from January 1995; restriction applied to all databases. The manufacturer carried out the electronic literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE in December 2011, and of CENTRAL in November 2011. The Evidence Review Group (ERG) notes that the span of the manufacturer's search did not capture the full publication of PIX301, which was published in May 2012. A published systematic review of interventions in the treatment of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; search date January 2010) reported no RCTs evaluating monotherapy treatments in this population. It should be noted that inclusion criteria for this review were published systematic reviews and RCTs in any language, including unblinded studies, and containing more than 50 individuals per treatment arm of whom more than 80% were followed up and a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. The ERG considers that the manufacturer's restriction of the span of the search is unlikely to have resulted in publications relevant to the decision problem being missed.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the ERG was unable to replicate the manufacturer's search and appraisal of identified abstracts for all databases. However, the ERG carried out a separate search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library in January 2013 to update the manufacturer's search. The ERG used the manufacturer's search terms, and considers that all studies relevant to the clinical effectiveness of pixantrone monotherapy in the treatment of multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL are likely to have been identified. In addition, the ERG identified no systematic review evaluating monotherapy treatment in multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL. In summary, the ERG considers that the manufacturer searched the key electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, and that the search strategies used were appropriate for the decision problem that is the focus of this Single Technology Appraisal (STA).</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria Used in Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion criteria applied by the manufacturer for their systematic review are summarised in Table 4 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Although the manufacturer did not specify exclusion criteria for the review, based on the manufacturer's description of the systematic review process, the ERG considers the exclusion criteria to be implicit (e.g., studies published in a non-English language were excluded).</p>
<p>The ERG considers the manufacturer's inclusion criteria, and accompanying rationales, to be mostly appropriate. With reference to the exclusion of non-English language studies, given the anticipated paucity of studies evaluating interventions in the population of interest, the ERG considers that studies in any language and meeting the other inclusion criteria would be of relevance to the decision problem. However, given the acknowledged lack of evidence in the specified population, the ERG considers it is unlikely that key studies have been omitted from the manufacturer's submission.</p>
<p><strong>Included and Excluded Studies in Review of Clinical Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer provided a single flow diagram that encompassed the review of the literature for evidence on clinical effectiveness, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), economics, and resources. The diagram included a summary of the results of each individual search. The flow diagram provided by the manufacturer indicates that six publications were identified by the review of the clinical effectiveness literature. The manufacturer's search of the literature was carried out prior to publication of results of the PIX301 trial in a peer-reviewed journal. The manufacturer identified four conference abstracts presenting results from the PIX301 trial. As conference abstracts, details of methodological processes and results are minimal. Of the four abstracts identified by the manufacturer, two abstracts focused on the PIX301 trial, which the Evidence Review Group (ERG) considers relevant to the decision problem. The remaining two conference abstracts provided an overview of clinical trials of pixantrone, including the PIX301 study, in addition to trials in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and evaluating pixantrone as a first-line treatment. The ERG does not consider the two abstracts providing an overview of pixantrone to be relevant to the decision problem as presented data are also reported elsewhere. Of the two remaining publications, one is the manufacturer's registration of the methodology of the PIX301 trial (first published in 2004 and updated in 2011), and the second is a summary of the two conference abstracts presenting data from the PIX301 trial.</p>
<p>No relevant non-RCTs were identified by the manufacturer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p>The manufacturer carried out a systematic review of the literature to identify full economic evaluations and/or resource use or cost studies in patients who had relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL after at least two prior therapies. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE; EMBASE; MEDLINE (R) In-Process, EconLIT and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). The searches were carried out between 16th December 2011 and 2nd February 2012 and were restricted by date (from year 2000) and language (English language). No country restrictions were applied; however, the manufacturer stated that UK-based studies were preferred. The manufacturer's rationale for applying publication date and language limits was to "select those studies relevant to the decision problem and the current clinical practice in the UK".</p>
<p>In addition, the websites of manufacturers of treatments currently used in multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were also searched (between 2nd and 20th February 2012), as were the websites of the following organisations:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) </li>
    <li>European Association for Cancer Research (EACR) </li>
    <li>European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) </li>
    <li>National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) </li>
    <li>National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) </li>
    <li>Health Technology Assessments via the Cochrane Library (HTAs). </li>
</ul>
<p>After consideration of 4,345 records retrieved by the review, no relevant economic evaluations or costing studies were identified by the manufacturer. The Evidence Review Group (ERG) considers that the search terms (see Appendix 10 of the ERG report [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) and inclusion/exclusion criteria used in the review were reasonable, and, therefore, the ERG considers it unlikely that relevant publications were excluded.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the BMJ Technology Assessment Group (BMJ-TAG) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer assessed the PIX301 trial against criteria adapted from guidance for undertaking reviews in health care issued by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, as provided in NICE's template for manufacturer/sponsor submission of evidence to the Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. The ERG independently validated PIX301 and agrees with the manufacturer's assessment; the manufacturer's assessment, together with accompanying minor comments from the ERG, is presented in Appendix 3 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Evidence on the clinical effectiveness of pixantrone is appropriately derived from the PIX301 trial. The ERG's critique of the design and conduct of PIX301 is discussed in more detail below and in section 4.2 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Summary and Critique of Submitted Clinical Effectiveness Evidence</strong> </p>
<p>The primary objective of the PIX301 trial was to compare the clinical effectiveness of pixantrone monotherapy against treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in terms of complete response (CR) and unconfirmed CR (CRu) at the end of treatment in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Included patients had multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (patients previously treated with &ge;2 chemotherapy regimens). Evaluation of CR and CRu was based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for NHL and was determined by a blinded Independent Assessment Panel (IAP). Secondary objectives were to evaluate comparative clinical effectiveness of pixantrone on overall survival (OS), CR/CRu rate in histologically confirmed patients, overall response rate (ORR) lasting at least 4 months, and progression-free survival (PFS).</p>
<p>See section 4.2 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for additional description and critique of the PIX01 trial.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary and Critique of Manufacturer's Submitted Economic Evaluation by the ERG</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer developed a <em>de novo</em> economic model which considered pixantrone versus TPC in a population of patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL, who had received at least two prior therapies. The model was constructed in Microsoft&copy; EXCEL over a life-time (23 year) time horizon and captured costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with an average patient treated with either pixantrone or TPC. Individual patient level data from the PIX301 trial were used to populate the model. In addition, as part of the manufacturer's clarification response, a corrected list price for pixantrone was provided. Unless otherwise stated all results presented within this report are based on the corrected list price for pixantrone.</p>
<p>Overall, the ERG considers the manufacturer's model to be well constructed and largely transparent. However, the ERG considers it important to note that the manufacturer's base case economic evaluation included data from patients whose disease had not been histologically confirmed as aggressive. The ERG considers this to be an important limitation of the manufacturer's base case analysis. Furthermore, the ERG notes that the results of the subgroup analysis (requested at clarification) in patients with B-cell NHL that has been histologically confirmed as aggressive is more informative to the decision problem that is the focus of this single technology assessment.</p>
<p>See Section 5.2 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for additional description and critique of the economic model.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the outlined structure of the models adhered to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reference case for economic analysis and was acceptable for assessing the cost-effectiveness of pixantrone.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee was persuaded that the manufacturer's mean probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of &pound;22,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained could overestimate the uncertainty associated with the survival modelling and that the true value of the ICER might be lower. It further concluded that there was an increase in response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival for pixantrone compared with treatment of physician's choice. However, these results were not statistically significant.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee was aware that the utility value used by the manufacturer in its revised model incorporating the patient access scheme for the pre-progression health state was similar to that expected for an older population in the UK. The Committee considered that the quality of life of patients receiving third- or fourth-line treatment for aggressive non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma could be lower than this. The Committee concluded that, although there was some uncertainty as to the true utility value, the utility values used in the manufacturer's revised model that was part of the patient access scheme submission were appropriate for use in the Committee's decision-making. The Committee observed that there were no additional gains in health-related quality of life over those already included in the QALY calculations and concluded that there were no additional QALYs that had not been incorporated into the economic model and the cost-effectiveness estimates.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>
<p>The patient access scheme applies to patients with histologically confirmed aggressive non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma who have previously received rituximab and are receiving pixantrone as a third- or fourth-line treatment.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that there was limited and non-robust evidence to show pixantrone was more clinically effective than treatments currently used in clinical practice for treating multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. It further concluded that there was an increase in response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival for pixantrone compared with treatment of physician's choice. However, these results were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>The patient access scheme reduced the mean probabilistic ICER to &pound;22,000 per QALY gained. The Committee was persuaded that this ICER could overestimate the uncertainty associated with the survival modelling and that the true value of the ICER might be lower.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that, for the subgroup of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma confirmed by central independent pathological review for third- or fourth-line treatment and who had previously received rituximab, the manufacturer's deterministic ICER incorporating the patient access scheme was &pound;18,500 per QALY gained and the manufacturer's mean probabilistic ICER was &pound;22,000 per QALY gained. The Committee noted that the exploratory analysis showed a high level of uncertainty around the ICER. However, the Committee was persuaded that this analysis could overestimate the uncertainty associated with the survival modelling and that the true value of the ICER might be lower. The Committee concluded that because the probabilistic ICER was likely to be less than &pound;22,000 per QALY gained pixantrone was recommended as a cost-effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources.</p>

    <li>Section 7(6) of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/259/contents/made" title="HM Government Web site">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013</a> requires clinical commissioning groups, National Health Service (NHS) England and, with respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the recommendations in this appraisal within 3 months of its date of publication. </li>
    <li>When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraph above. This means that, if a patient has multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that pixantrone is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations.&nbsp; </li>
