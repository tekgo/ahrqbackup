<div class="content_para"><p>For staging please refer to the Appendix in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Minimum work up should include computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis, or CT positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or either of the above with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). </li>
    <li>Enrolment in a clinical trial is preferred. </li>
    <li>Resection
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Complete resection results in a 5% long-term complete remission or cure rate and may contribute greatly to the quality of life. </li>
        <li>If primary chemotherapy is used, consideration should be given to subsequent resection. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Systemic Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Options include:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Enrolment in a clinical trial (preferred) </li>
        <li>Observation </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Following resection, a number of systemic therapies have been investigated (e.g., interferon-alpha [IFN-alpha], dacarbazine, temozolomide, high-dose interleukin-2 [IL-2], combination chemotherapy with cisplatin or vinblastine with or without IL-1 and IFN-alpha, and paclitaxel alone or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy); however, no convincing disease-free survival or overall survival benefits have been documented. </li>
    <li>Following systemic therapy, scans should be repeated.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>If scans are negative for other disease, resect as necessary. If there is no further evidence of disease, consider clinical trial OR IFN-alpha OR observation. If there is residual disease, treat as disseminated (unresectable) disease (e.g., additional systemic therapy, surgical resection, or radiation for palliative care and symptom management). </li>
        <li>If scans are positive for other disease, treat as disseminated (unresectable) disease. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (Patient or Population, Intervention, Comparisons, Outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Question</strong></p>
<p>What are the best treatment and management options for improving the survival and management of symptoms in patients with resectable Stage IV primary cutaneous melanoma?</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE, Cochrane, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Abstracts and Proceedings, and CANCERLIT databases were searched (1985 through November 2009) for clinical trials. Search terms included: "resectable" or "stage IV" or "advanced" or "metastatic" and "primary cutaneous melanoma" AND "surgery" or "metastectomy" or "radiation therapy" or "chemotherapy" or "interleukin" or "interferon" or "taxane" or "supportive care" or "palliative care." A total of 82 clinical trials (limits: human and English language) were returned, from which 29 documents were selected. In addition, the National Guideline Clearinghouse and individual guideline organizations were searched for practice guidelines relevant to this topic.</p>
<p>For the 2013 update of the guideline, PubMed was searched for evidence on resectable stage IV melanoma. The search term "melanoma" was used and results were limited to clinical trials, published between December 2009 and January 2013. Citations were hand-searched for studies pertaining to in-transit disease.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulate the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>Following a review of the evidence by the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team, no major changes to the recommendations were made.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
