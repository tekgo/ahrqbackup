Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Recommendations are followed by quality of evidence ratings (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, and <strong>Very Low</strong>), and the strength of the recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong> or <strong>Conditional</strong>) which are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: Technical remarks designed to facilitate implementation accompany each recommendation and can be found in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of Persons with Immune-Active Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends antiviral therapy for adults with immune-active CHB (hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] negative or HBeAg positive) to decrease the risk of liver-related complications. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Moderate, Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<p>The AASLD recommends pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN), entecavir, or tenofovir as preferred initial therapy for adults with immune-active CHB. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low, Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of Adults with Immune-Tolerant CHB</span></strong></p>
<p>The AASLD recommends against antiviral therapy for adults with immune-tolerant CHB. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Moderate, Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<p>The AASLD suggests that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels be tested at least every 6 months for adults with immune-tolerant CHB to monitor for potential transition to immune-active or -inactive CHB. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very low, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>The AASLD suggests antiviral therapy in the select group of adults &gt;40 years of age with normal ALT and elevated hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA) (&ge;1,000,000 IU/mL) and liver biopsy showing significant necroinflammation or fibrosis. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very low, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of HBeAg Positive Immune-Active Chronic Hepatitis Persons Who Seroconvert to Anti-HBe on Nucleos(t)ide Analog (NA) Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>The AASLD suggests that HBeAg-positive adults without cirrhosis with CHB who seroconvert to anti-HBe on therapy discontinue NAs after a period of treatment consolidation. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>The AASLD suggests indefinite antiviral therapy for HBeAg-positive adults with cirrhosis with CHB who seroconvert to anti-HBe on NA therapy, based on concerns for potential clinical decompensation and death, unless there is a strong competing rationale for treatment discontinuation. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Duration of Treatment in Persons with HBeAg-Negative Immune-Active CHB</span></strong></p>
<p>The AASLD suggests indefinite antiviral therapy for adults with HBeAg-negative immune-active CHB unless there is a competing rationale for treatment discontinuation. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Renal and Bone Disease in Persons on NA Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>The AASLD suggests no preference between entecavir and tenofovir regarding potential long-term risks of renal and bone complications. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low (bone); Low (renal), Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management of Persons with Persistent Low-Level Viremia on NA Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>The AASLD suggests that persons with persistent low level viremia (&lt;2,000 IU/mL) on entecavir or tenofovir monotherapy continue monotherapy, regardless of ALT. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>The AASLD suggests one of two strategies in persons with virological breakthrough on entecavir or tenofovir monotherapy: either switch to another antiviral monotherapy with high barrier to resistance or add a second antiviral drug that lacks cross-resistance. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management of Adults with Cirrhosis and Low-Level Viremia</span></strong></p>
<p>The AASLD suggests that adults with compensated cirrhosis and low levels of viremia (&lt;2,000 IU/ mL) be treated with antiviral therapy to reduce the risk of decompensation, regardless of ALT level. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>The AASLD recommends that hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive adults with decompensated cirrhosis be treated with antiviral therapy indefinitely regardless of HBV DNA level, HBeAg status, or ALT level to decrease risk of worsening liver-related complications. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Moderate, Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>) </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of CHB in Pregnancy</span></strong></p>
<p>The AASLD suggests antiviral therapy to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B in HBsAg-positive pregnant women with an HBV DNA level &gt;200,000 IU/mL. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>The AASLD recommends against the use of antiviral therapy to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B in the HBsAg-positive pregnant woman with an HBV DNA &le;200,000 IU/mL. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low, Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of CHB in Children</span></strong></p>
<p>The AASLD suggests antiviral therapy in HBeAg-positive children (ages 2 to &lt;18 years) with both elevated ALT and measurable HBV DNA levels, with the goal of achieving sustained HBeAg seroconversion. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Moderate, Strength of Recommendation: Conditional</strong>)</p>
<p>The AASLD recommends against use of antiviral therapy in HBeAg-positive children (ages 2 to &lt;18 years) with persistently normal ALT, regardless of HBV DNA level. (<strong>Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low, Strength of Recommendation: Strong</strong>)</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A methodologist moderated and facilitated the process of question development. A separate group of American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) content experts collaborated with an independent research group with expertise in conducting systematic reviews to synthesize the available evidence informing the key questions. See the original guideline document for the key questions and see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the systematic reviews.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Antiviral Therapy in Chronic Hepatitis B Viral Infection during Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The systematic review group included controlled or comparative studies that enrolled pregnant women diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus (HBV) infection (characterized by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] for more than 6 months), who received antiviral therapy and reported the outcomes of interest, including prevention of mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) of HBV, clinical efficacy, and adverse outcomes from antiviral therapy to both mothers and newborns. Both English and non-English-language studies were included. The systematic review group excluded studies that enrolled infants who did not receive immunization during the first week postpartum; studies of patients coinfected with hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); patients receiving steroids, chemotherapy/immunotherapy, liver transplantation, and hemodialysis; and uncontrolled studies or studies published as abstracts only.</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search of Medline In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus was conducted from early 1988 to September 11, 2014. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the principal investigator. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of antivirals for hepatitis B in pregnancy. Details of the search strategy are available in Supporting Table 1 of the systematic review. A manual search of bibliographies of the included studies and relevant systematic reviews was conducted. Content experts from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) were also queried for potential references.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts for potential eligibility in duplicate using an online reference management system (DistillerSR; Evidence Partners, Inc.). Included abstracts were then reviewed in full text following the same procedure. Disagreements were reconciled by consensus or by a third reviewer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Antiviral Therapy in Management of Chronic Hepatitis B Viral Infection in Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The systematic review group included studies that enrolled children (&lt;18 years) with chronic HBV infection treated with antiviral therapy. Due to the anticipated limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating patient-important (clinical) outcomes, the group included observational studies that evaluated such outcomes. Outcomes of interest were cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization, HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) suppression, hepatitis B e antigen/hepatitis B surface antigen (HBeAg/HBsAg) seroconversion, and HBeAg/HBsAg loss. They included both English and non-English-language studies. They excluded studies enrolling adults; patients coinfected with hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or HIV; patients receiving combination therapy, steroids, or chemotherapy/immunotherapy; liver transplant recipients; and hemodialysis patients. Supporting Table S1 of the systematic review describes the detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the principal investigator. A comprehensive search of Medline In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus was conducted from January 1988 to December 2, 2014. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of antiviral therapy for hepatitis B in children. Supporting Table S2 of the systematic review provides details of the search strategy. The systematic review group conducted a manual search of bibliographies of the included studies and previous systematic reviews to identify relevant studies. Content experts from the AASLD were also queried for potential references.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selections</strong></p>
<p>Using an online reference management system (DistillerSR; Evidence Partners, Inc.), two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts. Full texts of the included abstracts were retrieved and screened in duplicate. Disagreements were harmonized by consensus or arbitration by a third reviewer. The Committee calculated interrater agreement (kappa) during the full text screening to observe the agreement between reviewers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Antiviral Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis B Viral Infection in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The systematic review group included RCTs and controlled observational studies that enrolled adults &ge;18 years old diagnosed with chronic HBV infection who received antiviral therapy. They excluded studies that included patients with acute HBV infection; patients who were pregnant; patients coinfected with hepatitis C or D or HIV; patients receiving corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressive therapy; transplant recipients; and hemodialysis patients, as well as studies without control or comparison groups. Supporting Table S1 of the systematic review summarizes the inclusion and exclusion criteria for each key question.</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>An experienced Mayo Clinic librarian conducted a comprehensive search of Medline In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus from early 1988 to September 16, 2014. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for comparative studies of antivirals for CHB. No language restrictions were used. Members from the AASLD HBV guideline methodology and writing committees helped identify additional studies. Supporting Table S2 of the systematic review specifies the detailed search strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selections</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for potential eligibility using an online reference management system (DistillerSR; Evidence Partners, Inc.). Full texts of the included abstracts were retrieved and screened in duplicate. Disagreements were resolved by seeking consensus or arbitration by a third reviewer. Interreviewer agreement (kappa) was calculated during each screening level to assess agreement between reviewers. For Population Intervention Comparison Outcome questions where no studies meeting the predefined criteria were found, the AASLD HBV guideline methodology committee performed manual searches for uncontrolled observational studies. Data from these studies were summarized narratively and in general consistent with low-quality evidence.</p></div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Antiviral Therapy in Chronic Hepatitis B Viral Infection during Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>For each study, data extraction was done in duplicate using a standardized, pretested form. A third reviewer compared data and resolved inconsistencies by referring to the full text of the articles. The systematic review group extracted the following data from each study: study characteristics, patient baseline characteristics, intervention details, and outcomes of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The systematic review group was interested in the following outcomes: infant outcomes including the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) transmission, defined by hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity at 6-12 months or hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA) positivity at 6-12 months; Apgar score (1 minute); prematurity rate; and congenital malformation rate. Maternal outcomes included HBV DNA suppression, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) loss, HBeAg seroconversion, cesarean section rate, postpartum hemorrhage rate, and elevated creatine kinase.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias (i.e., systematic error) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, respectively. The quality of evidence (i.e., certainty in the estimates) was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Criteria used to evaluate quality of evidence were risk of bias, indirectness (surrogate outcomes), imprecision (wide confidence intervals), inconsistency (heterogeneity), and publication bias.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong></p>
<p>For dichotomized outcomes, the systematic review group calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using binomial distribution. They then pooled the log-transformed RRs using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect models and estimated heterogeneity using the Mantel-Haenszel model. For continuous outcomes, the committee calculated the weighted difference in means between the baseline and the longest duration of follow-up for each study and the pooled effect size using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect model. To measure the overall heterogeneity across the included studies, the systematic review group used the I<sup>2</sup> statistic, where I<sup>2</sup> &gt;50% suggests high heterogeneity. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA, version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). They planned to explore the impact of publication bias using the Egger regression asymmetry test and constructing funnel plots if a sufficient number of studies (&gt;20) per outcome was available and heterogeneity was low.</p>

<p><strong>Methodological Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The systematic review group used the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool and modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the risk of bias in RCTs and observational studies, respectively. Quality of evidence (i.e., certainty in the estimates) was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Criteria used to evaluate quality of evidence were risk of bias, indirectness (surrogate outcomes), imprecision (wide confidence intervals), inconsistency (heterogeneity), and publication bias.</p>

To measure the overall heterogeneity across the included studies, the systematic review group calculated the I<sup>2</sup> statistic, where I<sup>2</sup> &gt;50% suggests a high degree of heterogeneity. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA, version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). To explore heterogeneity, they conducted subgroup analysis for studies enrolling patients with more advanced liver disease; they performed stratified analysis for the following groups: compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, acute on chronic liver failure, and severe acute exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The systematic review group explored the impact of publication bias using the Egger regression asymmetry test and constructing funnel plots if a sufficient number of studies (&gt;20) per outcome was available and heterogeneity was low.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A methodologist moderated and facilitated the process of question development. A separate group of American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) content experts collaborated with an independent research group with expertise in conducting systematic reviews to synthesize the available evidence informing these key questions. By multiple face-to-face meetings, phone conferences, and electronic communication, the systematic review group finalized evidence summaries following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. In this approach, the quality of evidence (i.e., certainty in evidence) is rated as high, moderate, low, or very low based on the domains of precision, directness, consistency, and risk of bias and publication bias. The guideline-writing group based its recommendations on the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, and clinical context. Recommendations are graded as strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation) or conditional (apply to the majority of patients whose values and preferences are consistent with the course of action). Technical remarks are added to recommendations to facilitate implementation. Evidence profiles corresponding to five of the key questions are presented as an appendix to the original guideline document. For the remaining questions with sparse and indirect evidence, relevant studies are summarized after each recommendation (see the original guideline document).</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), whether spontaneous or after antiviral therapy, reduces risk of hepatic decompensation and improves survival. </li>
    <li>Patient selection and timing of treatment are critical decisions in order to avoid overtreatment, maximize therapeutic benefit while limiting duration of therapy, and minimize risk for antiviral drug resistance later in life. </li>
    <li>Antiviral therapy in patients with immune active chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus (HBV) infection can reduce the risk of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. </li>
    <li>In immune tolerant patients, moderate-quality evidence supports improved intermediate outcomes with antiviral therapy. </li>
    <li>Antiviral therapy improves HBV suppression and reduces mother to child transmission (MTCT) in women with chronic HBV infection with high viral load compared to the use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and vaccination alone; the use of telbivudine, lamivudine, and tenofovir appears to be safe in pregnancy with no increased adverse maternal or fetal outcome. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This document presents official recommendations of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) on the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus (HBV) infection in adults and children. Unlike previous AASLD practice guidelines, this guideline was developed in compliance with the Institute of Medicine standards for trustworthy practice guidelines and uses the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Multiple systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to support the recommendations in this practice guideline. An enhanced understanding of this guideline will be obtained by reading the applicable portions of the systematic reviews. </li>
    <li>This guideline focuses on using antiviral therapy in chronic HBV infection and does not address other related and important issues, such as screening, prevention, and surveillance. For broader issues related to diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention as well as treatment in special populations (e.g., liver transplant recipients) that are not addressed by this guideline, the previous AASLD guideline and recent World Health Organization (WHO) guideline are excellent additional resources. </li>
