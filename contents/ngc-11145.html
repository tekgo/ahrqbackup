Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the level of the evidence (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) and strength of the recommendations (<strong>Grade A-C</strong>) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does the Dose of Estrogen Affect Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Rates?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>There are no randomized trials large enough to compare thrombosis risk in patients on oral contraceptives containing different doses of ethinyl estradiol (EE). Only level II-2 studies exist, including large cohort and case-control studies. It is difficult to compare the effect of the EE dose since preparations differ with respect to the progestin component. In addition, observational studies are limited by a number of unmeasured confounders and bias. The following may be concluded from the literature:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>While no longer available in the United States, high-dose combined oral contraception (COC) (&gt;50 &micro;g) is associated with higher risks of VTE than lower-dose formulations. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is fair evidence that combined oral contraception with 50 &micro;g EE has a higher risk of thrombosis compared with sub-50 &micro;g EE formulations. (<strong>Grade B</strong>). However, data are conflicting and difficult to interpret due to the variable progestin component of the pills studied. </li>
    <li>There is fair evidence that COCs containing EE doses lower than 35 &micro;g have similar VTE risk to 35 &micro;g formulations. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does Type of Progestin Contribute to VTE Risk?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>There are no randomized trials large enough to compare the risk of VTE in patients on different types of oral contraceptives. Only level II-2 studies exist, including large cohort and case-control studies. It is difficult to compare the effect of the progestin component alone, as some studies include preparations with different doses of EE. In addition, observational studies are limited by a number of confounders and bias (including differences in users and non-users of COCs, duration of combined oral contraception use, and misclassification of VTE due to differences in diagnostic criteria used).</p>
<p>Because of the lack of high-quality level I studies comparing progestins, it is possible that methodological problems in the present studies are responsible for the small increased risk in VTE events, and that there is actually no increased risk with third- or fourth-generation progestins, such as desogestrel or drospirenone. If there is indeed an increased relative risk (RR), the absolute risk increase is extremely small. Therefore, in the appropriately selected patient, the choice of COC method does not need to be made based on the type of progestin. If a woman has estrogen-related COC risk for VTE, then no route of administration or dose of estrogen has been found to be safer. All estrogen-containing hormonal methods are contraindicated in that setting.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is fair evidence that all available combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) preparations increase the risk of VTE over the non-pregnant state. </li>
    <li>There is fair evidence that women using preparations of COC with drospirenone or third-generation progestins have a slightly higher risk of VTE compared with those using norethindrone or levonorgestrel. (<strong>Grade B</strong>). These results may in part be related to characteristics of the populations using these preparations. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does Route of Administration of CHC Contribute to VTE Risk?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>All of the studies addressing this question were level II-III.</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence that the contraceptive patch or contraceptive vaginal ring has a different risk of VTE compared with COCs. (<strong>Grade C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Are Smoking, Obesity, or Inherited Thrombophilias Risk Factors for VTE in CHC Users?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>Several level II and III studies have identified risk factors associated with VTE; however, determining to what degree a specific risk factor increases the risk of VTE is difficult as these studies are heterogeneous and are often confounded by biases.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is fair evidence that tobacco use, age (&gt;35 years), obesity, and the presence of hereditary thrombophilias (including factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation and protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency) increase the risk of thrombotic events in the setting of CHC use. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>In the patient in whom combined hormonal contraception is appropriate, it is reasonable to use any currently available preparation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized, controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grade A</strong>: There is good evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p>
<p><strong>Grade B</strong>: There is fair evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p>
<p><strong>Grade C</strong>: There is insufficient evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This report was developed under the direction of the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine as a service to its members and other practicing clinicians. Although this document reflects appropriate management of a problem encountered in the practice of reproductive medicine, it is not intended to be the only approved standard of practice or to dictate an exclusive course of treatment. Other plans of management may be appropriate, taking into account the needs of the individual patient, available resources, and institutional or clinical practice limitations. </li>
    <li>There are no large, prospective randomized studies comparing the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among various doses of estrogen, types of progestin, or routes of administration. Only level II-2 studies exist, including large cohort and case-control studies that are limited by a number of methodological issues which may skew results. For example, without randomization, it is difficult to control for different patient populations and prescriber bias. It is also important to recognize that VTE risk is greater in new hormonal contraceptive users during the first year, in older women, and in obese women. Many studies do not adequately account for imbalances in these risk factors between treatment groups. In addition, the diagnosis of venous thrombosis may not always be accurate in studies since cases are not always confirmed by hospital records or radiologic studies. Finally, given that the incidence of VTE is low, large numbers of observations are required to compare cases among various treatment groups. </li>
