Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of recommendation (<strong>1A&ndash;2C</strong>) and the approach to rating the quality of evidence are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>General Issues Regarding Risk</strong></span></p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer who are potential candidates for curative surgical resection, it is recommended that they be assessed by a multidisciplinary team, which includes a thoracic surgeon specializing in lung cancer, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and pulmonologist (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p>In elderly patients with lung cancer who are potential candidates for curative surgical resection it is recommended that they be fully evaluated regardless of age (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery who have increased perioperative cardiovascular risk, a preoperative cardiologic evaluation is recommended, with further management according to existing cardiologic guidelines for non cardiac surgery (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Perioperative Morbidity and Mortality</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Spirometry and Diffusing Capacity</strong></p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery, it is recommended that both forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and diffusing capacity (D<sub>LCO</sub>) be measured in all patients and that both predicted postoperative (PPO) FEV<sub>1</sub> and PPO D<sub>LCO</sub> are calculated (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>PPO Lung Function</strong></p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery, if both PPO FEV<sub>1 </sub>and PPO D<sub>LCO</sub> are &gt;60% predicted, no further tests are recommended (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Values of both PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> and PPO D<sub>LCO</sub> are &gt;60% indicate low risk for perioperative death and cardiopulmonary complications following resection including pneumonectomy.</p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery, if either the PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> or PPO D<sub>LCO</sub> are &lt;60% predicted and both are above 30% predicted, it is recommended that a low technology exercise test (stair climb or shuttle walk test [SWT]) is performed (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery, with either a PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;30% predicted or a PPO D<sub>LCO</sub> &lt;30% predicted performance of a formal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) with measurement of maximal oxygen consumption (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) is recommended (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Either a PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;30% predicted or a PPO D<sub>LCO</sub> &lt;30% predicted indicate an increased risk for perioperative death and cardiopulmonary complications with anatomic lung resection.</p>
<p><strong>Arterial Blood Gas Tensions</strong></p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery who walk &lt;25 shuttles (or &lt;400 m) on the SWT or climb &lt;22 m at symptom limited stair climbing test, performance of a formal CPET with measurement of Vo<sub>2</sub>max is recommended (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Walking &lt;25 shuttles (or &lt;400 m) on the SWT or climbing &lt;22 m at symptom limited stair climbing test suggests an increased risk for perioperative death and cardiopulmonary complications with anatomic lung resection.</p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery and a Vo<sub>2</sub>max &lt;10 mL/kg/min or &lt;35% predicted it is recommended that they are counseled about minimally invasive surgery, sublobar resections or nonoperative treatment options for their lung cancer (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: A Vo<sub>2</sub>max &lt;10 mL/kg/min or &lt;35% predicted indicates a high risk for perioperative death and cardiopulmonary complications with major anatomic lung resection through thoracotomy.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: For values of Vo<sub>2</sub>max in the range of 10 to 15 mL/kg/min an increased risk of mortality is expected. However, data are less definitive for making decisions based solely on those values without taking into account other factors like PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>LCO</sub> as well as patient comorbidities.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Long-term Pulmonary Disability with Neoadjuvant Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery who undergo neoadjuvant therapy, it is suggested that repeat pulmonary function testing with diffusion capacity be performed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods to Reduce Perioperative Risks and Long-term Pulmonary Disability</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer in an area of upper lobe emphysema who are candidates for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), combined LVRS and lung cancer resection is suggested (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p>In all patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery who are actively smoking, tobacco dependence treatment is recommended (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Smoking cessation is associated with short-term perioperative and long-term survival benefits (see also specific recommendations for tobacco cessation in the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP] guideline <a href="/content.aspx?id=46163" title="Guideline #9871">Treatment of tobacco use in lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed</a>).</p>
<p>In patients with lung cancer being considered for surgery and deemed at high risk (as defined by the proposed functional algorithm, i.e., PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> or PPO D<sub>LCO</sub> &lt;60% and Vo<sub>2</sub>max &lt;10 mL/kg/min or &lt;35%), preoperative or postoperative pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Study Quality</strong></p>
<p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were assessed using Documentation and Appraisal Review Tool (DART) (R. L. Diekemper; B. K. Ireland, MD; and L. R. Merz, PhD, MPH, DART, unpublished data, 2012), which was developed as an improved alternative to the existing tools for use in a clinical setting. However, this tool has been adopted for use in American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines and consensus statements since 2011.</p>
<p>Quality was assessed for each study as well as for the body of relevant evidence. Based on the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) questions and volume of available literature, multiple study designs were included in the systematic reviews of the literature. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) primarily indicate benefits, but whenever observational studies met inclusion criteria they were often helpful in identifying harms. Observational studies were also examined when RCTs were not available to answer a particular PICO question. Allowing for multiple study designs resulted in the need for multiple quality assessment tools. Tools were chosen for assessing RCTs, observational studies, and diagnostic studies. The quality assessment tool for RCTs (R. L. Diekemper, B. K. Ireland, and L. R. Merz, unpublished data, 2012) was used for assessing the quality of RCTs, and a tool developed by the committee of the ninth edition of the Antithrombotics Guidelines was used for assessing the quality of observational studies. Diagnostic studies were assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS).</p>
<p><strong>Meta-analyses</strong></p>
<p>If a recently published good-quality meta-analysis was available, then it was used to inform the recommendations. When a good-quality meta-analysis was not available, guideline authors were encouraged to perform their own meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were performed when the data were fairly homogeneous. If a study was deemed poor quality, then it was not included in the pooled analysis. Heterogeneity of the pooled results was assessed using a <em>&chi;</em><sup>2</sup> test and Higgins <em>I</em><sup>2</sup>, and a forest plot was examined for consistency of the results. The random effects model was chosen a priori as the appropriate model for pooling the data because it accounts for heterogeneity among the included studies. Results from the meta-analyses are available in the supplementary materials that can be downloaded from the Journal website under the corresponding article in the table of contents.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Panel Composition and Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>A call for applications to serve on the 3rd edition of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Lung Cancer Guidelines (LC III) panel was put forth to the ACCP membership, to past panelists, and to other organizations that have previously endorsed earlier editions of these guidelines or appointed representatives to serve on those panels. Guiding the team was the LC III Executive Committee, composed of a Panel Chair, Vice Chair, Liaison to the Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC), and two staff members, one serving as an adviser and the other as the lead methodologist. The GOC appointed the Liaison and the Chair, who was required to be free of conflicts of interest (COI). This Executive Committee provided general oversight and guidance; multiple reviews of research questions, article outlines, manuscripts, evidence tables, and other supporting documents; and facilitation of the final conference discussions and voting. As the scope was defined, content experts in each major area were identified to serve as topic editors and nominated by the Panel Chair to be advanced to the GOC for the requisite qualifications and COI review and approval process. These topic editors organized their research and writing teams, oversaw the work of the individual members, edited separate contributions into synthesized manuscripts, presented evidence at the final conference, and managed any of their committee members who were approved with management stipulations relevant to their COIs.</p>
<p>Each topic editor was initially charged with proposing individuals to support their topic committees with expertise in the content area and/or methodology. With the Chair's approval, these individuals were nominated for GOC reviews for COI and expertise. In some cases, GOC staff helped to locate additional methodologic support when it was determined to be necessary for various article committees. This resulted in an international panel of &gt;100 multidisciplinary experts across 24 articles representing the fields of pulmonary medicine, critical care medicine, thoracic surgery, medical and radiation oncology, pathology, integrative medicine, primary care, health-care research, guidelines methodology, and epidemiology. Nineteen international organizations that are also dedicated to advancing research and practice in the area of lung cancer were invited to appoint representatives to this guideline project as adjunct participants. These individuals, unless already approved panelists, were not considered full voting members of the panel, since they had not been through the same ACCP COI review, but were included at the final conference, participated fully in the discussions, and provided external review and feedback on the manuscripts and supporting documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>In most cases the topic editors, along with the other completely non-conflicted members of the article committee, formulated the recommendations. The summarized evidence tables and profiles (where profiles existed) provided the foundation for the recommendations. In formulating the recommendations, panelists considered not only the body of evidence but also the balance between the benefits and harms and considerations of other factors, such as cost or resource availability considerations and patient values and preferences, which might vary widely for some recommendations. These additional considerations are described in a Remarks section, which appears just below the relevant recommendation in the publication, each time the recommendation appears.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations that are strong must be differentiated from those that are weak or weaker. Thus, the ACCP Grading System was used (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field), and the wording of the recommendations is explicit. This grading system has been used since 2005 and is based on two dimensions: the balance of benefits to harms and the quality of the evidence base. If the benefits clearly outweigh the harms or the harms clearly outweigh the benefits, the strength of the recommendation is considered strong and graded as a 1. In most cases, when there is strong confidence that the benefits outweigh the harms, most patients would choose the intervention endorsed in that recommendation. However, when the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable consequences are not as clear, variability in patient preferences and values often becomes germane to the decision-making conversation.</p>
<p>Weak recommendations are those for which the benefits and harms are more equally balanced, and thus a clear choice is not as obvious; these are graded with a 2. Strong recommendations are phrased, "the panel recommends," whereas weak recommendations are phrased "the panel suggests." Accompanying these indications of the strength of a recommendation is a letter score (A, B, or C) representing the grading of the body of relevant literature.</p>
<p>In grading the quality of the evidence, RCTs start with a high score but might be downgraded to moderate or even low based on the following criteria: limitations in the study design or conduct of the trial, imprecision, indirectness relative to the specifics of the PICO question, inconsistency in the results, and risk of reporting bias. Observational studies, on the other hand, start off as low-level evidence but can be upgraded to moderate or even high if exceptionally large and consistent treatment effects increase confidence in the findings, especially if there is a strong dose-response gradient.</p>
<p>The final grades are combinations reflecting the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence. Strong recommendations with high quality evidence, grade of 1A, are less common than in past editions of these guidelines, since the evidence is assessed with greater rigor for most topics, and few studies without important limitations are available.</p>
<p>However, recommendations that do attain this score are those for which the panel could state with confidence that new studies would be unlikely to change the direction of the effect. These recommendations apply to most patients in most circumstances. But as the grades decline, patient values and preferences likely would play an increasingly greater role in determining the best treatments or interventions for each patient.</p>
<p><strong>The Final Conference</strong></p>
<p>As the evidence reviews were completed and the tables and profiles prepared, the manuscripts and recommendations were drafted. Members of the article committees convened by phone or e-mail to discuss the evidence and work on drafting and grading the recommendations. These discussions generally resulted in agreement on both the quality of the evidence and strength of the recommendations.</p>
<p>The manuscripts and supporting tables were then reviewed by members of the Executive Committee and, after several iterations, the revised versions were shared among all panelists and the representatives of invited organizations in advance of the conference. The other panelists and representatives were asked not only to provide feedback but also to review the recommendations to identify any controversies. A recommendation was deemed to be controversial if at least one person disagreed with the wording or the grading, if there was controversy in practice, if there were wide variations in practice, or if at least one person asked that it be discussed among the broader panel and association representatives. These identified controversies composed the main agenda for the conference.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Internal and External Peer Review</strong></p>
<p>Once Executive Committee approval was received, the articles were submitted to American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) staff for several layers of review. All reviewers were required to undergo a full conflict of interest (COI) appraisal before being approved. In the first round of reviews, the Thoracic Oncology NetWork reviewed the content of the manuscripts and the members of the Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC) assessed the manuscripts for adherence to the methodology and conformance with the evidence. The ACCP President also appointed members of the Board of Regents to evaluate the guidelines in depth. All comments were collated into spreadsheets to ensure that they were appropriately answered. GOC and board reviewers discussed each comment and determined which should be mandatory for the authors to amend and which were provided as suggestions for improvement. All reviews and comments were anonymous, and authors were required to respond to all mandatory issues either by revising the manuscripts or providing written justification explaining why they did not agree with the reviewers' comments.</p>
<p>The revised manuscripts were submitted for round II review, simultaneously with the Journal peer review. Once the GOC and board reviewers approved the manuscripts, the ACCP President, President Elect, President Elect Designee, and Immediate Past President reviewed the guidelines. Approval was granted pending confirmation from the Board of Regents, before submission to the journal for final review by the Journal Editor. In addition to this extensive review process, which included nearly 30 individual reviewers from the ACCP leadership, external organizations were provided with opportunities to provide feedback before, during, and just after the conference. This final version was submitted for consideration for endorsement to all of the invited organizations, whether or not they sent representatives to the conference. However, once the guidelines were approved by the ACCP Board of Regents, no further changes were accepted. Organizations that provided endorsements are listed in each article.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements

<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines are intended for general information only, are not medical advice, and do not replace professional medical care and physician advice, which always should be sought for any medical condition. The complete disclaimer for this guideline can be accessed at the <a href="http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1682324" title="Chest Journal Web site"><em>CHEST</em> Web site</a>. </li>
    <li>Although the ACCP is moving toward the production of evidence profiles for all guideline recommendations, there were many recommendations for which profiles were not developed, mostly because of resource constraints. When possible, methodologists created evidence profiles, and all panelists were educated on how to read and interpret them. The population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO)-based systematic literature review process was followed for most recommendations, but there were some that could have benefited from meta-analyses. </li>
    <li>One limitation of all guidelines today is that they are not able to adequately address complex patients with multiple morbidities. This is largely because these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials and are often not included in observational studies. Since guidelines are reliant on evidence published in the peer-reviewed literature, the scientific foundation impedes the process of providing good guidance for these patients and is a limitation in these guidelines. Therefore, the ACCP encourages funding agencies to ensure that topics with limited evidence are addressed in future research. </li>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Dissemination and Implementation</strong></p>
<p>These guidelines are widely disseminated through the <em>CHEST</em> journal publication, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Guidelines International Network library. Additional clinical resources will soon be available to users of CHEST Evidence, an upcoming tool for searching the content of America College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines.</p>
<p>As the expanding research into diagnostic techniques and treatment options continues to evolve, the guidelines must be updated and kept current. This edition of the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines will be the last to be published as a complete collection, as the ACCP is now embarking on a new living guidelines model (LGM) for revising existing recommendations and developing new recommendations as the literature evolves. This will include a continual assessment of the currency of these recommendations relevant to new research studies as they are published. The review cycle for the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines will begin 1 year after publication unless the content experts who monitor the literature bring a recommendation or set of related recommendations to the attention of the Guideline oversight Committee (GOC), suggesting that those recommendations are in need of updating sooner. The new LGM will permit a more nimble approach to guideline development but also requires a point-of-care accessible vehicle, CHEST Evidence, for the users to readily search for the most current version. These features will be described in greater detail in upcoming publications. As a step in this direction, these guidelines will be published primarily online with a printed version of the Executive Summary, containing all of the recommendations, the introduction, and this article on methodology. All narratives for each article with their supporting tables, figures, and algorithms will be available online at <a href="http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/" title="Chest Journal Web site">journal.publications.chestnet.org</a>.</p></div>
