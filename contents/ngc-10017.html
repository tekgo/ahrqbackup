Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the grading of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>, <strong>Further research needed</strong>) and quality of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Very Low</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>What Maternal Risk Factors Predispose the Neonate to Metabolic Bone Disease?</strong></p>
<p>Maternal vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for neonatal vitamin D deficiency and abnormal bone health, and the authors suggest that pregnant women be screened for vitamin D deficiency and those that are deficient be supplemented (<strong>Weak</strong>). Insufficient data are available to determine the effect of maternal magnesium sulfate and folic acid use on neonatal bone health (<strong>Further research needed</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Low</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Optimal Type of Feeding to Promote Neonatal Bone Health?</strong></p>
<p>When available, the authors suggest human milk with nutrient fortifier for the preterm infant (<strong>Weak</strong>). When human milk is not available, the authors suggest that nutrient-enriched formula be used (<strong>Weak</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Low</strong></p>
<p><strong>When and How Should Vitamin D Supplements Be Administered?</strong></p>
<p>The authors suggest vitamin D supplementation for healthy breastfed infants and those with malnutrition and/or rickets (<strong>Weak</strong>). Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose, route, and duration of supplementation in each of these conditions (<strong>Further research needed</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Low</strong></p>
<p><strong>Does Parenteral Nutrition (PN) Predispose a Neonate to Metabolic Bone Disease, and if So, Are There PN Formulation Recommendations to Minimize This Risk?</strong></p>
<p>The authors suggest that PN predisposes the infant to metabolic bone disease (<strong>Weak</strong>). The authors suggest using PN formulations with high-dose calcium and phosphorus content (<strong>Weak</strong>). PN aluminum is a risk factor for metabolic bone disease of the neonate (<strong>Strong</strong>), and the authors suggest that future efforts be made to reduce the aluminum content of PN.</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Low/Moderate</strong></p>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For the current Clinical Guideline, a PubMed search was performed to identify pertinent studies using the search terms bone AND neonate* OR infant*. The search was further focused by identifying studies containing at least 1 of the following additional key terms: aluminum; breastfed; breast fed; breast-fed; breast milk; calcium; copper; cysteine; diet; feeding; formula; human milk; magnesium; maternal; mineral; nutrition; parenteral nutrition; phosphorus; preterm formula; rickets; risk factor; total parenteral nutrition; trace element; vitamin D or vitamin K. Studies were excluded if they contained&nbsp;one or more of the following key terms: bone marrow transplant; bone marrow transplantation; cancer; dialysis; hyperparathyroidism; hypoparathyroidism; osteopetrorickets; renal failure; renal tubular acidosis or transplant, which allowed for the exclusion of studies addressing bone disease in the setting of these other medical conditions that were not consistent with the aims of the current Clinical Guidelines. In addition, the following limits regarding the type of study were used: humans; clinical trial; randomized controlled trial (RCT); clinical trial: phase I, phase II, phase III, phase IV; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; guideline; journal article; multicenter study; English language; and published within the last 10 years.

<div class="content_para"><p>These Clinical Guidelines were developed under the guidance of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Board of Directors.</p>
<p>A.S.P.E.N. Clinical Guidelines has adopted concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. Briefly, specific clinical questions where nutrition support is a relevant mode of therapy are developed and key clinical outcomes are identified. A rigorous search of the published literature is conducted, each included study is assessed for research quality, tables of findings are developed, the body of evidence for the question is evaluated, and a recommendation for clinical practice that is based on both the best available evidence and the risks and benefits to patients is developed by consensus. Recommendations are graded as strong when the evidence is strong and/or net benefits outweigh harms. Weak recommendations may be based on weaker evidence and/or important tradeoffs to the patient. When limited research is available to answer a question, no recommendation can be made.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Aluminum is a contaminant of parenteral nutrition (PN) components, and high doses of aluminum have been shown to negatively affect both cognitive development and short-term bone health. In animals and adult humans, excess aluminum has been shown to accumulate at mineralization fronts and is associated with reduced bone formation. In addition, one study reported that bone aluminum concentrations were 10-fold higher in preterm infants who received PN for &gt;3 weeks as compared with control subjects. It has been recently demonstrated that the currently available PN products in the United States have an aluminum content that makes it impossible to meet the new Food and Drug Administration rule of &lt;5 mcg/kg per day of aluminum exposure in patients &lt;50 kg. Thus, it is imperative that manufacturers develop new methods to reduce the aluminum contamination in their products and healthcare professionals be aware of the aluminum exposure in PN-dependent neonates.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Clinical Guidelines are based upon general conclusions of health professionals who, in developing such guidelines, have balanced potential benefits to be derived from a particular mode of medical therapy against certain risks inherent with such therapy. However, the professional judgment of the attending health professional is the primary component of quality medical care. Because guidelines cannot account for every variation in circumstances, the practitioner must always exercise professional judgment in their application. These Clinical Guidelines are intended to supplement, but not replace, professional training and judgment.</p></div>
