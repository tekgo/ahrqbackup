<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Osteoarthritis can be a debilitating condition. An assessment of patient symptoms and functional status is important as it serves as the basis for making treatment modifications, which in turn, assists in improving the patient's quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>:</p>
<p>Any persistent pain that has an impact on physical function, psychosocial function, or other aspects of quality of life should be recognized as a significant problem. (American Geriatrics Society [AGS], 2002)</p>
<p>Control of pain and maintenance of activity correlate well with satisfactory quality of life. If the patient is not satisfied with the outcome due to continued pain and limitation of activity, more aggressive intervention may be warranted. (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons [AAOS], 2003)</p></div>
