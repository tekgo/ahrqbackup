<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Quality of evidence grades (<strong>high, moderate, low, very low</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>strong, weak, uncertain</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Setting 1: Hospitalized Adult Patients with Therapy-Induced Hypoproliferative Thrombocytopenia</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong></p>
<p>The AABB recommends that platelets should be transfused prophylactically to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding in adult patients with therapy-induced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia.</p>
<p>The AABB recommends transfusing hospitalized adult patients with a platelet count of 10 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L or less to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding.</p>
<p>The AABB recommends transfusing up to a single apheresis unit or equivalent. Greater doses are not more effective, and lower doses equal to one half of a standard apheresis unit are equally effective.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quality of evidence: moderate; strength of recommendation: strong</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Setting 2: Adult Patients Having Minor Invasive Procedures</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong></p>
<p>The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quality of evidence: low; strength of recommendation: weak</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong></p>
<p>The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quality of evidence: very low; strength of recommendation: weak</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Setting 3: Adult Patients Having Major Elective Nonneuraxial Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong></p>
<p>The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having major elective nonneuraxial surgery with a platelet count less than 50 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quality of evidence: very low; strength of recommendation: weak</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong></p>
<p>The AABB recommends against routine prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients who are nonthrombocytopenic and have cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The AABB suggests platelet transfusion for patients having CPB who exhibit perioperative bleeding with thrombocytopenia and/or with evidence of platelet dysfunction.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quality of evidence: very low; strength of recommendation: weak</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Setting 4: Adult Patients Receiving Antiplatelet Therapy Who Have Intracranial Hemorrhage (Traumatic or Spontaneous)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong></p>
<p>The AABB cannot recommend for or against platelet transfusion for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy who have intracranial hemorrhage (traumatic or spontaneous).</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Criteria for Considering Studies for the Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Types of Studies</strong></p>
<p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (prospective or retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and those with no control arm) were eligible for inclusion. Although all observational studies meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed, data from these studies were not used when more than two RCTs addressed a particular question. The use of evidence summaries based only on RCTs was favored due to confounding-by-indication bias in observational transfusion studies: that is, platelet transfusion is often administered based on disease severity.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Participants</strong></p>
<p>Patients undergoing platelet transfusions in RCTs or observational studies were eligible for inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Interventions</strong></p>
<p>Apheresis or whole blood&ndash;derived (buffy coat or platelet-rich plasma) platelet concentrates whether used as therapeutic or prophylactic interventions for any clinical condition were eligible for inclusion. The comparison group (if any) was a medical management strategy without platelet transfusion or, in the case of the platelet dosing or platelet count threshold question, platelet transfusion strategy using a different dose or threshold.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>Outcome measures considered were all-cause mortality, mortality due to bleeding, bleeding ("major" or "significant" bleeding as defined in each study), and number of platelet transfusions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Methods for Identification of Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers searched the Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, and Web of Science databases since inception until September 5, 2014. There was no restriction on eligibility criteria in terms of when the studies were performed or language. They first searched for existing guidelines/systematic reviews using the search filter developed by Haynes and colleagues. References of obtained articles from identified guidelines and systematic reviews were manually scanned to identify other potentially relevant articles for inclusion in the review. Members of the AABB Guidelines Panel were also canvassed to identify potentially eligible unpublished or ongoing studies. When deemed necessary, study authors were contacted for information not available or not well described in the original papers.</p>
<p>See the Appendix S1 in the systematic review supporting information (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and Appendix Table 2 in the original guideline document for a full search strategy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection of Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>All titles, abstracts, and full-text reports were reviewed by two authors of the systematic review; further review was conducted by a third author when there was disagreement about eligibility of the study for inclusion in the review. </p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Data extraction forms were piloted. The final forms were used to extract data in duplicate, and a further review for accuracy was conducted by an independent member of the panel.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Risk of Bias in Included Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>Assessment of the risk of bias in the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was done according to The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias. The risk of bias in observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale, supplemented by the guidance paper by Wells and coworkers. Overall quality of the studies was categorized in four categories according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method (details on GRADE method are provided in Appendix S2, available as supporting information in the online version of this guideline). A formal assessment of publication bias was not performed, since a small number of studies (&lt;10) will typically generate false-negative results.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Measures of Treatment Effect</span></strong></p>
<p>Dichotomous data were summarized using odds ratio (OR) and pooled data using the random-effects model along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cohort and RCT studies. Continuous data were summarized using mean difference or standardized mean difference and reported with 95% CI for both prospective and retrospective studies. Some prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted, but others could not be conducted due to the limited amount of available data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Heterogeneity</span></strong></p>
<p>To evaluate heterogeneity between pooled studies, the I<sup>2</sup> statistic was calculated. The reviewers planned to assess potential sources of heterogeneity by conducting a sensitivity analysis on all aspects of study quality, but the number of studies was too small to allow reliable statistical analysis. Clinical heterogeneity was also assessed according to the PICO (patient, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format. Based on this assessment, the reviewers were generally able to pool data from individual RCTs. For observational studies, data were pooled based on the consensus of three research team members followed by concurrence of the entire panel. RCT data with observational study data were not pooled. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2011, <a href="http://tech.cochrane.org/revman" title="Cochrane Informatics &amp; Knowledge Management Department Web site">http://tech.cochrane.org/revman</a>). A GRADE evidence profile was constructed for all outcomes. Where meta-analysis was not possible, evidence was summarized descriptively.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Clinical Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinical questions were developed by an AABB Guidelines Panel consisting of 21 members. The panel was charged with providing direction for development of the systematic review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), which in turn was used to inform the development of clinical practice guidelines (reported in a separate document). This systematic review was performed according to the standards of The Cochrane Collaboration, using a standardized protocol and reported as per the PRISMA guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>A panel of 21 experts was convened. Fifteen participants were members of the Clinical Transfusion Medicine Committee of the AABB, all of whom were hematologists or pathologists with expertise in transfusion medicine. Five additional panel members included a neurosurgeon, a cardiac surgeon, a critical care specialist, an anesthesiologist, and a hematologist, representing the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and the American Society of Hematology, respectively. The final panel member was a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodologist.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grading of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The GRADE method was used to assess the quality of the evidence and determine the strength of recommendations. The recommendations were developed by consensus at an in-person panel meeting. Panel member judgments on 4 GRADE factors (quality of evidence, balance between the intervention's benefits and harms, resource use, and patient values and preferences) and ratings of the strength of recommendations were validated using an online survey tool 1 week after the meeting.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Platelet transfusion is associated with several risks to the recipient, including allergic reactions and febrile nonhemolytic reactions, bacterial sepsis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, hepatitis B infection, hepatitis C infection, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Sepsis from a bacterially contaminated platelet unit represents the most frequent infectious complication from any blood product today. In any situation where platelet transfusion is being considered, these risks must be balanced against the potential clinical benefits.</p></div>
