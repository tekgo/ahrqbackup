Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of recommendation (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak/conditional</strong>) and levels of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low</strong> or <strong>very low</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pharmacologic Prophylaxis in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome [PICO] Question 1)</span></strong></p>
<p>In children hospitalized after trauma (P), should pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis be utilized (I), compared with no pharmacologic prophylaxis (C), to reduce the incidence of VTE (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation for Pharmacologic Prophylaxis in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 1) </strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors conditionally recommend that pharmacologic prophylaxis be considered for children older than 15 years who are at low risk of bleeding. They also conditionally recommend that pharmacologic prophylaxis be considered for children younger than 15 years old who are post-pubertal if they have an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 25. For prepubertal children, even with ISS greater than 25, the guideline authors conditionally recommend against routine pharmacologic prophylaxis. Further studies are necessary to provide recommendations in prepubertal children. These recommendations are conditional, given the paucity of published data in children and the very low quality of the available evidence. The recommendations are based on data in adults and the relative safety of enoxaparin at prophylactic doses in children (Gould et al., 2012; Bidlingmaier et al., 2011; Stem et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2013).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mechanical VTE Prophylaxis in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 2)</span></strong></p>
<p>In children hospitalized after trauma (P), should mechanical VTE prophylaxis be utilized (I), compared with no prophylaxis or in addition to pharmacologic prophylaxis (C), to reduce the incidence of VTE (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation for Mechanical Prophylaxis in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 2)</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors conditionally recommend that mechanical prophylaxis be considered alone or in addition to pharmacologic prophylaxis to hospitalized children older than 15 years and children younger than 15 years who are post-pubertal if they have an ISS greater than 25 for whom an appropriately sized device is available. This recommendation is conditional, given the paucity of published data in children and the very low quality of the available evidence. The recommendation is based on data in adults and the safety and tolerability of mechanical prophylaxis in children (Gould et al., 2012; Faustino et al., 2014).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Active Ultrasound Surveillance for VTE in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 3)</span></strong></p>
<p>In children hospitalized after trauma (P), should active surveillance for VTE with ultrasound be performed (I), compared with daily physical examination alone (C), to detect VTE earlier (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation for Active Ultrasound Surveillance for VTE in Children Hospitalized after Trauma (PICO Question 3) </strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors conditionally recommend against active surveillance for VTE with ultrasound for earlier detection of VTE compared with routine daily physical examination alone in children hospitalized after trauma. The potential benefits of earlier detection and treatment of VTE are unclear, but the risk of bleeding with therapeutic anticoagulation is well documented.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inclusion Criteria for this Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Study Types</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors included case series, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials. Original studies from meta-analyses and reviews were also included. Case reports, surveys, and letters to the editor were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Participant Type</strong></p>
<p>Any patient 0 to 21 years old who developed venous thromboembolism (VTE) after being hospitalized for trauma was included. Similar children who did not develop VTE were included as control subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Intervention Types</strong></p>
<p>Pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis consisted primarily of low-molecular-weight heparin, particularly enoxaparin, unfractionated heparin, or warfarin. Mechanical prophylaxis consisted of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings. Ultrasound scans of the lower extremities and of insertion sites for central venous catheters were used for active surveillance for VTE. The putative risk factors evaluated were age, severity of injury, presence of central venous catheters, major surgery, site and type of injury (i.e., acute spinal cord, pelvis fracture, femur fracture, head injury, abdominal injury, and chest injury), obesity, mechanical ventilation, use of recombinant factor VIIa, and immobilization.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measure Type</strong></p>
<p>The relevant outcomes were the incidence of VTE for Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Questions 1 and 2 and time to detection of VTE for PICO Question 3. Via consensus, the writing group considered incidence of VTE as a critical outcome and time to detection of VTE an important outcome. Venous thromboembolism was defined as deep vein thrombosis in the extremities and/or pulmonary embolism. For PICO Questions 1 and 2, only symptomatic VTE was included because this was the most consistently reported outcome in pediatric studies. For PICO Question 3, VTE detected by active surveillance with ultrasound, regardless of symptoms, was compared with symptomatic VTE. The authors also used symptomatic VTE as outcome for the review of putative risk factors. Given the paucity of data, other relevant outcomes (e.g., duration of hospitalization, incidence of stroke, mortality rate, duration of anticoagulation, recurrence of VTE, incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome, and costs of care) were not evaluated, even though the writing group considered these as important outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian performed a systematic review of the MEDLINE database using PubMed from January 1946 to July 2015. The search strategies included "venous thromboembolism," "trauma," and "pediatric," with additional subject headings and text words per concept and with added specific terms for "prophylaxis" and "prevention." The search was restricted to humans, availability of full text article, and publication in English language. Only clinical studies in a pediatric trauma population, defined as 21 years or younger, or studies that combined adults and children but had delineated analyses for children were analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Abstracts were reviewed for relevance to the PICO questions of interest by one of the authors. Potentially relevant studies underwent full text review by the entire writing group to determine inclusion. Conflicts were resolved through group consensus.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Number of Source Documents
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The literature search yielded 48 articles (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). A total of 34 articles (71%) were excluded mainly because of study design. There were no randomized controlled trials. Of the included studies, only two addressed, at most partially, the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) questions of interest. A total of 14 studies addressed the putative risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Once the included articles were determined, data on the study type, subject characteristics, presence of putative risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), type of prophylaxis, presence of VTE, and strength of association between exposure, that is, prophylaxis or putative risk factor, and VTE were extracted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). Data were checked in duplicate for accuracy by two members of the writing group assigned to the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) question. Inconsistencies were resolved through full group review of the data and discussion.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Methodological Quality/Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence for each PICO question was assessed by two members of the writing group. Based on the GRADE guidelines, randomized controlled trials and observational studies were initially categorized as having high and low quality, respectively. The category was upgraded or downgraded based on the five core GRADE domains of risk for bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, as well as the size of effect. The quality of evidence for each study was finalized after discussions with the entire writing group. The guideline authors utilized GRADEpro (McMaster University and Evidence Prime Incorporated, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada), an online software, to create summary-of-findings tables for each PICO question.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Measures of Treatment Effect</span></strong></p>
<p>Because of the small number of studies available for each PICO question and significant differences in study design, meta-analysis was not performed, and summary measures of treatment effect were not calculated. Incidence of VTE was presented as counts (%), whereas that for time to detection of VTE was presented as median days. Comparisons for incidence of VTE were performed using Fisher exact test. For the putative risk factors, significant heterogeneity of studies or lack of control subjects prevented calculation of summary measures of effect. Strengths of association were expressed as odds or risk ratios.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Given the rising incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children and the resultant morbidity and excess cost, there is growing impetus for hospitals to institute local pediatric guidelines on VTE prophylaxis, particularly in high-risk populations, such as those hospitalized after trauma. </li>
    <li>Inferred from two studies, the use of mechanical, versus no prophylaxis, suggested a possible reduction on the incidence of VTE. This effect is strengthened by data in adults showing significant reduction in the incidence of VTE after trauma with mechanical prophylaxis. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the "Qualitative Synthesis" and "Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-analysis)" sections of the original guideline document for discussion of evidence related to benefits of specific interventions.</p>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Earlier diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with active ultrasound surveillance may lead to increased use of therapeutic anticoagulation without clear benefit. In adults, active surveillance for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with ultrasounds was not efficacious in reducing the risk of symptomatic VTE. It may, in fact, increase the risk of bleeding with therapeutic anticoagulation for any detected asymptomatic DVT. The risk of major bleeding with therapeutic anticoagulation in children can be as high as 24% with unfractionated heparin and 4% with enoxaparin. In addition, the cost of widespread active surveillance with ultrasound for these uncommon events would need to be considered before general utilization could be recommended.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad Hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
    <li>These guidelines represent a detailed summary of the limited literature regarding venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in children hospitalized after trauma. The available evidence is of very low quality and observational in nature. As such, evidence from adults was considered in the writing group's recommendations. These guidelines are intended to inform the decision-making process rather than replace clinical judgment. </li>
