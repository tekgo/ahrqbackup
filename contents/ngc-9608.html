<h2>Recommendations

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of recommendation (1-3) and classification of evidence (I-III) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Computed tomographic (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis should be considered in all patients with small-bowel obstruction (SBO) because it can provide incremental information over plain films in differentiating grade, severity, and etiology of SBOs that may lead to changes in management. <strong>Level 1</strong>. </li>
    <li>Water-soluble contrast study should be considered in patients who fail to improve after 48 hours of nonoperative management because a normal contrast study can rule out operative SBO. <strong>Level 2</strong>. </li>
    <li>If available, multidetector CT scanner and multiplanar reconstruction should be used because they aid in the diagnosis and localization of SBOs. <strong>Level 3</strong>. </li>
    <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are potential alternatives to computed tomography but may have several logistical limitations. <strong>Level 3</strong>. </li>
    <li>CT scan should be considered to aid in the diagnosis of small-bowel volvulus. Findings include multiple transition points, posterior location, and the "whirl" sign. <strong>Level 3</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Management</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with SBO and generalized peritonitis on physical examination or with other evidence of clinical deterioration such as fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and continuous pain should undergo timely surgical exploration. <strong>Level 1</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients without the previously mentioned clinical picture can safely undergo initial nonoperative management for both partial and complete SBO, although complete obstruction has a higher level of failure. <strong>Level 1</strong>. </li>
    <li>CT findings consistent with bowel ischemia should suggest a low threshold for operative intervention. <strong>Level 2</strong>. </li>
    <li>Laparoscopic treatment of SBO is a viable alternative to laparotomy in selected cases. When successful, it may be associated with decreased morbidity and a shorter length of stay. <strong>Level 2</strong>. </li>
    <li>Water-soluble contrast should be considered in the setting of partial SBO that has not resolved in 48 hours because it can improve bowel function (time to bowel movement), decrease length of stay, and is both therapeutic and diagnostic. <strong>Level 2</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients without resolution of the SBO by days 3 to 5 of nonoperative management should undergo water-soluble contrast study or surgery. <strong>Level 3</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients with SBO should generally be admitted to a surgical service because this has been shown to be associated with a shorter length of stay, less hospital charges, and lower mortality compared with admission to a medical service. <strong>Level 3</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classes of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective, randomized, controlled trials</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Clinical studies in which data were collected prospectively and retrospective analyses that were based on clearly reliable data. Types of studies so classified include observational studies, cohort studies, prevalence studies, and case-control studies.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Studies based on retrospectively collected data. Evidence used in this class includes clinical series, database or registry review, large series of case reviews, and expert opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong>: The recommendation is convincingly justifiable based on the available scientific information alone. This recommendation is usually based on Class I data, however, strong Class II evidence may form the basis for a Level I recommendation, especially if the issue does not lend itself to testing in a randomized format. Conversely, low quality or contradictory Class I data may not be able to support a Level I recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong>: The recommendation is reasonably justifiable by available scientific evidence and strongly supported by expert opinion. This recommendation is usually supported by Class II data or a preponderance of Class III evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong>: The recommendation is supported by available data but adequate scientific evidence is lacking. This recommendation is generally supported by Class III data. This type of recommendation is useful for educational purposes and in guiding future clinical research.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2012 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A computerized search of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database was undertaken using the Entrez interface for English language citations during the period of 2007 through 2011 using the primary search strategy:</p>
<p class="Indent">intestinal obstruction[mh] AND intestine, small[mh] AND humans[mh] NOT (case reports[pt] OR letter[pt] OR comment[pt] OR news[pt])</p>
<p>The primary search identified 259 articles that met our criteria. After the exclusion of review and pediatric and inflammatory bowel disease articles, 53 new articles were identified. These articles detailed both prospective and retrospective studies examining adult patients with suspected or proven SBO. These articles were added to the 131 previous studies reviewed in the 2007 practice management guidelines (see the Appendix in the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A literature search was conducted of OVID and Medline using the keyword and subject headings "small bowel obstruction" and "intestinal obstruction." The list was then limited to adult and human as well as 2012 - 9/2017. Papers were excluded if the title indicated the paper was not relevant (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease or congenital obstruction or large bowel obstruction). Papers were then selected based on review of the abstracts to ensure that the publications met the relevant subject matter which was diagnosis and/or management of adult small bowel obstruction.</p></div>

The Ad hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
