Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>A-C</strong>) and strength of recommendation (strong [grade <strong>1</strong>], weak [grade <strong>2</strong>]) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Prognostic Models</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Repeat biopsy is generally recommended in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients thought to have relapsed, and should be considered in those who have residual fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lesions post-therapy (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET-CT) is the preferred restaging modality after salvage therapy (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The aim of salvage treatment should be to achieve an FDG-PET-negative remission (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Salvage Chemotherapy</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The choice of a first line salvage regimen in patients eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) should be based on patient factors and familiarity of the treatment centre with the regimen (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Regimens containing stem cell toxic agents (such as carmustine and melphalan) should be avoided if possible until stem cells have been successfully collected and cryopreserved if ASCT is planned (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>There is currently no evidence to support intensive sequential induction/consolidation strategies prior to ASCT (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Consider switching to an alternative non-cross-resistant salvage regimen if there are residual FDG-avid lesions after first line salvage treatment and the intent is to proceed to ASCT (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients not eligible for ASCT, combined modality therapy should be considered, especially in early stage relapse and in patients who have not received prior radiotherapy or who have relapsed outside of the initial radiotherapy field (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients unlikely to tolerate the toxicities associated with more intensive regimens, palliation with either a single agent or with a multi-agent oral regimen with or without intravenous vinblastine should be considered (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Early consideration of involvement of palliative care services is recommended, particularly in those not eligible for high dose therapy (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>ASCT is the standard treatment for patients with relapsed disease who achieve an adequate response to salvage therapy (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>ASCT is also the standard treatment for patients with primary resistant disease who achieve an adequate response to salvage therapy (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>ASCT is not recommended in those failing to achieve an adequate response (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>An adequate response to salvage therapy is currently defined as a partial response (PR) by conventional CT criteria (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Choice of conditioning regimen should be based on familiarity of the treatment centre with the regimen (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Current evidence does not support the use of maintenance cytotoxic therapies post-ASCT (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Tandem ASCT cannot currently be recommended outside of clinical trials (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Allogeneic Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Allogeneic transplantation using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen is the treatment of choice for younger patients with a suitable donor and chemo-sensitive disease following failure of ASCT (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>An appropriately human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated donor should be considered when there is no HLA-matched sibling (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>A second autologous transplant is a reasonable clinical option in selected patients with late relapse following ASCT (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Investigation of the use of allogeneic transplantation earlier in the treatment pathway should be performed in the context of prospective clinical trials, but may be justified in selected patients who have required multiple lines of therapy to achieve a response (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Radiotherapy</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The use of radiotherapy should be given serious consideration in cases of local relapse or relapse at sites where local disease is dominating the clinical picture. The use of involved site techniques is recommended to minimize toxicity to normal tissues (for example, lung fields) if subsequent high dose consolidation therapy is planned (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Salvage radiotherapy alone may be considered a reasonable treatment option in selected patients not eligible for ASCT, especially for older patients with relapsed HL who lack B symptoms, have a good performance status, and have limited stage disease at relapse (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In the rare event of late relapse &gt;5 years after primary therapy occurring at a localized site without B symptoms, treatment with standard-dose chemotherapy and involved field radiation alone may be appropriate (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Peri-transplant (ASCT) radiotherapy should be considered in patients that have a dominant site of local relapse at an initially involved site (these are usually patients who have had bulky disease with residual abnormalities following salvage chemotherapy and ASCT) (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence is graded as high (A), moderate (B) or low (C). To put this in context, it is useful to consider the uncertainty of knowledge and whether further research could change what is known or is certain.</p>
<p><strong>(A) High</strong>: Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect. Current evidence derived from randomized clinical trials without important limitations.</p>
<p><strong>(B) Moderate</strong>: Further research may well have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Current evidence derived from randomized clinical trials with important limitations (e.g., inconsistent results, imprecision &ndash; wide confidence intervals or methodological flaws &ndash; e.g., lack of blinding, large losses to follow up, failure to adhere to intention to treat analysis), or very strong evidence from observational studies or case series (e.g., large or very large and consistent estimates of the magnitude of a treatment effect or demonstration of a dose-response gradient).</p>
<p><strong>(C) Low</strong>: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Current evidence from observational studies, case series, or just opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong (grade 1)</strong>: Strong recommendations (grade 1) are made when there is confidence that the benefits do or do not outweigh harm and burden. Grade 1 recommendations can be applied uniformly to most patients. Regard as 'recommend'.</p>
<p><strong>Weak (grade 2)</strong>: Where the magnitude of benefit or not is less certain a weaker grade 2 recommendation is made. Grade 2 recommendations require judicious application to individual patients. Regard as 'suggest'.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Toxicity for the majority of chemotherapy regimens in studies prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) was mainly haematological, with gastrointestinal toxicity also a common feature of some regimens. Mortality from salvage therapy is low, as expected from the young age of the patients and associated lack of co-morbidities. However, the treatment-related mortality reported for the Dexa-BEAM (dexamethasone, carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) regimen was 5% in the German Hodgkin's Lymphoma study group/European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ASCT phase III trial, although it is hard to know if this reflects an intrinsically greater toxicity for this regimen. Given that no recommendations can be made as to the most efficacious regimen, the decision should be tailored to individual patient needs (such as avoiding cisplatin in renal impairment or avoiding ifosfamide in patients at high risk of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy) and using an established regimen which is familiar to the treating centre. </li>
    <li>Overall, salvage radiotherapy is safe and well tolerated with mild to moderate acute reversible side effects including fatigue, anorexia, nausea, skin erythema, and dysphagia. The risks of late toxicity should always be balanced against the risks associated with disease progression in this relapsed and refractory setting by experts in radiotherapy of Hodgkin lymphoma, working within the multidisciplinary team. The risk of late toxicity and second cancer risk is dependent on the site, volume, and type of tissue irradiated, as well as age and sex of the patient. </li>
