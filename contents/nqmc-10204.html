<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Increasing physician awareness of patient exposure to radiation is an important step towards reducing the potentially harmful effects of radiation as a result of imaging studies. One study by Darling et al. (2011) found a significant correlation between documentation of fluoroscopy time by the radiologist in the dictated radiology report and reduced overall fluoroscopy time. Additional studies demonstrate that providing physicians with feedback regarding their fluoroscopy time leads to a reduction in average fluoroscopy times (Ngo et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2013). </p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and other references</strong>:</p>
<p>All available radiation dose data should be recorded in the patient's medical record. If cumulative air kerma (Ka,r) or air kerma-area-product (PKA) data are not available, the fluoroscopic exposure time and the number of acquired images (radiography, cine, or digital subtraction angiography) should be recorded in the patient's medical record. (American College of Radiology [ACR], 2013).</p>
<p>For the present, and for the purpose of this guideline, adequate recording of dose metrics is defined as documentation in the patient record of at least one of the following for all interventional procedures requiring fluoroscopy (in descending order of desirability): skin dose mapping, peak skin dose (PSD), Ka,r, PKA, and fluoroscopic time/number of fluorographic images. Note, however, that this is adequate recording; this document recommends recording of all available dose metrics (Miller et al., 2012).</p>
<p>ACR should now encourage practices to record actual fluoroscopy time for all fluoroscopic procedures. The fluoroscopy time for various procedures (e.g., upper gastrointestinal, pediatric voiding cystourethrography, diagnostic angiography) should then be compared with benchmark figures...More complete patient radiation dose data should be recorded for all high-dose interventional procedures, such as embolizations, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, and arterial angioplasty or stent placement anywhere in the abdomen and pelvis (Amis et al., 2007).</p>
<p>Measure &amp; record patient radiation dose:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Record fluoroscopy time </li>
    <li>Record available measures &ndash; dose area product (DAP), cumulative dose, skin dose (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2005). </li>
</ul></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
As imaging technology continues to advance, the United States healthcare system has seen an increase in both the type and frequency of imaging studies being performed. The increase in utilization of imaging studies is accompanied by a corresponding increase in cost and exposure to radiation for both patients and healthcare professionals. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the number of radiologic procedures performed in the United States showed a ten-fold increase while the annual per-capita effective dose from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures increased by 600% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, the number of computerized tomographic (CT) examinations tripled, while the number of ultrasounds nearly doubled (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine, and ultrasound) accounted for approximately 35% of all imaging studies (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the proportion of radiation exposure that is attributable to medical sources increased from 17% to 53% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, while CT scans only accounted for approximately 17% of all radiologic procedures performed in the United States, they accounted for over 65% of the total effective radiation dose from radiologic procedures (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, the estimated per-capita effective radiation dose for radiologic procedures in the United States was nearly 20% higher than the average for other well-developed countries (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic imaging was prioritized as a topic area for measure development due to a high level of utilization, rising costs, and the need for measures to help promote appropriate use of imaging and improve outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
Studies have demonstrated a general lack of awareness among physicians and radiologists of the relative doses of various imaging studies (Lee et al., 2004; Puri et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2006). In one study by Lee et al. (2004), only 22% of emergency department physicians and 13% of radiologists were able to give an accurate estimate of the radiation dose of a CT scan as compared to a chest radiograph. Additionally, studies (Ritter et al., 2013; Jorgensen et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011; Uradomo, Lustberg, &amp; Darwin, 2006) have shown that fluoroscopy time for a given imaging study varies from physician to physician based on a variety of factors including gender and level of experience. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a measure testing project in 2011 with Telligen to ensure four radiology measures were reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator, and exception case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing electronic health record data and claims data. Inter-rater reliability was tested. Three sites in three states participated in the testing of the measures. All three sites were in urban settings. Site A was a group practice with 10 physicians. Site B was a hospital-based group practice with 90 physicians. Site C was a hospital-based practice with greater than 1000 physicians.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong><br />
The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from chart records were used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the measures. </p>
<p>Some of the measures in this set are being made available without any prior testing. The PCPI recognizes the importance of testing all of its measures and encourages testing of the diagnostic imaging measurement set for feasibility and reliability by organizations or individuals positioned to do so. The <em>Measure Testing Protocol for PCPI Measures</em> was approved by the PCPI in 2010 and is available on the PCPI Web site (see Position Papers at <a href="http://www.physicianconsortium.org" title="PCPI Web site">www.physicianconsortium.org</a>); interested parties are encouraged to review this document and to contact PCPI staff. The PCPI will welcome any opportunity to promote the initial testing of these measures and to ensure that any results available from testing are used to refine the measures before implementation. </p></div>
