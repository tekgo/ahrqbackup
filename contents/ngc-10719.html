Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>+OOO</strong>, <strong>++OO</strong>, <strong>+++O</strong>, and <strong>++++</strong>); the strength of the recommendation (<strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong>); and the difference between a "recommendation" and a "suggestion" are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis of Androgen Deficiency</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against making a clinical diagnosis of androgen deficiency syndrome in healthy women because there is a lack of a well-defined syndrome, and data correlating androgen levels with specific signs or symptoms are unavailable (<strong>1</strong>|<strong>++OO</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Generalized Treatment of Women with Testosterone (T) or Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against the generalized use of T by women for infertility; sexual dysfunction (except for a specific diagnosis of hypoactive sexual desire disorder [HSDD]; see the recommendation under "Testosterone Therapy for Women with HSDD" below), cognitive dysfunction, cardiovascular dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, bone health, or well-being. There are no clear indications for these uses, and evidence of safety in long-term studies is lacking (<strong>1</strong>|<strong>++OO</strong>). In addition, government agency&ndash;approved and monitored dose-appropriate preparations are not widely available.</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against the generalized use of DHEA for women because the indications are inadequate, and evidence of efficacy and long-term safety are lacking (<strong>1</strong>|<strong>++OO</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of Women with Low Androgen Levels</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against the routine treatment of women with low androgen levels due to hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, bilateral oophorectomy, or other conditions associated with low androgen levels because of the lack of adequate data supporting efficacy and/or long term safety (<strong>1</strong>|<strong>+OOO</strong>).</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against routinely measuring T in women for diagnosis, because a correlation between symptoms and T levels has not been established (<strong>1</strong>|<strong>+OOO</strong>).</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends against the routine use of DHEA therapy in women with adrenal insufficiency because data concerning its effectiveness and safety are limited (<strong>1</strong>|<strong>+OOO</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">T Therapy for Women with HSDD</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests a 3- to 6-month trial of a dose of T for postmenopausal women who request therapy for properly diagnosed HSDD and in whom therapy is not contraindicated resulting in a midnormal premenopausal value in a reference assay to avoid pharmacological T administration (<strong>2</strong>|<strong>++OO</strong>).</p>
<p>If T therapy is prescribed, the Task Force suggests measuring T levels at baseline and after 3 to 6 weeks of initial treatment to assess patient overuse (<strong>2</strong>|<strong>++OO</strong>).</p>
<p>In cases of ongoing T therapy, the Task Force suggests reviewing T levels every 6 months to monitor for excessive use and signs of androgen excess (<strong>2</strong>|<strong>++OO</strong>).</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests cessation of T therapy for women who have not responded to treatment by 6 months (<strong>2</strong>|<strong>++OO</strong>). No safety and efficacy data for T therapy are available after 24 months (see Table 1 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Androgen Therapy and Monitoring</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests against the treatment of women with T preparations formulated for men or those formulated by pharmacies due to a lack of data concerning efficacy and safety of these preparations in women (<strong>2</strong>|<strong>+OOO</strong>).</p>
<p>If a woman is to be given a trial of T therapy, the Task Force suggests checking baseline T level and the use of an approved non-oral preparation for women (such as a transdermal patch, gel, or cream) if such a treatment is available (<strong>2</strong>|<strong>+OOO</strong>).</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests monitoring T levels 3 to 6 weeks after initiation of therapy and every 6 months thereafter to assess for patient overuse or signs of androgen excess (<strong>2</strong>|<strong>+OOO</strong>).</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests cessation of therapy for women who have not responded to treatment by 6 months. Safety and efficacy data for T therapy in women are not available beyond 24 months (<strong>2</strong>|<strong>+OOO</strong>).</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Endocrine Society's Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews of published data (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials to support the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Benefits and Harms of Systemic Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in Postmenopausal Women With Normal Adrenal Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled women with surgical or natural menopause and normal adrenal function who were assigned to receive systemic DHEA or placebo and evaluated the outcomes of interest. Trials were included regardless of their size or duration of patient follow-up.</p>
<p>Outcomes of interest were: quality of life and general well-being, sexual function, psychological symptoms related to menopause, lipid profile, glucose tolerance, body measurements, and bone health.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>An expert reference librarian designed and conducted the electronic search strategy with input from study investigators with expertise in conducting systematic reviews. The search involved multiple databases including MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus, from their inception through January 2014. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for DHEA therapy for postmenopausal women, limited to RCTs. Reviewers also searched the bibliographies of the included studies to identify any candidate studies that might be missed by the electronic search. Content experts from The Endocrine Society were also queried for potential references.</p>
<p>The full search strategy is provided in the Supplemental Data for the systematic review.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>All relevant abstracts were downloaded into an Endnote library and uploaded to an online reference management system (DistillerSR; Evidence Partners Inc.). Reviewers working independently and in duplicate screened the abstracts for eligibility. Disagreements from this level were automatically upgraded to the next level of screening. Full text of eligible abstracts were retrieved and screened in duplicate. Disagreements at this level were resolved by consensus. The guideline developers calculated the inter-reviewer agreement beyond chance (kappa) during the full-text screening level.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Benefits and Harms of Systemic Testosterone Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With Normal Adrenal Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers included RCTs that enrolled postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function who were assigned to testosterone (T) therapy with or without estrogen and compared to either estrogens alone or placebo. The outcomes included sexual function, psychological symptoms, bone health, body measurements, lipid profile, and incidence of hirsutism and acne.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The search strategy was developed by a reference librarian, who received input from the study's principal investigator in compliance with the protocol and the predefined criteria. Several databases were searched, including MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO CINAHL, and Scopus. These databases were searched from July 2008 to January 2014. Eligible studies prior to July 2008 were identified from previous Endocrine Society guidelines, from a previously published systematic review addressing the same question by the Cochrane collaboration, and from a review about T without hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). The first author searched the reference sections of the included studies to identify other eligible studies that could have been missed by the electronic search. Experts from The Endocrine Society were contacted to verify the final list and identify any missing studies.</p>
<p>The full search strategy is provided in the Supplemental Data for the systematic review.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Relevant studies were screened and selected using DistillerSR (Evidence Partners Inc.), which is a web-based software specifically designed to conduct systematic reviews. References were screened in duplicate, and conflicts were included for full-text review. Full-text screening was also conducted in duplicate, and conflicts were resolved by consensus. Reviewers calculated the chance adjusted inter-reviewer agreement using kappa statistic.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Endocrine Society's Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews of published data (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials to support the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Benefits and Harms of Systemic Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in Postmenopausal Women With Normal Adrenal Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Data were extracted in duplicates using a standardized, piloted, web-based form. For each study, the guideline developers abstracted the following descriptive data: detailed description of baseline characteristics of the participants (i.e., age, ethnicity, and patient's description at baseline) and study characteristics (i.e., location and setting, follow-up duration, and interventions). A third reviewer compared the reviewers' entered data and resolved inconsistencies by referring to the full text of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Author Contact</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers contacted the authors of the original studies when data required for analysis were missing or when more clarification was needed. Author contact was done by e-mail. If they did not receive any response, another e-mail was sent 2 weeks later.</p>
<p><strong>Methodological Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of each randomized controlled trial (RCT) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool. The guideline developers determined the following: how the randomization sequence was generated; how allocation was concealed; whether there were important imbalances at baseline; which groups were blinded (patients, caregivers, data collectors, outcome assessors, data analysts); whether there were any baseline imbalances; whether the analysis was by intention to treat; and how the patients adhered to the assigned medication. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Meta-analysis was done using random effect meta-analysis described by DerSimonian and Laird to account for the heterogeneity between studies as well as within-study variability. Effect sizes were pooled using weighted difference in means (WMD) when outcomes were measured using the same scale and using the standardized mean difference (SMD) when outcomes were measured using multiple scales. Between-study inconsistency was measured by <em>I<sup>2</sup></em> statistics, which estimate the proportion of variation in results across studies that is not due to chance. The Task Force planned to assess publication bias using the Egger regression asymmetry test and visual inspection using funnel plots whenever they had an adequate number of studies and low heterogeneity. Due to multiple testing, the Task Force implemented the false discovery rate controlled procedures proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg and set the <em>P</em> value for significance at .015 instead of the usual .05. All analyses were conducted using STATA, version 12.1 (StataCorp LP).</p>
<p><strong>Subgroup Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force conducted subgroup analyses, which were determined a priori, to explain between-study heterogeneity. These subgroups were based on the length of follow-up (&lt;12 mo vs &ge;12 mo) and study design (parallel vs crossover). For each subgroup analysis, the Task Force conducted a test for interaction (<em>P</em> &lt;.015 was considered to be statistically significant).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Benefits and Harms of Systemic Testosterone Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With Normal Adrenal Function: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Reviewers, working independently and in pairs, used a piloted and comprehensive data form to extract the following information from each study: patient demographic data, eligibility criteria, and details about intervention and the outcomes of interest. The outcomes extracted included: 1) sexual function, namely the number of satisfying sexual episodes, frequency of sexual activity, libido, orgasm, arousal, pleasure or enjoyment of sex, sexual responsiveness, sexual self-image, sexual or relationship satisfaction, and sexual concern; 2) psychological symptoms including personal distress, anxiety or fear, and depressed mood; 3) body measurements including body weight and body mass index (BMI); 4) bone health as measured by spine, hip, and total body bone mineral density (BMD); 5) lipid profile data, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and 6) androgenic side effects, including acne and hirsutism.</p>
<p><strong>Author Contact</strong></p>
<p>When the data were not available in the published articles or a further clarification was needed, the reviewers contacted the authors by e-mail. If there was no response, a repeat e-mail was sent in 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias Assessment</strong></p>
<p>To assess the quality of the included study, the reviewers used Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias assessment tool. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of randomization methods, allocation concealment, baseline imbalances, whether blinding was done adequately and who was blinded, monitoring of adherence to the medication use, and whether analysis was done by intention-to-treat. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE methods.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Meta-analysis was done using the random effect described by DerSimonian and Laird. The reviewers pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, the Task Force calculated the WMD along with the 95% CI. When the studies used different scales to assess the outcomes, they calculated SMD. Heterogeneity was evaluated by the I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Whenever appropriate (more than 10 to 20 studies and low between-study heterogeneity), the reviewers assessed publication bias using the Egger regression asymmetry test and visual inspection of funnel plots. To avoid the potential false positive differences due to multiple outcomes and multiple testing, they adopted the false discovery rate-controlled procedures proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg and set the <em>P</em> value for significance at .015 instead of the usual .05.</p>
<p>All analyses were conducted using STATA, version 12.1 (StataCorp LP).</p></div>

Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict-of-interest review process for the development of clinical practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest, which are reviewed before the members are approved to serve on the Task Force and periodically during the development of the guideline. The conflict-of-interest forms are vetted by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee before the members are approved by the Society's Council to participate on the guideline Task Force. Participants in the guideline development must include a majority of individuals without conflict of interest in the matter under study. Participants with conflicts of interest may participate in the development of the guideline, but they must have disclosed all conflicts. The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any amount from the commercial interest(s) in the form of grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership interest (e.g., stocks, stock options, or ownership interest excluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or other payments for participation in speakers' bureaus, advisory boards, or boards of directors; or other financial benefits. Completed forms are available through The Endocrine Society office.</p>
