<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendation (<strong>A-C</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is no role for the prophylactic use of any tocolytic agent in women with multifetal gestations, including the prolonged use of betamimetics for this indication. </li>
    <li>Progesterone treatment does not reduce the incidence of spontaneous preterm birth in unselected women with twin or triplet gestations and, therefore, is not recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Because of the increased rate of complications associated with monochorionicity, determination of chorionicity by late first trimester or early second trimester in pregnancy is important for counseling and management of women with multifetal gestations. </li>
    <li>Interventions, such as prophylactic cerclage, prophylactic tocolytics, prophylactic pessary, routine hospitalization, and bed rest, have not been proved to decrease neonatal morbidity or mortality and, therefore, should not be used in women with multifetal gestations. </li>
    <li>Magnesium sulfate reduces the severity and risk of cerebral palsy in surviving infants if administered when birth is anticipated before 32 weeks of gestation, regardless of fetal number. </li>
    <li>Women with one previous low transverse cesarean delivery, who are otherwise appropriate candidates for twin vaginal delivery, may be considered candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery. </li>
    <li>Women who underwent pregnancy reduction from triplets to twins, as compared with those who continued with triplets, were observed to have lower frequencies of pregnancy loss, antenatal complications, preterm birth, low-birth-weight infants, cesarean delivery, and neonatal deaths, with rates similar to those observed in women with spontaneously conceived twin gestations. </li>
    <li>Unless a contraindication exists, one course of antenatal corticosteroids should be administered to all patients who are between 24 weeks and 34 weeks of gestation and at risk of delivery within 7 days, irrespective of the fetal number. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Women with uncomplicated monochorionic&ndash;monoamniotic twin gestations can undergo delivery at 32 to 34 weeks of gestation. </li>
    <li>In diamniotic twin pregnancies at 32 0/7 weeks of gestation or later with a presenting fetus that is vertex, regardless of the presentation of the second twin, vaginal delivery is a reasonable option and should be considered, provided that an obstetrician with experience in internal podalic version and vaginal breech delivery is available. </li>
    <li>All women with multifetal gestations, regardless of age, are candidates for routine aneuploidy screening. </li>
    <li>The administration of neuraxial analgesia in women with multifetal gestations facilitates operative vaginal delivery, external or internal cephalic version, and total breech extraction. </li>
    <li>Women with monoamniotic twin gestations should be delivered via cesarean. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case&ndash;control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence.</p>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 1990 and October 2013. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the ACOG were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician-gynecologists were used.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Several limitations must be considered when screening for aneuploidy in multifetal gestations. Serum screening tests are not as sensitive in women with twin or triplet gestations compared with singleton gestations, in part because analyte levels must be estimated by mathematical modeling. In addition, analytes from the normal and the affected fetuses enter the maternal serum and are in effect averaged together, thus potentially masking the abnormal levels of the affected fetus. </li>
    <li>In women with twin gestations, first-trimester screening that combines maternal age, nuchal translucency, and biochemistry serum analytes identifies approximately 75% to 85% of pregnancies with Down syndrome and 66.7% of pregnancies with trisomy 18, with a 5% false-positive rate. </li>
    <li>Hospitals that elect to use magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection should develop uniform and specific guidelines for their departments regarding inclusion criteria, treatment regimens, concurrent tocolysis, and monitoring in accordance with one of the larger trials. </li>
