<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Outpatient same-day surgery is exceedingly common in the United States. Unanticipated hospital visits following same-day surgery reflect quality of care. While most outpatient surgery is safe, there are well-described and potentially preventable adverse events that occur after outpatient surgery, which can result in unanticipated hospital visits. Similarly, direct admissions after surgery that are primarily caused by non-clinical patient considerations, such as lack of transport home upon discharge, or facility logistical issues, such as delayed start of surgery, are common causes of unanticipated yet preventable hospital admissions following same-day surgery. A quality measure of hospital visits following outpatient same-day surgery can improve transparency, inform patients and providers, and foster quality improvement.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Due to advances in surgical and anesthetic techniques, nearly 70% of all surgical procedures in the United States (U.S.) are now performed in the outpatient setting (Cullen, Hall, &amp; Golosinskiy, 2009), with many of these performed at hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) as same-day surgeries (Russo et al., 2006). Same-day surgery offers significant patient benefits as compared with inpatient surgery, including shorter waiting times, avoidance of hospitalizations, and rapid return home (Lemos, Jarrett, &amp; Phillip, 2006). Furthermore, same-day surgery costs significantly less than an equivalent inpatient surgery and therefore presents a significant cost saving opportunity to the health system (Lemos, Jarrett, &amp; Phillip, 2006). With the ongoing shift towards outpatient surgery, assessing the quality of surgical care provided by HOPDs has become increasingly important. </li>
    <li>A hospital visit following same-day surgery is an unexpected and potentially preventable outcome for patients who have a low anticipated risk. In the literature reported, hospital visit rates following surgery vary from 0.5% to 9.0% based on the type of surgery, outcome measured (admissions alone or admissions and emergency department [ED] visits), and timeframe for measurement after surgery (Majholm et al., 2012; Linares-Gil et al., 1997; Fleisher et al. 2004; Coley et al, 2002; Hollingsworth et al., 2012; Bain et al., 1999; Fortier, Chung, &amp; Su, 1998; Aldwinckle &amp; Montgomery, 2004). These hospital visits can occur due to a range of well-described adverse events, including major adverse events such as bleeding, wound infection, septicemia, and venous thromboembolism. Patients also frequently report minor adverse events such as uncontrolled pain, nausea, and vomiting that may result in unplanned hospitalization following surgery. Furthermore, admissions for primarily non-clinical reasons, such as lack of transport home, and admissions for logistical issues, such as delayed start of surgery, are common causes of unanticipated and potentially avoidable hospital admissions following same-day surgery. </li>
    <li>Hospital visit rates vary among HOPDs, suggesting variation in surgical care quality among HOPDs (Bain et al., 2007). </li>
</ul>

Using a 20% sample of Medicare data from 2010, the national observed rate of hospital visits following same-day surgery at hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) was 10.0%. The facility-level risk-standardized hospital visit ratio (RSHVR) showed significant variation. Using bootstrapping techniques, CMS constructed 95% interval estimates (similar to confidence intervals) and used the estimates to place HOPDs into three performance categories: worse than expected, no different than expected, and better than expected. Based on this technique they categorized 80 HOPDs as worse than expected, 4,119 as no different than expected, and 35 as better than expected.</p></div>

Outpatient same-day surgeries performed at hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients aged 65 years and older with the exception of eye surgeries and same day surgeries performed concurrently with high-risk procedures</p>
<p><em>Included Populations</em>: The target population is Medicare FFS patients aged 65 years and older undergoing same-day surgery (those that do not typically require an overnight stay) at HOPDs. The measure is limited to patients who have been enrolled in Part A and Part B Medicare for the 12 months prior to the date of surgery to ensure adequate data for identifying comorbidities for risk adjustment. </p>
<p>The measure includes surgeries for which a physician claim identifies a qualifying surgery as having been performed in an outpatient setting, and matches to a hospital facility claim to identify the HOPD where the surgery took place. Surgeries for which a facility claim is not filed are not included in the measure cohort.</p>
<p>"Same-day surgeries" are substantive surgeries listed on Medicare's list of covered ambulatory surgery center (ASC) procedures. The lists are posted on the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ASCPayment/11_Addenda_Updates.html" title="Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Web site" target="_blank">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Web site</a>.</p>
<p>The measure cohort does not include eye surgeries. Although eye surgery is considered a substantive surgery, its risk profile is more representative of "minor" surgery, in that it is characterized by high volume and a low outcome. The CMS includes cystoscopy with intervention because it is a common procedure, often performed for therapeutic intervention by surgical teams, and our preliminary analysis indicated an outcome rate and causes of hospital visits post-procedure similar to other surgeries in the measure cohort. Where multiple procedures occur concurrently, CMS only includes surgeries that are performed concurrently with another low to moderate risk procedure. CMS does not include same-day surgeries performed concurrently with a higher risk procedure such as an inpatient-only surgery. Refer to the original measure documentation and the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?cid=1228776203288&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;c=Page" title="QualityNet Web site">2016 Measure Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital Visits after Hospital Outpatient Surgery Measure (Risk-standardized Hospital Visits within 7 Days after Hospital Outpatient Surgery Measure)</a></em> for additional details (see the "Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Surgeries for patients without continuous enrollment in Medicare FFS Parts A and B in the 7 days after the surgery. The measure excludes these patients to ensure all patients have full data available for outcome assessment. </li>
    <li>Surgeries for patients who have an emergency department (ED) visit on the same day but billed on a separate claim, unless ED visit has a diagnosis indicative of a complication of care. The measure excludes these surgeries because the sequence of events in not clear. However, the measure does not exclude surgeries with same-day, separate-claim ED visits if the diagnoses are indicative of a complication of care because we want to continue to capture these outcomes. </li>

The outcome is all-cause unplanned hospital visits, defined as 1) an inpatient admission directly after the surgery or 2) an unplanned hospital visit (emergency department [ED] visit, observation stay, or unplanned inpatient admission) occurring after discharge from the hospital outpatient department (HOPD) and within 7 days of the outpatient surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Admissions identified as planned by the planned admission algorithm are not counted in the outcome. The "algorithm" is a set of criteria for classifying admissions as planned using Medicare claims. The algorithm identifies admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 7 days of an outpatient colonoscopy. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) based the planned admission algorithm on three principles: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>
    <li>Otherwise, a planned admission is defined as a non-acute admission for a scheduled procedure; and </li>
    <li>Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned. </li>
</ol>
<p>The planned admission algorithm uses a flowchart and four tables of procedures and conditions to operationalize these principles and to classify inpatient admissions as planned. ED visits and observation stays are never considered planned. The flowchart and tables are available in the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?cid=1228776203288&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;c=Page" title="QualityNet Web site">2016 Measure Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital Visits after Hospital Outpatient Surgery Measure (Risk-standardized Hospital Visits within 7 Days after Hospital Outpatient Surgery Measure)</a></em> (see the "Companion Documents" field).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The approach to risk adjustment is tailored to, and appropriate for, a publicly reported outcome measure as articulated in published scientific guidelines. </p>
<p>The measure uses a two-level hierarchical logistic regression model to estimate risk-standardized hospital visit ratio (RSHVRs). This approach accounts for the clustering of patients within hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) and variation in sample size. </p>
<p>The risk-adjustment model has 25 patient-level variables (age and 24 comorbidity variables) and 2 surgical complexity variables. With the exception of morbid obesity, which is defined using an individual International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code, we define comorbidity variables using CMS Condition Categories (CCs), which are clinically meaningful groupings of many thousands of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. Certain CCs are considered possible complications of care and are not risk-adjusted for if they only occur at the surgery. See the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?cid=1228776203288&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;c=Page" title="QualityNet Web site">2016 Measure Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital Visits after Hospital Outpatient Surgery Measure (Risk-standardized Hospital Visits within 7 Days after Hospital Outpatient Surgery Measure)</a></em> (see the "Companion Document" field) for CCs that are considered possible complications of care and are not risk-adjusted for if they only occur at the surgery. </p>
<p>The measure risk adjusts for surgical procedural complexity using two variables. First, it adjusts for surgical procedural complexity using the Work Relative Value Unit (RVU) of the procedure. Work RVUs are assigned to each Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code and approximate surgical procedural complexity by incorporating elements of physician time and effort. For patients with multiple concurrent CPT procedure codes, we risk adjust for the CPT code with the highest Work RVU value. Second, it classifies each surgery into an anatomical body system group using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Classification System (CCS). The measure uses the body system variable, in addition to the Work RVU of the surgery, to account for organ-specific difference in risk and complications which are not adequately captured by the Work RVU alone. This approach to risk adjustment for surgical procedural complexity is similar to that described in the literature and used for risk adjustment in the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. The coding list for the body systems is available on the <a href="https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp" title="AHRQ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Web site">AHRQ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Web site</a>.</p>
