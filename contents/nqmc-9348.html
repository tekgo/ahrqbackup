<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of clinicians in the clinic who work with patients age 18 years and older who have education and training regarding palliative care concepts.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve the effectiveness and comfort level of the primary care clinician in communicating the necessity and benefits of palliative care with those patients with a serious illness.</p>
<p>Clinicians provide palliative care through effective management of pain and other distressing symptoms, while incorporating psychosocial and spiritual care according to patient and family needs, values, beliefs and culture(s) (Lorenz et al., 2008). The National Consensus Project (2013), National Quality Forum (2012) and the Joint Commission have outlined systematic components of palliative care services to support these outcomes. By intervening at the onset of a serious illness, health care professionals can assure that appropriate interventions are offered to meet the goal of reducing the burden of disease and maximizing the quality of life.</p>
<p>Many clinicians believe they lack confidence and experience in discussing with patients the issues and decisions that come with having a serious illness &ndash; specifically recommendations about palliative care and hospice services. This may involve delivering "bad news," as well as answering questions that may not have specific answers.</p>
<p>In the absence of more formal education, the more a clinician prepares for discussions surrounding palliative care and puts that preparation into practice, the more skilled and comfortable that clinician can become in this aspect of medical care.</p></div>

Financial Disclosures/Other Potential Conflicts of Interest

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) has long had a policy of transparency in declaring potential conflicting and competing interests of all individuals who participate in the development, revision and approval of ICSI guidelines and protocols. </p>
<p>In 2010, the ICSI Conflict of Interest Review Committee was established by the Board of Directors to review all disclosures and make recommendations to the board when steps should be taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, including recommendations regarding removal of work group members. This committee has adopted the Institute of Medicine Conflict of Interest standards as outlined in the report Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2011). </p>
<p>Where there are work group members with identified potential conflicts, these are disclosed and discussed at the initial work group meeting. These members are expected to recuse themselves from related discussions or authorship of related recommendations, as directed by the Conflict of Interest committee or requested by the work group.</p>
