<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>After the full advisory committee has given their input and any recommended changes are made, the third draft guideline is posted on the web and distributed via a provider listserv for public review and comment. </li>
    <li>Once all public comments are received and reviewed, responses are provided by the subcommittee. Both comments and responses are posted on the web. </li>
    <li>The subcommittee may make further revisions to the draft guideline based on public input and any other information they have received. This then results in a fourth draft. </li>
    <li>The fourth draft is presented to the full advisory committee in an open public meeting. Oral comments are invited from the public, and the full committee may recommend further changes, potentially creating a fifth and final draft. </li>
    <li>Once the full committee makes the advisory recommendation to adopt the guideline, it becomes final and is again posted on the web and distributed via the provider listserv. </li>
    <li>Labor &amp; Industries (L&amp;I) then posts on the web a Provider Bulletin announcing the new or revised guideline and distributes it via the provider listserv. </li>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate authorization of shoulder surgeries by the utilization review team and claim adjudicators, leading to better outcomes for workers with shoulder injuries </li>
    <li>One anticipated benefit is decreasing surgical procedures that are unnecessary to the health of the worker, such as distal claviculectomies routinely done with rotator cuff repairs. The diagnostic criteria will help ensure that surgery is performed when there is clear evidence that it will be of benefit. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Care must be exercised when giving a corticosteroid injection to a partial rotator cuff tear, as this may lead to tear extension. Because corticosteroid use is associated with side effects such as weakening of connective tissue, no more than 3 injections are recommended under one claim for the shoulder, 4 injections per lifetime.</p></div>

<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Smoking/nicotine use is a strong relative contraindication for rotator cuff surgery. </li>
    <li>Revision rotator cuff surgery should not be done if a patient has a massive rotator cuff tear (i.e., tears &gt;3 cm or with severe fatty infiltration). </li>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In order for a shoulder condition to be allowed as an occupational disease, the provider must document that the work exposures created a risk of contracting or worsening the condition relative to the risks in everyday life, on a more-probable-than-not basis.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Most guidelines are implemented within the utilization review (UR) program. Labor and Industries (L&amp;I) guidelines have priority over other proprietary guidelines and criteria that may exist. Where L&amp;I guidelines are not available, proprietary ones may be used. Reviewers apply each guideline as a standard for the majority of requests in the Washington workers' compensation program. For the minority of workers who appear to fall outside of the guideline and whose complexity of clinical findings exceeds the specificity of the guideline, further review by a physician is conducted.</p>
<p>When a surgical procedure is requested for a patient who meets the guideline criteria, the reviewer will recommend approval to the claim manager. If the criteria are not met, the request will be referred to a physician consultant who will review the patient's file, offer to discuss the case with the requesting physician, and make a recommendation to the claim manager. The flexibility built into this decision making process is important in two ways. First, it enables the Washington State Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee (IIMAC) to develop surgical indications fairly quickly. Second, it plays a major role in legitimizing the work of the subcommittee in the eyes of practicing physicians in Washington.</p>
<p>Completed guidelines will be communicated to practicing physicians via L&amp;I's website and through its provider listserv (<a href="http://www.lni.wa.gov/Main/Listservs/Provider.asp" title="WSDLI Web site" target="_blank">http://www.lni.wa.gov/Main/Listservs/Provider.asp</a>). Education and training will be provided to reviewers and staff to ensure their proper application within the UR program. Where possible, continuing medical education (CME) credits may be offered.</p></div>
