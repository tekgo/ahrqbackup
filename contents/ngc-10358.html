<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Existing data do not support a consistent relationship between abnormal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integrity and reproductive outcomes </li>
    <li>At present, the results of sperm DNA integrity testing alone do not predict pregnancy rates achieved through natural conception or with intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). However, further re-search may lead to validation of the clinical utility of these tests. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of sperm DNA integrity tests in the evaluation and treatment of the infertile couple (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong>: There is good evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong>: There is fair evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong>: There is insufficient evidence to support a recommendation, either for or against.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A systematic literature search was performed using the search strategy: sperm AND (DNA OR chromatin) AND (fragmentation OR damage OR integrity) AND (pregnancy [title/abstract] OR embryo [title/abstract]) AND (Humans [mesh] AND English [language]) (204 citations). The search was restricted to MEDLINE citations published in the English language from 1966 to November 2011. Studies were eligible if they met one of the following criteria: primary evidence (clinical trials) that assessed the predictive potential using predictive statistics, meta-analyses, and relevant articles from bibliographies of identified articles.</p></div>

Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Level I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of the Sperm Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Integrity Testing Literature</strong></p>
<p>Review articles found during the comprehensive literature search were excluded, while meta analyses were included in the review. Twenty studies used the deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay to assess deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integrity while 28 employed the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) test. The single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (COMET) test was used in 9 papers while the sperm chromatin dispersion test (SCD) test was used in 5. Less commonly used assays were assessed in 5 or fewer publications.</p>
<p>Overall, there are no Level I studies as would be expected for a predictive diagnostic clinical test. In addition, there are few high-quality prospective studies recruiting consecutive patients validating previously established cut-points with gold standard fertility outcomes. Most studies present Level II-2 evidence or less. The majority of studies are hindered by small sample size, non-consecutive recruitment of patients, variable patient populations, lack of control for female factors (particularly age), weak statistical methodology in calculating threshold values and predictive ability of tests, and use of several different methods for assessing DNA damage.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For a diagnostic test to be clinically useful the results must be reproducible, applicable to a given patient, and change the management of the patient. For tests of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integrity to be clinically important there must be an association of sperm DNA damage with reproductive outcomes. The literature was reviewed to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Does the DNA integrity test predict male fertility with natural conception? </li>
    <li>Does the DNA integrity test predict pregnancy with intrauterine insemination (IUI)? </li>
    <li>Is DNA fragmentation predictive of pregnancy with in vitro fertilization (IVF)? </li>
    <li>Is DNA fragmentation predictive of pregnancy with IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)? </li>
    <li>Is DNA fragmentation predictive of pregnancy loss? </li>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although this document reflects appropriate management of a problem encountered in the practice of reproductive medicine, it is not intended to be the only approved standard of practice or to dictate an exclusive course of treatment. Other plans of management may be appropriate, taking into account the needs of the individual patient, available resources, and institutional or clinical practice limitations. </li>
    <li>Sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage is more common in infertile men and may contribute to poor reproductive performance. However, current methods for assessing sperm DNA integrity do not reliably predict treatment outcomes and cannot be recommended routinely for clinical use. </li>
