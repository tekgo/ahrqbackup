Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of imaging studies for patients aged 18 years and older with shoulder pain undergoing shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA), or a shoulder ultrasound who are known to have had shoulder radiographs performed within the preceding 3 months based on information from the radiology information system (RIS), patient-provided radiological history, or other health-care source.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Shoulder pain is common, affecting approximately 6.7% of the U.S. population (Cunningham &amp; Kelsey, 1984). Radiographs are indicated as part of the initial work-up for shoulder pain. Advanced imaging studies should only be utilized when the diagnosis remains unclear. In recent years, there has been growing concern regarding the overuse of imaging services (American College of Radiology [ACR], 2012). One report estimates that 20% to 50% of diagnostic imaging studies fail to provide information that improves the diagnosis or treatment of the patient (America's Health Insurance Plans [AHIP], 2008). </p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and other references</strong>: </p>
<p>Acute (less than 2 weeks) shoulder pain can be attributable to structures related to the glenohumeral articulation and joint capsule, the rotator cuff, acromioclavicular joint, and scapula. Radiography is a safe, fast, low-cost imaging modality that effectively demonstrates many forms of shoulder pathology. However, a multimodal approach may be required to accurately assess shoulder pathology. Radiography is a useful initial screening modality for acute shoulder pain of all causes. Radiography is useful in the evaluation of fractures of the shoulder girdle (Wise et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Radiographs are indicated as part of the initial work-up for all chronic shoulder pain (Burbank et al., 2008).</p>
<p>Further testing of chronic shoulder pain should be utilized when the diagnosis remains unclear or the outcome would change management. Imaging options include MRI, arthrography, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography (Burbank et al., 2008).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
As imaging technology continues to advance, the United States healthcare system has seen an increase in both the type and frequency of imaging studies being performed. The increase in utilization of imaging studies is accompanied by a corresponding increase in cost and exposure to radiation for both patients and healthcare professionals. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the number of radiologic procedures performed in the United States showed a ten-fold increase while the annual per-capita effective dose from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures increased by 600% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, the number of computerized tomographic (CT) examinations tripled, while the number of ultrasounds nearly doubled (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine, and ultrasound) accounted for approximately 35% of all imaging studies (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the proportion of radiation exposure that is attributable to medical sources increased from 17% to 53% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, while CT scans only accounted for approximately 17% of all radiologic procedures performed in the United States, they accounted for over 65% of the total effective radiation dose from radiologic procedures (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, the estimated per-capita effective radiation dose for radiologic procedures in the United States was nearly 20% higher than the average for other well-developed countries (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic imaging was prioritized as a topic area for measure development due to a high level of utilization, rising costs, and the need for measures to help promote appropriate use of imaging and improve outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
From 1996 to 2005, the use of musculoskeletal MRIs increased by 353.5% among Medicare recipients, while the use of musculoskeletal CT scans increased by 326.5%. In comparison, the use of musculoskeletal x-rays only increased 19.1% (Parker et al., 2008). A recent study by George et al. (2014) found that approximately 35% of all shoulder MRIs were performed without recent prior radiographs.</p></div>
