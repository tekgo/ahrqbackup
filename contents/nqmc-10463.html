Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older receiving a surveillance colonoscopy, with a history of a prior adenomatous polyp(s) in previous colonoscopy findings, who had an interval of 3 or more years since their last colonoscopy.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Colonoscopy is the recommended method of surveillance after the removal of adenomatous polyps because it has been shown to significantly reduce subsequent colorectal cancer incidence. The time interval for the development of malignant changes in adenomatous polyps is estimated at 5 to 25 years (Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [ICSI], 2006). Inappropriate interval recommendations can result in overuse of resources and can lead to significant patient harm. Performing colonoscopy too often not only increases patients' exposure to procedural harm, but also drains resources that could be more effectively used to adequately screen those in need (Lieberman et al., 2009).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>: </p>
<p>Patients with only 1 or 2 small (less than 1 cm) tubular adenomas with only low-grade dysplasia should have their next follow-up colonoscopy in 5 to 10 years; the precise timing within this interval should be based on other clinical factors (such as prior colonoscopy findings, family history, and the preferences of the patient and judgment of the physician). Patients with 3 to 10 adenomas, or any adenoma greater than or equal to 1 cm, or any adenoma with villous features, or high-grade dysplasia should have their next follow-up colonoscopy in 3 years providing that piecemeal removal has not been performed and the adenoma(s) is removed completely; if the follow-up colonoscopy is normal or shows only 1 or 2 small tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia, then the interval for the subsequent examination should be 5 years (Winawer et al., 2006).</p>
<p>Patients with greater than 10 adenomas are thought to be at particularly high risk, and current multi-society guidelines therefore recommend early surveillance colonoscopy in these individuals (less than 3 years) (Lieberman et al., 2012). However, it is important to note that risk is a continuum; an individual with 11 adenomas is not at dramatically higher risk than an individual with 9 or 10 adenomas. Thus, the optimal threshold at which early surveillance colonoscopy becomes worthwhile is subject to debate. For instance, in the United Kingdom, early surveillance colonoscopy is recommended for individuals with even fewer adenomas (greater than or equal to 5 adenomas of any size, or greater than or equal to 3 adenomas with at least one large adenoma). A lower threshold is likely to result in higher colonoscopy utilization, but it may also provide greater clinical benefit (Mart&iacute;nez et al., 2012). </p></div>
