Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adults 18 to 64 years of age with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis who were not dispensed an antibiotic prescription on or three days after the Index Episode Start Date (IESD).</p>
<p>This measure assesses whether antibiotics were inappropriately prescribed for healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age with bronchitis and builds on an existing HEDIS measure that targets inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for children with upper respiratory infection (URI). See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measure <a href="/content.aspx?id=49746" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Appropriate treatment for children with upper respiratory infection (URI): percentage of children 3 months to 18 years of age who were given a diagnosis of URI and were not dispensed an antibiotic prescription</a>.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This measure is reported as an inverted rate (1 - [numerator/eligible population]). A higher rate indicates appropriate treatment of adults with acute bronchitis (i.e., proportion for whom antibiotics were <em>not</em> prescribed).</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Antibiotics are most often inappropriately prescribed for adults with acute bronchitis (Gonzales et al., "Excessive antibiotic use," 2001). Antibiotics are not indicated in clinical guidelines for treating adults with acute bronchitis who do not have a comorbidity or other infection for which antibiotics may be appropriate (Gonzales et al., "Acute respiratory tract infections," 2001; Gonzales et al., "Nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections," 2001). Inappropriate antibiotic treatment of adults with acute bronchitis is of clinical concern, especially since misuse and overuse of antibiotics lead to antibiotic drug resistance (Steinman et al., 2004). Acute bronchitis consistently ranks among the 10 conditions that account for the most ambulatory office visits to United States (U.S.) physicians; furthermore, while the vast majority of acute bronchitis cases (more than 90 percent) have a nonbacterial cause, antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed 65 to 80 percent of the time (Gonzales et al., "Excessive antibiotic use," 2001; McCaig, Besser, &amp; Hughes, 2003).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Antibiotics cost the health care system billions of dollars each year, and treating conditions such as acute bronchitis adds to the cost. Current guidelines recommend against antibiotic treatment for acute bronchitis in adults who are otherwise healthy (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], "Antibiotic resistance," 2013; CDC, "Acute cough illness," 2013) because overuse can lead to antibiotic resistance (CDC, "Bronchitis," 2013). </li>
    <li>The United States spends approximately $55 billion in health service costs and lost productivity due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Smith &amp; Coast, 2013). </li>
    <li>More than 60 to 90 percent of patients with acute bronchitis who seek care are given antibiotics (Evertsen et al., 2010; Kroening-Roche et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Most healthy people who get acute bronchitis get better without antibiotics; complications usually occur in older adults and children, and in people with other health issues ("Acute bronchitis," 2012). </li>
    <li>Acute bronchitis almost always gets better on its own; therefore, adults who do not have other health problems should not take antibiotics. Ensuring the appropriate use of antibiotics for patients with acute bronchitis will help them avoid harmful side-effects and possible resistance to antibiotics over time. </li>
</ul>
