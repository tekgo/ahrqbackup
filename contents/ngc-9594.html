Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the quality of evidence (High, Moderate, Low, Very low) and strength of recommendations (Strong and Conditional) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of Gastroparesis Syndrome and Gastroparesis Symptoms</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The diagnosis of gastroparesis is based on the combination of symptoms of gastroparesis, absence of gastric outlet obstruction or ulceration, and delay in gastric emptying. (<strong>Strong recommendation, high level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Accelerated gastric emptying and functional dyspepsia can present with symptoms similar to those of gastroparesis; therefore, documentation of delayed gastric emptying is recommended before selecting therapy with prokinetics agents or gastric electrical stimulation (GES). (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Identifying the Cause of Gastroparesis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with gastroparesis should be screened for the presence of diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, neurological disease, prior gastric or bariatric surgery, and autoimmune disorders. Patients should undergo biochemical screen for diabetes and hypothyroidism; other tests are as indicated clinically. (<strong>Strong recommendation, high level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>A prodrome suggesting a viral illness may lead to gastroparesis (postviral gastroparesis). This condition may improve over time in some patients. Clinicians should inquire about the presence of a prior acute illness suggestive of a viral infection. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Markedly uncontrolled (&gt;200 mg/dl) glucose levels may aggravate symptoms of gastroparesis and delay gastric emptying. (<strong>Strong recommendation, high level of evidence</strong>) Optimization of glycemic control should be a target for therapy; this may improve symptoms and the delayed gastric emptying. (<strong>Moderate recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Medication-induced delay in gastric emptying, particularly from narcotic and anticholinergic agents and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and amylin analogs among diabetics, should be considered in patients before assigning an etiological diagnosis. Narcotics and other medications that can delay gastric emptying should be stopped to establish the diagnosis with a gastric emptying test. (<strong>Strong recommendation, high level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Gastroparesis can be associated with and may aggravate gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Evaluation for the presence of gastroparesis should be considered in patients with GERD that is refractory to acid-suppressive treatment. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Gastroparesis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Documented delay in gastric emptying is required for the diagnosis of gastroparesis. Scintigraphic gastric emptying of solids is the standard for the evaluation of gastric emptying and the diagnosis of gastroparesis. The most reliable method and parameter for diagnosis of gastroparesis is gastric retention of solids at 4 hours (h)&nbsp;measured by scintigraphy. Studies of shorter duration or based on a liquid challenge result in decreased sensitivity in the diagnosis of gastroparesis. (<strong>Strong recommendation, high level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Alternative approaches for assessment of gastric emptying include wireless capsule motility testing and <sup>13</sup>C breath testing using octanoate or spirulina incorporated into a solid meal; they require further validation before they can be considered as alternates to scintigraphy for the diagnosis of gastroparesis. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Medications that affect gastric emptying should be stopped at least 48 h before diagnostic testing; depending on the pharmacokinetics of the medication, the drug may need to be stopped &gt;48 h before testing. (<strong>Strong recommendation, high level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Patients with diabetes should have blood glucose measured before starting the gastric emptying test, and hyperglycemia treated with test started after blood glucose is &lt;275 mg/dl. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate-high level of evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria and Differential Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The presence of rumination syndrome and/or eating disorders (including anorexia nervosa and bulimia) should be considered when evaluating a patient for gastroparesis. These disorders may be associated with delayed gastric emptying, and identification of these disorders may alter management. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate-high level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) defined as recurrent episodic episodes of nausea and vomiting, should also be considered during the patient history. These patients may require alternative therapy. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Chronic usage of cannabinoid agents may cause a syndrome similar to CVS. Patients presenting with symptoms of gastroparesis should be advised to stop using these agents. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Management of Gastroparesis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The first line of management for gastroparesis patients should include restoration of fluids and electrolytes, nutritional support and in diabetics, optimization of glycemic control. (<strong>Strong&nbsp;recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Oral intake is preferable for nutrition and hydration. Patients should receive counseling from a dietician regarding consumption of frequent small volume nutrient meals that are low in fat and soluble fiber. If unable to tolerate solid food, then use of homogenized or liquid nutrient meals is recommended. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Oral intake is the preferable route for nutrition and hydration. If oral intake is insufficient, then enteral alimentation by jejunostomy tube feeding should be pursued (after a trial of nasoenteric tube feeding). Indications for enteral nutrition include unintentional loss of 10% or more of the usual body weight during a period of 3&ndash;6 months, and/or repeated hospitalizations for refractory symptoms. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>For enteral alimentation, postpyloric feeding is preferable to gastric feeding because gastric delivery can be associated with erratic nutritional support. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Enteral feeding is preferable to parenteral nutrition. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Glycemic Control in Diabetic Gastroparesis (DG)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Good glycemic control should be the goal. Since acute hyperglycemia inhibits gastric emptying, it is assumed that improved glycemic control may improve gastric emptying and reduce symptoms. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Pramlintide and GLP-1 analogs may delay gastric emptying in diabetics. Cessation of these treatments and use of alternative approaches should be considered before initiation of therapy for gastroparesis. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pharmacologic Therapy</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In addition to dietary therapy, prokinetic therapy should be considered to improve gastric emptying and gastroparesis symptoms, taking into account benefits and risks of treatment. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Metoclopramide is the first line of prokinetic therapy and should be administered at the lowest effective dose in a liquid formation to facilitate absorption. The risk of tardive dyskinesia has been estimated to be &lt;1%. Patients should be instructed to discontinue therapy if they develop side effects including involuntary movements. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>For patients unable to use metoclopramide, domperidone can be prescribed with investigational new drug clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been shown to be as effective as metoclopramide in reducing symptoms without the propensity for causing central nervous system side effects; given the propensity of domperidone to prolong corrected QT interval on electrocardiogram, a baseline electrocardiogram is recommended and treatment withheld if the corrected QT is &gt;470 ms in male and 450 ms in female patients. Follow-up electrocardiogram on treatment with domperidone is also advised. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Erythromycin improves gastric emptying and symptoms from delayed gastric emptying. Administration of intravenous (IV) erythromycin should be considered when IV prokinetic therapy is needed in hospitalized patients. Oral treatment with erythromycin improves gastric emptying also. However, the long-term effectiveness of oral therapy is limited by tachyphylaxis. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Treatment with antiemetic agents should occur for improvement of associated nausea and vomiting but will not result in improved gastric emptying. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) can be considered for refractory nausea and vomiting in gastroparesis but will not result in improved gastric emptying and may potentially retard gastric emptying. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Intrapyloric Botulinum Toxin Injection</strong></p>
<p>Intrapyloric injection of botulinum toxin is not recommended for patients with gastroparesis based on randomized controlled trials. (<strong>Strong recommendation, high level of evidence</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Gastric Electrical Stimulation (GES)</strong></p>
<p>GES may be considered for compassionate treatment in patients with refractory symptoms, particularly nausea and vomiting. Symptom severity and gastric emptying have been shown to improve in patients with diabetic gastroparesis (DG), but not in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis (IG) or postsurgical gastroparesis (PSG). (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Surgical Treatments: Venting Gastrostomy, Gastrojejunostomy, Pyloroplasty, and Gastrectomy</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Gastrostomy for venting and/or jejunostomy for feeding may be performed for symptom relief. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Completion gastrectomy could be considered in patients with PSG who remain markedly symptomatic and fail medical therapy. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>Surgical pyloroplasty or gastrojejunosotomy has been performed for treatment for refractory gastroparesis. However, further studies are needed before advocating this treatment. Partial gastrectomy and pyloroplasty should be used rarely, only in carefully selected patients. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Complementary and Alternative Therapies</strong></p>
<p>Acupuncture can be considered as an alternative therapy. This has been associated with improved rates of gastric emptying and reduction of symptoms. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence</strong>)</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The FDA placed a black-box warning on metoclopramide because of the risk of side effects, including tardive dyskinesia. </li>
    <li>Complications of enteral nutrition include infection, tube migration, and dislodgement. </li>
    <li>With enteral nutrition, there is a theoretical risk of increased pulmonary aspiration in patients with weak lower esophageal sphincter; hence, it is advisable that the feeding tube should be placed well beyond the angle of Treitz in such patients. </li>
    <li>Complications from gastric electrical stimulation (GES) such as local infection or lead migration, as well as complications related to the surgery may occur in up to 10% of patients implanted. </li>
    <li>The risk of malnutrition and weight loss following gastrectomy has to be weighed relative to the symptom relief. </li>
    <li>Metoclopramide is the first line of prokinetic therapy and should be administered at the lowest effective dose. The risk of tardive dyskinesia has been estimated to be &lt; 1%. Patients should be instructed to discontinue therapy if they develop side effects including involuntary movements. </li>
    <li>Several US medical centers have recently placed several additional restrictions on promethazine, related to concerns about sedation, possible cardiac toxicity (corrected QT prolongation), damage to peripheral veins, and lack of availability of the drug. </li>
    <li>The synthetic cannabinoid, dronabinol, carries the risk of hyperemesis on withdrawal, and optimum treatment strategies are unclear. </li>
