<h2>Recommendations

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Recommendation 1: Counseling about Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and the <em>cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)</em>-related Disease Spectrum</strong></p>
<p>While most positive CF carrier screening results identify mutations associated with classic CF disease, genetic counselors offering CF carrier screening should ensure that they are providing the most current information to patients regarding the range of symptoms, potential treatment options, and quality of life issues associated with CF and the <em>CFTR</em>-related disease spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2: To Whom Should Carrier Testing for CF Be Offered?</strong></p>
<p>Carrier testing for CF should be offered to all women of reproductive age, regardless of ancestry; preferably preconceptionally. CF carrier testing should also be offered to any individual with a family history of CF and to partners of mutation carriers and people with CF.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3: Pre-test Risk Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Pre-test risk assessment should include an estimate of CF carrier frequency based on the individual's family history, ethnic background, and the predicted residual risk to have a child with CF if the test is negative.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4: CF Carrier Test Selection</strong></p>
<p>Carrier testing panels should include the mutations recommended by the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). For individuals of non-Northern European descent, pan-ethnic panels that include additional mutations more commonly identified in minority populations are appropriate to consider. Focus general population CF screening practices on identifying carriers of established disease-causing <em>CFTR</em> mutations.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5: Changes in Testing Panels and Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion of mutations on available <em>CFTR</em> mutation screening panels remains a dynamic process as new information is learned about the pathogenicity of <em>CFTR</em> mutations. When individuals present for genetic counseling with prior carrier screening results, those results should be reviewed and re-interpreted, if necessary, in light of current knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6: Communicating Negative and +/&minus; Carrier Screening Results</strong></p>
<p>Clients who have had a negative CF carrier screening test result should be informed of their reduced or residual risk to have a child with cystic fibrosis, and the possibility of their child having an abnormal CF newborn screen if one partner is a CF carrier.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 7: Counseling Couples at Risk to Have a Child with CF</strong></p>
<p>When both parents are known carriers for CF, available prenatal and pre-implantation diagnostic testing should be offered. Prenatal facilitation of a monitoring plan should begin for couples at risk or who continue a pregnancy known to have CF, and postnatal evaluation through sweat testing and state newborn screening (NBS) programs, should be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 8: The R117H/Poly T and 5T/Thymidine/Guanine (TG) Tract Alleles</strong></p>
<p>If a client is found to carry an R117H mutation, it is important to ensure the testing laboratory performs reflex testing for poly T status along with studies to determine the <em>cis/trans</em> orientation of the poly T alleles. In the absence of an R117H mutation, assessment of the intron 8 poly T or TG tracts is not recommended for routine CF carrier testing.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 9: Individuals with &ge;2 Mutations Identified by Carrier Screening</strong></p>
<p>Identification of two or more mutations in a patient referred for routine carrier screening should lead to a referral for clinical diagnostic evaluation. If the mutations identified are uncommon <em>CFTR</em> sequence variants, the likelihood of pathogenicity may be refined through determination of phase (<em>cis/trans</em> orientation).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 10: CF Genotype/Phenotype Correlations</strong></p>
<p>While some broad correlations can be made between genotype and anticipated phenotype, genetic counselors should not counsel regarding severity of disease course based on published case reports or individual patient experience.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In cases where one member of a couple has been identified as a cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier and the second has had negative carrier test results, the counseling issues may become more challenging. Framing the residual risk in alternative formats may be helpful. Some patients may have negative emotional, cognitive, and/or behavioral responses to information they find to be ambiguous, and it can be helpful to explore feelings and perceptions about what it would be like to have a child with CF. It is also important to explore whether there are moral, religious, or cultural factors playing a role in the response. </li>
    <li>Informing patients about the role CF newborn screening in identifying CF patients with rare mutations and preparing patients for the potential to have a (likely false) positive CF newborn screen if their newborn carries one mutation may help to alleviate post-partum concerns. </li>
</ul>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The practice guidelines of the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) are developed by members of the NSGC to assist genetic counselors and other health care providers in making decisions about appropriate management of genetic concerns, including access to and/or delivery of services. Each practice guideline focuses on a clinical or practice-based issue, and is the result of a review and analysis of current professional literature believed to be reliable. As such, information and recommendations within the NSGC practice guidelines reflect the current scientific and clinical knowledge at the time of publication, are only current as of their publication date, and are subject to change without notice as advances emerge. </li>
    <li>In addition, variations in practice, which take into account the needs of the individual patient and the resources and limitations unique to the institution or type of practice, may warrant approaches, treatments and/or procedures that differ from the recommendations outlined in this guideline. Therefore, these recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. Genetic counseling practice guidelines are never intended to displace a health care provider's best medical judgment based on the clinical circumstances of a particular patient or patient population. </li>
    <li>Practice guidelines are published by NSGC for educational and informational purposes only, and NSGC does not "approve" or "endorse" any specific methods, practices, or sources of information. </li>
