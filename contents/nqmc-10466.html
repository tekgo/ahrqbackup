<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encounter who were prescribed prednisone equivalents greater than or equal to 10 mg/day for 60 or greater consecutive days or a single prescription equating to 600 mg prednisone or greater for all fills and were documented for risk of bone loss once during the reporting year or the previous calendar year.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often rely on their gastroenterologist for healthcare maintenance. In addition, the gastroenterologist also provides guidance to the patient's primary care physician on a broad range of issues such as vaccinations, osteoporosis screening, and cancer/dysplasia surveillance. Screening for osteoporosis is based on a combination of individual risk factors, but a history of prolonged (greater than 3 months) steroid use over 10 mg is reason enough to obtain dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanning (Moscandrew, Mahadevan, &amp; Kane, 2009). </p>
<p>Markers of greater osteoporosis and fracture risk include older age, hypogonadism, corticosteroid therapy, and established cirrhosis (American Gastroenterological Association [AGA], "Osteoporosis in hepatic disorders," 2003). </p>
<p>The decision to measure bone density should follow an individualized approach. It should be considered when it will help the patient decide whether to institute treatment to prevent osteoporotic fracture. It should also be considered in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for two months or more and patients with other conditions that place them at high risk for osteoporotic fracture ("Osteoporosis prevention," 2000). </p>
<p>The most commonly used measurement to diagnose osteoporosis and predict fracture risk is based on assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) ("Osteoporosis prevention," 2000). </p>
<p>Measurements of BMD made at the hip predict hip fracture better than measurements made at other sites while BMD measurement at the spine predicts spine fracture better than measures at other sites ("Osteoporosis prevention," 2000). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>: </p>
<p>IBD has only a modest effect on BMD, with a pooled Z score of -0.5 (AGA, "Guidelines on osteoporosis," 2003). </p>
<p>Corticosteroid use is the variable most strongly associated with osteoporosis. However, it is difficult to distinguish corticosteroid use from disease activity in terms of causal impact on bone density, because the two are closely linked (AGA, "Guidelines on osteoporosis," 2003). </p>
<p>However there is strong evidence that those on long-term steroids of greater than three months have a significant increase risk of fracture (Papaioannou, Ferko, &amp; Adachi, 2001). DXA screening is recommended in inflammatory bowel disease patients with one or more risk factors: history of vertebral fractures, postmenopausal, male greater than 50 years of age, chronic corticosteroid therapy, or hypogonadism. If the initial DXA is normal, the AGA recommends repeat testing in 2 to 3 years. If the patient has osteoporosis, or has a history of a low trauma fracture, evaluation for secondary causes should be completed. Suggested studies include a complete blood count, serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase level, calcium, creatinine, and 25-OH vitamin D, serum protein electrophoresis, serum calcium, and a testosterone level in males (Bernstein, Leslie, &amp; Leboff, 2003).</p>
<p>Data on the treatment of osteoporosis in Crohn's disease depend on studies that are not specific to IBD. The evidence levels and recommendation grades are accordingly marked down. Weight bearing, isotonic exercise, stopping smoking, avoiding alcohol excess, and maintaining adequate dietary calcium (greater than 1 g/day) are beneficial. Hormone replacement treatment is no longer generally advised in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, but regular use of bisphosphonates, calcitonin and its derivatives, and raloxifene may reduce or prevent further bone loss. Data in men with osteoporosis are less secure but bisphosphonates are probably of value. Newer data also support the use of strontium salts. Patients receiving systemic steroid therapy should receive calcium and vitamin D for prophylaxis (Van Assche et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Diagnosis of osteoporosis in adults is best made from a T score of less than -2.5 on radiographic bone densitometry, all other diagnosis methods having current limitations. The presence of osteoporosis identifies patients at above average risk for fracture and who should receive treatment. Osteopenia may be a prognostic marker for future osteoporosis, but presents little direct risk. However if the T score is less than -1.5, treatment with calcium and vitamin D should be recommended. Pre-existing history of fracture is of substantial adverse prognostic significance and patients should be treated for osteoporosis even if the T score is normal (Van Assche et al., 2013). </p></div>
