Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the levels of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low, Very low</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong for, Weak for, No recommendation, Strong against</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p><em>Offer</em> patients with suspected contact dermatitis a patch test with a baseline series of allergens. (<strong>Strong recommendation <em>for</em> the use of an intervention</strong>)</p>
<p>In identifying allergens in patients with contact dermatitis, <em>consider</em> testing for additional series dependent on allergen exposure. (<strong>Weak recommendation <em>for</em> the use of the intervention</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Consider</em> additional readings at day 6 or 7 if the results are unexpectedly negative at day 4. (<strong>Weak recommendation <em>for</em> the use of the intervention</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Prevention</strong></p>
<p><em>Consider</em> skin care and skin protection creams in preventing occupational dermatitis. (<strong>Weak recommendation <em>for</em> the use of the intervention</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p><em>Offer</em> alitretinoin to patients with severe chronic hand eczema.* (<strong>Strong recommendation <em>for</em> the use of the intervention</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Consider</em> topical tacrolimus to patients with contact dermatitis where topical steroids are unsuitable or ineffective. (<strong>Weak recommendation <em>for</em> the use of the intervention</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Consider</em> psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy for treating patients with chronic hand eczema. (<strong>Weak recommendation <em>for</em> the use of the intervention</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Consider</em> patient education in occupational contact dermatitis. (<strong>Weak recommendation <em>for</em> the use of the intervention</strong>)</p>
<p class="Note">*Note: See National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Alitretinoin for the treatment of severe chronic hand eczema. Available at: <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta177" title="NICE Web site">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta177</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Good-Practice Recommendations (Informal Consensus)</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Use</em> clinical assessment tools such as the Dermatology Life Quality Index and the Hand Eczema Severity Index for both the initial assessment and the response to treatment of patients with contact dermatitis.</p>
<p><em>Take</em> a detailed history, including symptoms and if they were related to application or use of any particular product, a specific activity or occupation.</p>
<p>If related to the workplace <em>investigate</em> the work practice and products handled at work, supplemented by examination of health and safety data sheets.</p>
<p><em>Provide</em> a patient information leaflet on patch testing as part of the counselling process, which includes information on potential side-effects. Informed patient consent should be obtained.</p>
<p><em>Offer</em> patch testing for patients with chronic or persistent dermatitis as clinical features alone are unreliable in distinguishing allergic contact from irritant and endogenous dermatitis, particularly with hand and facial dermatitis.</p>
<p><em>Consider</em> deferring patch testing for 3 months after finishing systemic agents and 6 months after finishing biological agents to minimize the chance of false-negative reactions, if possible.</p>

<p>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) consisted of consultant dermatologists, a nurse specialist and patient representatives.</p>
<p>The GDG established several clinical questions pertinent to the scope of the guideline and a set of outcome measures of importance to patients, ranked according to the GRADE methodology. The clinical questions in patients with contact dermatitis pertinent to the scope of the guidelines included the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Which and how many allergens should be used in tests? </li>
        <li>When should tests be carried out? </li>
        <li>Does increasing the number of allergens tested improve diagnosis? </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Prevention
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical and Economic Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The management of contact dermatitis includes diagnosis, treatment and prevention. There are few studies that look at economic considerations.</p>
<p><strong>What Is the Economic Burden of Suffering from Contact Dermatitis?</strong></p>
<p>The annual societal cost of patients suffering from occupational contact dermatitis is high and comparable with patients with severe atopic/endogenous dermatitis or psoriasis. The costs of suffering from contact dermatitis have been reported as amounting to approximately &euro;2300 for occupational contact dermatitis and &euro;1000 for non-occupational contact dermatitis per patient per annum. As contact dermatitis is so common, this represents a substantial economic burden.</p>
<p><strong>Is It Worthwhile Managing Patients with Contact Dermatitis in a Multidisciplinary Clinic?</strong></p>
<p>Integrated care programmes with a multidisciplinary team, including a dermatologist specializing in patch testing, a specialized nurse and an occupational physician, have been proposed for patients with moderate-to-severe hand dermatitis felt to be work related, and the majority of whom would have at least an element of contact dermatitis. These have been found to be effective in improving outcomes in the short term compared with standard care (patch testing and management by a dermatologist). However, this difference disappears after 12 months. Integrated care programmes cost substantially more than standard care (&euro;3613 vs. &euro;1576 per patient).</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Studies in occupational settings have demonstrated improvements in established hand dermatitis after comprehensive intervention education programmes. The prevention of hand dermatitis with similar programmes has also been reported. </li>
    <li>Because some allergens often do not yield positive reactions until after day 4, a third reading at day 7 will pick up approximately 10% more positive reactions that were negative on days 2 and 4. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is some evidence that prolonged glove use impairs stratum corneum barrier function. </li>
    <li>Some allergens are more likely to cause irritant reactions than others. These reactions may be difficult to interpret and are misclassified easily as positive reactions. </li>
    <li>Adverse events associated with patch testing are rare. Patients should be counselled that a positive result will produce skin reddening, itching and occasionally blistering at the application site, but that this usually disappears after a few days. Patients should be warned that some positive test reactions, for example to gold, may persist for up to 1 month; that a positive patch test may be accompanied by a ﬂare of existing or previous eczema at distant sites; that an increase or decrease in pigment may be seen at the site of patch tests; and of the small possibility of infection or scarring at the treatment site. Active sensitization is also rare. </li>
    <li>The skin to be tested should be free from dermatitis, and skin disease elsewhere, as well controlled as possible. This will help avoid the 'angry back syndrome' with numerous false-positive results. </li>
    <li>False-positive and false-negative results often occur when patch testing to products brought by the patient and should be interpreted with care. </li>
    <li>If a patient applies potent topical steroids to the back up to 2 days prior to the test being applied, or is taking oral corticosteroids, there is a significant risk of false-negative results and decreased reactivity. </li>
    <li>Patch testing should be deferred for 6 weeks after natural and artiﬁcial ultraviolet (UV) exposure, 3 months after ﬁnishing systemic agents and 6 months after ﬁnishing biological agents, to minimize the chance of false-negative reactions. </li>
    <li>While there is no evidence that patch testing in pregnancy is harmful, no safety data are available. Therefore, patch testing should be undertaken only when required and after informed consent is obtained. </li>
</ul>
