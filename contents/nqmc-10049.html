<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There are numerous case reports in the literature regarding patient burns in the surgical and procedural setting. The diversity of the causative agents underscores the multitude of potential risks that must be properly mitigated to avoid patient burns. </p>
<p>The literature on burns suggests that electrosurgical burns are most common. A recent publication from ECRI Institute highlights the increased risk of burns with newer surgical devices that apply higher currents at longer activation times. Although electrical burns are most prevalent, other mechanisms of burn injury are frequently reported in case studies and case series. These include chemical and thermal burns. </p>
<p>Surgical fires are rare; however, their consequences can be grave, killing or seriously injuring patients and surgical staff. The risk of surgical fire is present whenever and wherever surgery is performed, whether in an operating room, a physician's office, or an outpatient clinic. </p>
<p>Recognizing the diversity of mechanisms by which a patient could sustain an unintentional burn in the Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) setting, the definition of burn is broad, encompassing all six recognized means by which a burn can occur - scalds, contact, fire, chemical, electrical, or radiation. This will allow stakeholders to develop a better understanding of the incidence of these events and further refine means to ensure prevention.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Practice Guidelines </strong><br />
The risk of burns related to laser use can be reduced by adherence to the guidelines published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 2005) for safe use of these devices in the health care setting. Similarly, the risk of burns related to the use of electrosurgical devices can be reduced by following the electrosurgery checklist published by ECRI. The risk of surgical fires can be reduced by minimizing ignition, oxidizer, and fuel risks (the "classic triangle"). The American Society of Anesthesiologists Practice Advisory for the Prevention and Management of Operating Room Fires (2008) seeks to prevent the occurrence of operating room (OR) fires, reduce adverse outcomes associated with OR fires and identify the elements of a fire response protocol.</p>
<p>Guidance for the prevention of surgical fire has also been published by the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (2006), formerly Association of Operating Room Nurses (AORN).</p></div>
