<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Roughly 7% of adults and children in Minnesota are currently living with asthma. Asthma is a chronic disease associated with familial, infectious, allergenic, socioeconomic, psychosocial and environmental factors. It is not curable but is treatable. Despite improvements in diagnosis and management, and an increased understanding of the epidemiology, immunology, and biology of the disease, asthma prevalence has progressively increased over the past 15 years. It is up to providers to assess patients, prescribe medications, educate about self-management, help patients identify and mitigate triggers so patients can prevent their exacerbations.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Prevalence with Adults</strong>: The <em>Asthma in Minnesota 2008 Epidemiology Report</em> published by the Minnesota Department of Health noted that in 2007:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>10.9% of adults in Minnesota reported that they had been told sometime in their lifetime that they had asthma; 7.7% reported that they still had asthma. </li>
        <li>That translates to an estimated 429,000 Minnesota adults who have a history of asthma and an estimated 303,000 who currently have asthma (Minnesota Department of Health, n.d.). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prevalence with Children</strong>: In 2006, the Minnesota Behavioral Risk Surveillance System (BRFSS) reported that:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>9.5% of children (age 0 to 17) in Minnesota have been diagnosed with asthma, and 7% were reported to currently have asthma. </li>
        <li>That translates to an estimated 116,000 Minnesota children with a history of asthma and an estimated 85,000 who currently have asthma. The prevalence of asthma among children has remained stable since 2003 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], n.d.). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prevalence Nationally</strong>: An estimated 22.2 million adults and 6.5 million children currently have asthma in the United States. </li>
    <li><strong>Minnesota Costs</strong>: The total costs for asthma in Minnesota for 2003 were estimated at $363.9 million, including $208.6 million in direct costs of office visits, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and medication, and $155.3 million in indirect costs of missed school and work days (Coffey et al., 2006). </li>
    <li><strong>National Costs</strong>: In 2004, the economic costs of asthma for the United States were estimated at more than $16 billion. This figure included $4.6 billion in lost productivity. Updated estimates for direct medical expenditures alone in 2007 were $37.2 billion (Kamble &amp; Bharmal, 2009). The societal costs of asthma are acutely felt in the pediatric population with asthma cited as the most frequent cause of pediatric emergency room use and hospital admissions as well as the leading cause of school absences. </li>
</ul>

Extent of Measure Testing

<div class="content_para"><p>MN Community Measurement (MNCM) conducts validity testing to determine if quality measures truly measure what they are designed to measure, and conducts reliability testing to determine if measures yield stable, consistent results. Validity testing is done to see if the concept behind the measure reflects the quality of care that is provided to a patient and if the measure, as specified, accurately assesses the intended quality concept.
