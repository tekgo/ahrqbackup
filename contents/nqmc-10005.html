<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of enrolled members age 19 years and older who are up-to-date for all appropriate preventive services (combination 6) based on age and gender.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Appropriate and timely preventive care significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. Preventive service rates improve if every patient encounter is seen as an opportunity to address preventive care needs. Looking at the member's up-to-date status as inclusive of all required preventive services, rather than individual, discrete services is more meaningful and patient centered.</p></div>
