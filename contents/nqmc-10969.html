<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>It is important for surgeons to be able to compare their surgical outcomes to those of peer institutions as a means of assessing results and improving quality of care. Prolonged length of stay after pulmonary lobectomy is both a surrogate marker of morbidity, but also, importantly, a direct marker of increased resource utilization. Knowing their rate of risk‐adjusted prolonged length of stay gives lower performing thoracic programs the opportunity to design quality improvement initiatives. These should lead to better patient outcomes and decreased resource utilization.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Lobectomy is considered the gold standard for patients with stage I lung cancer and is the most common operation performed for early stage lung cancer within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database (Ginsburg &amp; Rubinstein, 1995; Boffa et al., 2008). Approximately 50,000 lobectomies are performed in the United States each year. Prolonged length of stay after lobectomy has been demonstrated to be a surrogate marker for complications after lobectomy (Wright et al., 2008). Patients within the STS General Thoracic Surgery Database (GTSD) with a prolonged length of stay greater than 14 days have a markedly increased mortality rate, 10.8% vs. 0.7% (p less than 0.0001). Patients with lengths of stay longer than 16 days have increased 30-day readmission rates as well (Freeman et al., 2013). Both of these intuitively demonstrate the increase in resource utilization from prolonged length of stay. Variability exists in length of stay following even uncomplicated lobectomy and can be driven by factors such as age, gender, payer, comorbidities, and surgical approach (Giambrone et al., 2016). Reducing postoperative complications and length of stay requires good patient selection and may be enhanced by cardiopulmonary exercise testing in selected patients with marginal pulmonary function (Brunelli et al., 2012). Surgeon factors, such as surgical approach chosen for lobectomy, are a strong predictor of postoperative complications and length of stay. A propensity matched analysis within the STS GTSD demonstrated that thoracoscopic lobectomy reduced both complications as well as length of stay when compared with open lobectomy (Paul et al., 2010). Similarly, an analysis of the National Inpatient Sample demonstrated fewer in‐hospital complications and shorter length of stay with a thoracoscopic approach and also demonstrated that only 15% of lobectomies were being done thoracoscopically (Paul et al., 2013). In-hospital, post‐surgical pathways can also alter prolonged length of stay. Implementation of a multimodal enhanced recovery pathway has been associated with a decrease in length of stay and complications with no increase in readmissions (Madani et al., 2015).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>General Thoracic Surgery Database (GTSD) participating sites are randomly selected for participation in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) GTSD Audit, which is designed to evaluate the accuracy, consistency, and comprehensiveness of data collection and ultimately validate the integrity of the data contained in the database. Telligen, formerly the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care, has conducted audits on behalf of STS since 2006. In 2015, ten percent of randomly selected STS GTSD participants (N = 25, an increase from 24 in 2014 and 18 in 2013) were audited. The audit process involves re‐abstraction of data for 20 cases records (at least 15 lobectomy and up to 5 esophagectomy) and comparison of 40 STS GTSD V2.2 individual data elements with those submitted to the data warehouse. Agreement rates are calculated for each variable, each variable category and overall. In 2015, the overall aggregate agreement rate was 97.02%, demonstrating that the data contained in the STS GTSD are both comprehensive and highly accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis</strong> </p>
<p>Aggregate agreement rates were computed for all facilities by calculation of the sum of all facilities' numerators divided by the sum of all facilities' denominators, for each individual variable, each variable category and overall. </p>
<p>Chi-square statistics were calculated to identify any possible relationships between the data collection process variables and agreement rates. Tests where the chi-square statistic had a probability of less than 5% (p less than 0.05) were considered to show statistically significant differences in agreement rate between the levels of the process measure. </p>
<p><strong>Agreement Rate Results </strong></p>
<p>Database validity was evaluated by re-abstraction of defined variables from the medical records and comparison to submitted data. Agreement rates were calculated at the individual variable level, category level and overall. Aggregate agreement rates are presented in the table in the original measure documentation. There were 14,854 total variables abstracted and of those 14,412 variables matched, resulting in an overall agreement rate of 97.02%. </p>
<p><strong>Process Variable Correlation Tables </strong></p>
<p>The relationships between process variables and overall agreement rates were examined and included: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Facility data collection performed from electronic medical records or a combination of paper and electronic medical records and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Facility data collection method (concurrent/retrospective/both) and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Data collection performed by a single abstractor or multiple staff and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Attendance at the annual data managers' meeting, STS Advances in Quality and Outcomes (AQO) Conference, and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Agreed upon abstraction location for data elements documented in multiple locations and overall agreement rate </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Relationship between Data Collection Source &amp; Agreement Rate</em> </p>
<p>Facilities using an electronic health record (EHR) for data collection had higher agreement rates, 97.36%, than those facilities using both paper medical records and an EHR, 96.31%. There were no facilities that used paper medical records alone (p less than 0.0004). </p>
<p><em>Relationship between Data Collection Method &amp; Agreement Rate </em></p>
<p>Facilities collecting data retrospectively have higher agreement rates, 97.55%, than those facilities collecting data concurrently, 96.18%, or both, 96.38% (p equal to or less than 0.0001).</p>
<p><em>Relationship between Data Collection Performed by a Single Abstractor or Multiple Staff &amp; Agreement Rate </em></p>
<p>Facilities with a single individual performing data abstraction have higher agreement rates, 98.02%, than those facilities that have multiple individuals performing data abstraction, 96.24% (p less than 0.0001). </p>
<p><em>Relationship between Attendance at AQO Conference &amp; Agreement Rate</em> </p>
<p>Facilities having staff attend the annual AQO Conference have higher agreement rates, 97.25%, than those that do not have staff attend, 96.11% (p less than 0.0012). </p>
<p><em>Relationship between Have an Agreed Upon Location &amp; Agreement Rate </em></p>
<p>Facilities that utilize an agreed upon location for data elements recorded in multiple locations have higher agreement rates, 97.31%, than facilities that do not utilize an agreed upon location, 93.61% (p less than 0.0001). </p>
<p>In addition, validity is regularly assessed by an expert panel of general thoracic surgeons assembled by the STS General Thoracic Surgery Database Task Force, the STS Quality Measurement Task Force, and the STS Task Force on Quality Initiatives, all of which report to the STS Workforce on National Databases.</p></div>
