Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Weak</strong>) and quality of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low, Very Low</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health question #1: What interventions are recommended to treat breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in children?</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Breakthrough CINV</em> is defined as nausea and/or vomiting presumed to be attributable to antineoplastic chemotherapy and with no other pathological cause that occurs during the acute or delayed phase despite CINV prophylaxis.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: For children receiving acute CINV prophylaxis recommended for minimally, low, or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, clinicians should upgrade or escalate the acute CINV prophylaxis provided to that recommended for chemotherapy of the next higher level of emetogenic risk. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Very Low Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: For children receiving acute CINV prophylaxis recommended for highly emetogenic chemotherapy, the Guideline Panel suggests that olanzapine be added to guideline-consistent CINV prophylaxis. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Low Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: For children receiving acute CINV prophylaxis recommended for highly emetogenic chemotherapy and who cannot receive olanzapine, the Guideline Panel suggests that one of the following antiemetic agents be added to guideline-consistent CINV prophylaxis:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Methotrimeprazine (also known as levomepromazine) or </li>
        <li>Metoclopramide (in children older than 1 year)
        <p>(<strong>Weak Recommendation, Very Low Quality Evidence</strong>) </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Given the possibility of extrapyramidal reactions with these agents, the risks and benefits of their use should be weighed carefully and coadministration of prophylaxis aimed at preventing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) should be considered. Patients and families should also be educated about the possible occurrence of EPS.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health question #2: What interventions are recommended to prevent CINV in children who have refractory CINV?</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Refractory CINV</em> is defined as nausea and/or vomiting presumed to be attributable to antineoplastic chemotherapy and with no other pathological cause which occurs during the acute or delayed phase despite CINV prophylaxis in patients who have experienced breakthrough CINV in a previous chemotherapy block.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: For children receiving acute CINV prophylaxis recommended for minimally, low, or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, clinicians should upgrade or escalate the acute CINV prophylaxis provided to that recommended for chemotherapy of the next higher level of emetogenic risk. (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Very Low Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li><em>Recommendation 2.2</em>: For children receiving acute CINV prophylaxis recommended for highly emetogenic chemotherapy, the Guideline Panel suggests that the 5-HT3 (serotonin) antagonist given for CINV prophylaxis be changed from ondansetron or granisetron to palonosetron. In jurisdictions where palonosetron is not available, the Guideline Panel suggests that granisetron be substituted for ondansetron. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Very Low Quality of Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li><em>Recommendation 2.3</em>: For children experiencing refractory CINV despite initiation of previous recommendations and who have not previously received aprepitant because it is known or suspected to interact with the chemotherapeutic agent(s) being given, the Guideline Panel suggests that the addition of aprepitant to acute CINV prophylaxis be considered. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Low Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li><em>Recommendation 2.4</em>: For children experiencing refractory CINV despite initiation of the previous recommendations, the Guideline Panel suggests that one of the following interventions be added to the CINV prophylaxis provided:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Interventions that were employed successfully for the treatment of breakthrough CINV in previous treatment blocks (olanzapine, methotrimeprazine or metoclopramide) (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Very Low Quality Evidence</strong>); or </li>
        <li>Stimulation of Nei Gaun (P6) by means of acupressure or electroacupuncture (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Very Low Quality Evidence</strong>) </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Literature Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>In March 2015, computerized searches (see Supplementary Table SI [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) were performed with the assistance of a library scientist to identify guidelines that could be endorsed for the treatment of breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and for the prevention of refractory CINV in children. A total of 4,451 citations were identified and screened. Since none met the inclusion criteria (see Table II in the original guideline document) for endorsement assessment, the guideline panel proceeded to develop a <em>de novo</em> guideline. Systematic reviews of primary studies evaluating interventions for the treatment of breakthrough CINV and the prevention of refractory CINV were conducted.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Identification and Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group searched for primary studies pertinent to the guideline topics (see Supplementary Tables SII and SIII [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) as of March 13, 2015. Eligibility was not restricted by age or language. All primary study designs, except single case reports, were eligible. Citations were screened independently by two reviewers. Conflicts were resolved by a third. Potentially relevant citations were included for full-text screening. Two reviewers independently evaluated the full-text papers to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria (see Table II in the original guideline document). Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer.</p>
<p>During the guideline development process, it became apparent that understanding the safety of specific medications in children with cancer was required to better inform recommendations. Therefore, systematic reviews evaluating the safety of metoclopramide and prochlorperazine were undertaken, and an existing systematic review of the safety of olanzapine in children was considered by the panel. Primary studies relating to the safety of methotrimeprazine in children were also searched (see Supplementary Table SIII [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) as of March 9, 2015 with the assistance of a library scientist. Citations were screened, full-text papers were evaluated to determine if they met the inclusion criteria (see Table II in the original guideline document).</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>No clinically significant adverse effects were reported in either study that evaluated olanzapine for the treatment of breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in adults. Dizziness, fatigue, and dyspepsia, described as mild and tolerable, were reported in one study. </li>
    <li>In a systematic review and meta-analysis, weight gain and sedation (78% [95% confidence interval (CI): 63% to 95%] and 48% [95% CI: 35% to 67%], respectively) were commonly associated with the use of olanzapine in children less than 13 years old. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and electrocardiograph abnormalities were reported less frequently (9% [95% CI: 4% to 21%] and 14% [95% CI: 7% to 26%], respectively). Most adverse effects associated with olanzapine use were of minor clinical significance; no fatalities attributable to olanzapine were identified. </li>
    <li>In one study, drowsiness, dry mouth, and constipation were the most commonly reported adverse effects of methotrimeprazine in adult psychiatric patients in one study. Sedation (12/32 patients), hypotension (8/32), and induration at the site of methotrimeprazine administration (32/32) were the most commonly reported adverse effects experienced by patients included in that study. </li>
    <li>Four studies (two retrospective reviews, one case series, and one case report) involving 30 children were included in a systematic review of the safety of methotrimeprazine in children (see Supplementary Table SV [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). No persistent adverse effects or fatalities were attributable to methotrimeprazine in these studies. </li>
    <li>In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse effects of metoclopramide in children, the mean proportion of children reported to have EPS was 9% (95% CI: 5% to 17%) or diarrhea was 6% (95% CI: 3% to 9%). In single dose and multiple-dose metoclopramide studies, the mean proportion of children reported to experience sedation was 2% (95% CI: 1% to 5%) and 6% (95% CI: 3% to 12%), respectively. </li>
    <li>The most commonly reported adverse effects of palonosetron reported by patients in one study were constipation and anxiety; no patient experienced severe toxicity. </li>
    <li>Aprepitant is a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C9/8 (CYP2C9/8) and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19). As a result, it may potentially interact with medications, including chemotherapy, metabolized via these pathways. Interactions with chemotherapy that may lead to an increased risk of short- and long-term toxicity are of primary concern. </li>
    <li>The potential improvement in CINV control offered by the addition of aprepitant should be weighed against the short- and long-term toxicities resulting from potential interactions with chemotherapy. It is essential to include the patient, when appropriate, and family in this discussion so their values can be incorporated into the decision-making process. The relative risks of aprepitant (potential for drug interaction with chemotherapy and altered chemotherapy exposure) and benefits (CINV control) should be determined on a case-by-case basis. </li>

Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Olanzapine should be avoided in patients receiving cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin) or inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) as olanzapine is primarily metabolized via this enzymatic pathway. </li>
    <li>Since Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency have recently issued warnings regarding the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in young children receiving metoclopramide, the panel recommends that metoclopramide be avoided in children less than 1-year old. </li>
