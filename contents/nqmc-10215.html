Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of computed tomography (CT) imaging reports for all patients, regardless of age, with the imaging study named according to a standardized nomenclature* and the standardized nomenclature is used in institution's computer systems, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Computerized physician ordering system </li>
    <li>Charge master </li>
    <li>Radiology information system </li>
    <li>Electronic health record </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">*Use of a standardized nomenclature is meant to enable reporting to a Dose Index Registry. There is no standard lexicon implemented across the board for naming CT exam procedures. To make like comparisons of sites reporting dose index data to a registry, it is necessary to use a specific CT exam name and standardize that across registry participants. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Promoting Effective Communication and Coordination of Care is one of the priorities in the <em>National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Health Care</em>, with great potential for rapidly improving health outcomes and increasing the effectiveness of care for all populations (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2011).</p>
<p>A uniform structure for capturing, indexing, and retrieving a variety of radiology information may facilitate the structured reporting of radiology reports. This will also permit mining of data for participation in research projects, registries, and quality improvement efforts (Kundu et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Standardized nomenclature may include RadLex&reg;. Other standardized nomenclature may be available and would be acceptable for this measure. RadLex&reg; is a controlled terminology for radiology&mdash;a single unified source of radiology terms that is designed to fill this need. The purpose of RadLex&reg; is to provide a uniform structure for capturing, indexing, and retrieving a variety of radiology information sources, such as teaching files and research data. This may facilitate a first step toward structured reporting of radiology reports. This will also permit mining of data for participation in research projects, registries, patient outcomes and quality assurance (Langlotz, 2006).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and/or other references</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Lexicon-Enabled Radiology Practice</span> (Radiological Society of North America [RSNA], 2009). <br />
As images, imaging reports and medical records move online, radiologists need a unified language to organize and retrieve them. Radiologists currently use a variety of terminologies and standards, but no single lexicon serves all of their needs.</p>
<p>The existence of a standardized lexicon for radiology enables numerous improvements in the clinical practice of radiology, starting with the ordering of imaging exams, through the use of information in the resulting radiology report. It also makes possible more effective reuse of information for research and educational purposes. Some specific uses of RadLex&reg; terminology include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Automatic order entry decision support</strong>. Because the names of imaging exams are described in consistent language, the applicability of appropriateness criteria developed by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and others can be determined automatically. </li>
    <li><strong>Vendor independent "protocoling" of complex imaging exams</strong>. Imaging exam protocols for computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) exams can be specified using vendor independent language. Consistent names for imaging exams and procedure steps (e.g., radiographic view, CT sequence, MR series) are used throughout the radiology practice. </li>
    <li><strong>Improved speech recognition accuracy</strong>. Because the exam descriptions are explicitly linked to the body site imaged and the modality used, speech recognition systems use this linkage information to improve recognition accuracy. </li>
    <li><strong>Real-time decision support for the radiologist</strong>. Because standardized terms are associated with radiology reports, these terms can trigger decision support tools for the radiologist. Decision support systems automatically retrieve case-relevant information in real time, such as checklists for image features to seek, additional differential diagnoses, or information from PubMed, the Internet, and proprietary decision support databases. </li>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
The use of medical imaging has resulted in revolutionary advances in the practice of medicine. The increased sophistication and clinical efficacy of imaging have resulted in its considerable growth. Consequently, the evolution of imaging has resulted in a significant increase in the population's cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation and a potential increase in adverse effects including cancer (Amis, Butler, &amp; American College of Radiology [ACR], 2010; Amis et al., 2007). Although experts may not agree on the extent of the risks of cancer from medical imaging, there is uniform agreement that care should be taken to weigh the medical necessity of a given level of radiation exposure against the risks, and that steps should be taken to eliminate avoidable exposure to radiation (Amis et al., 2007; Center for Devices and Radiological Health [CDRH], 2010).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">High Impact Topic Area</span><br />
This topic was chosen for measure development because of the high costs associated with imaging studies and because these medical procedures are a significant source of radiation exposure. The following objective data support the degree of increase in the use of imaging studies and emphasize the importance in taking steps to help eliminate avoidable exposure.</p>
<p><em>Prevalence and Incidence</em> </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The average per capita exposure to ionizing radiation from imaging exams increased by about 600% from 1980 to 2006 in the United States (U.S.) (Mettler et al., 2009; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements [NCRP], 2009). </li>
    <li>The largest contributor to this dramatic increase in population radiation exposure is computed tomography (CT). In 1980 fewer than 3 million CT scans were performed; in 2006, there were about 380 million radiologic procedures (including 67 million CT scans) and 18 million nuclear medicine procedures performed in the U.S. (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>The imaging study with the single highest radiation burden, accounting for 22% of cumulative effective dose, is myocardial perfusion imaging (Fazel et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, an estimated 19 million head, 10.6 million chest and 21.2 million abdominal and pelvic CT scans were performed accounting for 28%, 15.9%, and 31.7%, respectively, of the total number of CT scans in the U.S. (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>Currently, approximately 11% of CT examinations are performed on children, which could account for more than 7 million pediatric CT examinations per year in the U.S. (Mettler et al., 2000; Frush &amp; Applegate, 2004; Linton, Mettler, &amp; NCRP, 2003). </li>
    <li>The prevalence of CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use during emergency department (ED) visits for injury-related conditions increased from 6% in 1998 to 15% in 2007 (Korley, Pham, &amp; Kirsch, 2010). </li>
    <li>While CT utilization has decreased steadily since 2003 in pediatric facilities across North America (Townsend et al., 2010) the use of CT in children who visit the ED increased from 0.33 to 1.65 from 1995 to 2008 and occurred primarily at non-pediatric focused facilities (Larson et al., 2011). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Costs</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 2000 through 2006, total Medicare expenditures for physician imaging services increased from $6.7 billion to about $14 billion, an increase of 13% per year on average (U.S. Government Accountability Office [GAO], 2008). </li>
    <li>In 2005 imaging services represented an estimated 14% of 2005 spending included in the sustainable growth rate (SGR) calculation, but represented 27% of the total increase in such spending between 2004 and 2005. The majority of the growth occurred for advanced imaging (GAO, 2008). </li>
    <li>In 2006, advanced imaging, including CT and MRI, accounted for 54% of total Medicare imaging expenditures, up from 43% in 2000. This translates to an increase in Medicare spending on advanced imaging from about $3 billion in 2000 to about $7.6 billion in 2006 (GAO, 2008). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disparities</em> <br />
There is variation according to age, sex, and health care market in the proportion and mean dose of patients undergoing medical imaging procedures. One study concluded that the proportion of subjects undergoing at least one imaging procedure was higher in older patients, rising from 49.5% of those who were 18 to 34 years old to 85.9% of those who were 60 to 64 years old. The study also found that women underwent procedures significantly more often than men, with a total of 78.7% of women undergoing at least one procedure during the study period, as compared with 57.9% of men (Fazel et al., 2009).</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
One retrospective cross-sectional study describing radiation dose associated with some of the most common types of diagnostic CT found variable radiation doses. The study found variability in the following exams: 1) routine chest exam without contrast, the CT effective doses ranged from 2 mSv to 24 mSv; 2) routine abdomen-pelvis, no contrast - CT effective dose ranged from 3 mSv to 43 mSv; 3) routine head exam - CT effective dose ranging from 0.3 mSv to 6 mSv (Smith-Bindman et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Radiologists currently use a variety of terminologies and standards, but no single lexicon serves all of their needs (Kundu et al., 2008). Terminology is increasingly vital to the practice of medicine. Many of the benefits of clinical information technology cannot be realized unless information is stored using standard terms in a structured format (Kundu et al., 2009; Kahn et al., 2009).</p></div>

<p class="Note">*Use of a standardized nomenclature is meant to enable reporting to a Dose Index Registry. There is no standard lexicon implemented across the board for naming CT exam procedures. To make like comparisons of sites reporting dose index data to a registry, it is necessary to use a specific CT exam name and standardize that across registry participants.</p>
