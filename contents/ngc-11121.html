    <li><strong>In emergency department (ED) patients with suspected acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, can noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) measurement be used to accurately diagnose CO toxicity?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. Do not use noninvasive COHb measurement (pulse CO oximetry) to diagnose CO toxicity in patients with suspected acute CO poisoning.</p>

    <li><strong>In ED patients diagnosed with acute CO poisoning, does hyperbaric oxygen (HBO<sub>2</sub>) therapy as compared with normobaric oxygen therapy improve long-term neurocognitive outcomes?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. Emergency physicians should use HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy or high-flow normobaric therapy for acute CO-poisoned patients. It remains unclear whether HBO<sub>2 </sub>therapy is superior to normobaric oxygen therapy for improving long-term neurocognitive outcomes.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. In ED patients with moderate to severe CO poisoning, obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac biomarker levels to identify acute myocardial injury, which can predict poor outcome.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Classes of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least 2 methodologists and assigned a Class of Evidence. Each article was assigned a design class, with design 1 representing the strongest study design and subsequent design classes (e.g., design 2, design 3) representing respectively weaker study designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic clinical reports, or meta-analyses (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, such as randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, sample size, and generalizability. Using a predetermined process related to the study's design, methodological quality, and applicability to the critical question, articles received a final Class of Evidence grade (i.e., Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles identified with fatal flaws or that were ultimately not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade "X" and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the specific critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question for which it is being considered. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different Classes of Evidence as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-specific Classes of Evidence grading may be found in the Evidentiary Table in the original guideline document.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of <em>Annals of Emergency Medicine</em> and its editors. </li>
    <li>This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected or diagnosed carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. </li>
    <li>It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain adequate empirical data to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. </li>
    <li>This clinical policy is not intended to represent a legal standard of care for emergency physicians. Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic or management options available to the emergency physician. ACEP recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment and patient preferences. This guideline defines for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the critical questions addressed in this policy. </li>
