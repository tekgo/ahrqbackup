Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low, Very Low</strong>) and grades of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Weak, Good Practice Point</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 1</span></strong> </p>
<p>The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) strongly recommends rate control in preference to rhythm control for the majority of patients who have atrial fibrillation (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>). Preferred options for rate-control therapy include non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers. Rhythm control may be considered for certain patients based on patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preferences (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 2</span></strong> </p>
<p>The AAFP recommends lenient rate control (&lt;110 beats per minute resting) over strict rate control (&lt;80 beats per minute resting) for patients who have atrial fibrillation (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>). </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 3</span></strong> </p>
<p>The AAFP recommends that clinicians discuss the risk of stroke and bleeding with all patients considering anticoagulation (<strong>good practice point</strong>). Clinicians should consider using the continuous CHADS<sub>2</sub> (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75+, Diabetes mellitus, prior Stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolic event) or continuous CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75+, Diabetes mellitus, prior Stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolic event, Vascular disease, Age 65-74, Sex category) for prediction of risk of stroke (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>) and HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly [&gt;65 years], Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) for prediction of risk for bleeding (<strong>weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>) in patients who have atrial fibrillation. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 4</span></strong></p>
<p>The AAFP strongly recommends that patients who have atrial fibrillation receive chronic anticoagulation unless they are at low risk of stroke (CHADS<sub>2</sub> &lt;2) or have specific contraindications (<strong>strong recommendation, high-quality evidence</strong>). Choice of anticoagulation therapy should be based on patient preferences and patient history. Options for anticoagulation therapy may include warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation 5</span></strong></p>
<p>The AAFP strongly recommends against dual treatment with anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in most patients who have atrial fibrillation (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Reviews</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2013, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published two comparative effectiveness reviews. The first report, <em>Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation: Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 119</em>, reviewed the evidence for pharmacologic and surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. The second review, <em>Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 123</em>, reviewed the evidence for different anticoagulation strategies for patients with atrial fibrillation. These reports were based on literature searches from January 1, 2000, to August 14, 2012. Refer to the systematic reviews (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for search information and results.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>A targeted, updated literature search using the same search criteria outlined in AHRQ reports was completed by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) medical librarian. The updated search resulted in 217 articles spanning the time from the completion of the AHRQ reports in 2012 through December 31, 2015. The search strategy is outlined in Appendix A of the original guideline document. Two reviewers independently examined citations and abstracts using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria that were used in the AHRQ evidence reports. A full text article was reviewed if at least one reviewer thought it should be included. This resulted in the review of 91 full text articles. Following exclusion of 48 articles, the remaining 43 articles underwent assessment for risk of bias and study quality. Each relevant study was rated for quality (good, fair, poor) by at least two independent reviewers using the approach outlined by the AHRQ <em>Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews</em>. In keeping with the AHRQ methods, only studies that were rated as good or fair were included for consideration. Studies rated as poor were not included. For this updated evidence review, 16 articles were included (see Appendix B in the original guideline). The updated literature search resulted in the inclusion of one additional RCT with a new medication (edoxaban) that was not addressed in the AHRQ report on stroke prevention. This RCT was used to inform Recommendation 4 on options for chronic anticoagulation. The other studies found in the updated search were observational and secondary analyses of RCTs included in the AHRQ reports. These additional studies did not change the conclusions from the original AHRQ evidence reports. However, these analyses were considered by the panel in determining the recommendations and are discussed in the guideline text as appropriate.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Differences from Previous Guideline</strong></span></p>
<p>This guideline updates and replaces an earlier guideline published in 2003 from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the American College of Physicians, which was reaffirmed by the AAFP in 2008. The topic was nominated to the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for an updated evidence review in 2011. Changes in the methodology and scope of the guideline include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Adding a consumer/patient representative </li>
    <li>Including evidence for new direct oral anticoagulants </li>
    <li>Including evidence on strict versus lenient rate control </li>
    <li>Narrowing the scope of the guideline to focus solely on pharmacologic management </li>
    <li>Adding a recommendation on risk assessment for stroke </li>
    <li>Adding shared decision-making tools to compare treatment options for rate control and anticoagulation </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Systematic Review</strong></span></p>
<p>In 2013, AHRQ published two comparative effectiveness reviews. The first report, <em>Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation: Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 119</em>, reviewed the evidence for pharmacologic and surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. The second review, <em>Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 123</em>, reviewed the evidence for different anticoagulation strategies for patients with atrial fibrillation. These reports were based on literature searches from January 1, 2000, to August 14, 2012.</p>
<p>The scope of the AHRQ reports was reviewed, and the panel chose to focus on the following key questions that they considered most relevant to primary care practice:</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key question (KQ) 1</strong>: What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of pharmacological agents used for ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation? Do the comparative safety and effectiveness of these therapies differ among specific patient subgroups of interest?</p>
<p><strong>KQ2</strong>: What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of a strict rate-control strategy versus a more lenient rate-control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation? Do the comparative safety and effectiveness of these therapies differ among specific patient subgroups of interest?</p>
<p><strong>KQ6</strong>: What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of rate-control therapies compared with rhythm-control therapies in patients with atrial fibrillation? Do the comparative safety and effectiveness of these therapies differ among specific patient subgroups of interest?</p>
<p><strong>Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation</strong></p>
<p><strong>KQ1</strong>: In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, what are the comparative diagnostic accuracy and impact on clinical decision making (diagnostic thinking, therapeutic, and patient outcome efficacy) of available clinical and imaging tools for predicting thromboembolic risk?</p>
<p><strong>KQ2</strong>: In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, what are the comparative diagnostic accuracy and impact on clinical decision making (diagnostic thinking, therapeutic, and patient outcome efficacy) of clinical tools and associated risk factors for predicting bleeding events?</p>
<p><strong>KQ3</strong>: What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of specific anticoagulation therapies, antiplatelet therapies, and procedural interventions for preventing thromboembolic events:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="a">
    <li>In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation? </li>
    <li>In specific subpopulations of patients with nonvalvular fibrillation? </li>
</ol>
<p>The sections of the AHRQ evidence reports relevant to these key questions were reviewed and used as the foundation for the AAFP's recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Constructing the Guideline</strong></span></p>
<p>The AAFP's Commission on Health of the Public and Science appointed a guideline development group (GDG) to update the guideline. Specifics on the guideline development panel and process can be found in the <em>AAFP Clinical Practice Guideline Manual</em> (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The GDG reviewed the 2003 guideline and the two AHRQ evidence reports. The panel evaluated each recommendation from the guideline and determined those that would be included in the update. The GDG determined that the recommendations for pharmacologic treatment of atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation were the most relevant for family physicians.</p>
<p>The evidence from the systematic reviews was evaluated using a modified version of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to rate the quality of the evidence for each outcome and the overall strength of each recommendation. GRADE uses the term "strength of recommendation" to rate the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh the undesirable effects and reflect the degree to which there is evidence of improved patient-oriented health outcomes (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). The GRADE system also provides opportunities to issue guideline recommendations without a rating when appropriate (e.g., those that will be helpful to a clinician but for which there is no direct evidence to support the recommendation). These statements are labeled by the AAFP as "good practice points."</p>
<p>Guideline recommendations were finalized based on consensus of the GDG. Patient-oriented outcomes were prioritized in the guideline recommendations. Outcomes assessed included maintenance of ventricular rate and sinus rhythm; symptom relief; quality of life; all-cause and cardiovascular mortality; stroke; systemic embolism; cardiovascular events; hospitalizations; major and minor bleeding; and other adverse events due to medications. The recommendations were worded to reflect the strength and direction of the recommendation, and the quality of the evidence was listed parenthetically.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant independent risk factor for stroke, causing 15% to 20% of ischemic strokes. Prophylactic treatment with anticoagulants has proven to be highly effective for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF. Vitamin K antagonists have been used successfully for more than 50 years and are considered to be the gold standard for anticoagulant therapy. Direct anticoagulants provide additional options for stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF. The risks, benefits, and burdens related to cost and quality of life are outlined in Table 5 of the original guideline document. Patients with multiple comorbidities&mdash;including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, renal impairment, and cerebrovascular disease&mdash;were included in the studies. There is insufficient evidence to assess these subpopulations to determine their individual benefit from anticoagulation. Dose modifications may be required for patients with renal insufficiency, depending on the degree of renal impairment.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Prior to initiating treatment, clinicians should discuss the benefits and harms of the different anticoagulants, including potential medication cost and lifestyle modifications. Risk of bleeding should also be discussed. Careful risk assessment is essential, as patients with a low risk of stroke may not be appropriate for anticoagulation. Due to the increased risk of bleeding, dual therapy with aspirin and anticoagulants should be avoided.</p>
<p>See Table 5 in the original guideline for risks of oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. See Table 6 in the original guideline for risks of dual therapy.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>These recommendations are provided only as assistance for clinicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. All American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guidelines are scheduled for a review five years after completion or sooner if new evidence becomes available.</p>
<p>This guideline was developed using available evidence; however, gaps were identified. New research into these areas may affect the recommendations, at which time the guideline will be updated accordingly. Research gaps that would provide important information are provided in the original guideline document. </p></div>
