<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of recommendation (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak/conditional</strong>) and levels of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong> or <strong>very low</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department with signs of life after penetrating thoracic injury (P), does emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) versus resuscitation without EDT (C) improve hospital survival and neurologically intact hospital survival (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Despite <strong>moderate overall quality of evidence</strong> (see Fig. 1 in the original guideline document) for both critical outcomes, subcommittee panelists believed that patients would strongly favor undergoing EDT in this clinical scenario because of the substantial improvements in both survival and neurologically intact survival over patients resuscitated without EDT. For these reasons, a <strong>strong recommendation</strong> was made, implying that most patients would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not.</p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department with signs of life after penetrating thoracic injury, the panel <strong>strongly recommends</strong> that patients undergo EDT. This recommendation is based on <strong>moderate quality of evidence</strong> and places emphasis on patient preference for improved survival and neurologically intact survival after EDT.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department without signs of life after penetrating thoracic injury (P), does EDT versus resuscitation without EDT (C) improve hospital survival and neurologically intact hospital survival (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Despite <strong>moderate overall quality of evidence</strong> for both critical outcomes (see Fig. 2 in the original guideline document) subcommittee panelists believed that a majority of patients would favor undergoing EDT in this clinical scenario because of the improvements in both survival and neurologically intact survival over patients resuscitated without EDT. The panel recognizes that the duration of time without signs of life is a vital component to the decision-making process, but an evidentiary basis for exact length of arrest times is extremely limited. For these reasons, a <strong>conditional recommendation</strong> is made, implying that, although most patients would want the recommended course of action, others would not.</p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department without signs of life after penetrating thoracic injury, the panel <strong>conditionally recommends</strong> that patients undergo EDT. This recommendation is based on <strong>moderate quality of evidence</strong> and places emphasis on patient preference for improved survival and neurologically intact survival after EDT but also acknowledges that elapsed time without signs of life is an important component.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department with signs of life after penetrating extrathoracic injury (P), does EDT versus resuscitation without EDT (C) improve hospital survival and neurologically intact hospital survival (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Despite <strong>moderate overall quality of evidence</strong> for both critical outcomes (see Fig. 3 in original guideline document), subcommittee panelists believed that a majority of patients would favor undergoing EDT in this clinical scenario because of the improvements in both survival and neurologically intact survival over patients resuscitated without EDT. The panel recognizes that all extrathoracic injury locations such as the neck, abdomen, and extremities may not have equivalent salvage rates after EDT. For these reasons, a <strong>conditional recommendation</strong> is made.</p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department with signs of life after penetrating extrathoracic injury, the panel <strong>conditionally recommends</strong> that patients undergo EDT. This recommendation does not pertain to patients with isolated cranial injuries. This recommendation is based on <strong>moderate quality of evidence</strong> and places emphasis on patient preference for improved survival and neurologically intact survival after EDT but also acknowledges that penetrating injuries to all extrathoracic anatomic areas will not have equivalent salvage rates after EDT.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department without signs of life after penetrating extrathoracic injury (P), does EDT versus resuscitation without EDT (C) improve hospital survival and neurologically intact hospital survival (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Although all voting members of the subcommittee sought a conditional recommendation, 11 members voted in favor of EDT and 4 voted against the procedure based on the PICO No. 4 Evidence Profile. Group disagreement and <strong>low quality of evidence</strong> for both critical outcomes (see Fig. 4 in original guideline document) led to a <strong>conditional recommendation</strong>.</p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department without signs of life after penetrating extrathoracic injury, the panel <strong>conditionally recommends</strong> that patients undergo EDT. This recommendation does not pertain to patients with isolated cranial injuries and is based on <strong>low quality of evidence</strong>. The majority of subcommittee members believed that most patients would prefer undergoing EDT in hopes of improved survival and neurologically intact survival.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department with signs of life after blunt injury (P), does EDT versus resuscitation without EDT (C) improve hospital survival and neurologically intact hospital survival (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>With a <strong>moderate overall quality of evidence</strong> for both critical outcomes (see Fig. 5 in the original guideline document), subcommittee panelists believed that most patients would favor undergoing EDT in this clinical scenario because of the improvements in both survival and neurologically intact survival over patients resuscitated without EDT. However, the subcommittee recognizes that many patients would not want to undergo EDT after blunt injury because of the possibility of concomitant severe traumatic brain injury and poor neurologic outcome in survivors.</p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department with signs of life after blunt injury, the panel <strong>conditionally recommends</strong> that patients undergo EDT. This recommendation is based on <strong>moderate quality of evidence</strong> and places emphasis on patient preference for improved survival and neurologically intact survival after EDT.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department without signs of life after blunt injury (P), does EDT versus resuscitation without EDT (C) improve hospital survival and neurologically intact hospital survival (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Although subcommittee members unanimously voted against the performance of EDT based on the PICO No. 6 Evidence Profile, 10 members voted for a "strong" recommendation and 5 voted for a "conditional" recommendation. Group disagreement regarding the recommendation strength and <strong>low quality of evidence</strong> for both critical outcomes (see Fig. 6 in original guideline document) led to a <strong>conditional recommendation</strong>. Subcommittee panelists believed that a majority of patients would not favor undergoing EDT in this clinical scenario because of the dismal survival and likelihood of poor neurologic outcome.</p>
<p>In patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department without signs of life after blunt injury, the panel <strong>conditionally recommends</strong> against the performance of EDT. This recommendation is based on <strong>low quality of evidence</strong> and reflects subcommittee group disagreement regarding the strength of the unanimous recommendation against EDT.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inclusion Criteria for This Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Study Types</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of making recommendations, studies included prospective observational or retrospective studies without controls and case series.</p>
<p><strong>Participant Types</strong></p>
<p>All patients who underwent emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, or comorbidities were included. Only studies that involved resuscitative EDT were included, whereas those involving either prehospital resuscitative thoracotomy or operating room thoracotomy were excluded from the analysis. Meta analyses, reviews without original data, case reports, and letters were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Intervention Type</strong></p>
<p>The authors included studies in which EDT was performed in the above populations with the above measured outcomes. No direct comparator population exists in the literature; therefore, baseline risk of hospital survival for patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department with each of the above conditions was estimated by the subcommittee as presented in the Evidence Profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measure Types</strong></p>
<p>Relevant outcomes including hospital survival, neurologically intact hospital survival, health care personnel exposure to blood-borne pathogens, and costs were independently rated by each individual member of the subcommittee. Only hospital survival and neurologically intact hospital survival were deemed "critical" outcomes necessary to decision making, whereas blood-borne pathogen exposure was "moderately" important and costs were of minimal importance to the group. However, the authors recognize that exposure is an important consideration for many clinicians when deciding whether or not to perform an EDT and a review of the topic is included in the present article for reference.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Electronic Search</strong></p>
<p>A systematic search using the PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed using the following combination of the Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms and related key words: thoracotomy, emergency medical services, emergency treatment, emergencies, emergency room, emergency department, emergency service, and emergency ward. The guideline committee included only articles available in English. Bibliographies of included studies were also reviewed to find potential additional articles for study inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Titles and abstracts from the electronic search were screened for relevance to each Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) question. Studies initially deemed relevant for inclusion then underwent full text review by the subcommittee to determine final appropriateness for inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Study Definition: Signs of Life</strong></p>
<p>Signs of life, often used interchangeably with vital signs, were defined for the present study as defined by American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma in 2001. Signs of life were considered present with any of the following: pupillary response, spontaneous ventilation, presence of carotid pulse, measureable or palpable blood pressure, extremity movement, or cardiac electrical activity.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results</span></strong></p>
<p>The literature search yielded 2,152 studies of which 2,031 were removed after title and abstract review. The subcommittee reviewed 121 full articles of which 48 were excluded (24 operating room thoracotomy studies, 8 prehospital resuscitative thoracotomy studies, 16 studies did not address PICO questions or chosen outcomes).</p></div>

<p><strong>Data Extraction and Management</strong></p>
<p>Data were extracted using a standardized Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and consisted of the study authors, location, publication year, journal, methodology, and the relevant outcome measures with respect to emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) survival predictors. All entered data were checked in triplicate to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Methodological Quality</strong></p>
<p>The articles were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system and documented in each Evidence Profile figure. The quality of evidence was evaluated for each of the following domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.</p>
<p><strong>Measures of Treatment Effect</strong></p>
<p>Data on hospital survival and neurologically intact survival after EDT were collected from the included studies. The 95% confidence intervals for these event rates were calculated using the exact mid-P method. As described, no comparison or control group (i.e., no survival or neurologically intact survival data for similar groups of patients who did not undergo EDT) was available for the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) questions of interest and prompted thorough consultation with GRADE methodology experts. Relative effects and risk differences were then estimated by comparing the event rates with EDT with the expected probability of survival without EDT as estimated by the subcommittee. To this end, individual subcommittee members were polled to predict patient survival without EDT but with standard resuscitation including large bore access, blood product and crystalloid infusion, thoracostomy tube placement, and emergent transport to the operative suite as necessary for each PICO. One high and low outlier response was excluded for each PICO and the remaining responses used to calculate the mean estimated probability of survival without EDT. These estimates were then presented as the comparison group for each PICO. Without a control group in each constituent study, meta-analyses, assessments of heterogeneity, and confidence intervals for relative treatment effects were not calculable as a result.</p>
<p>Before evaluating the combinations of survival predictors for each PICO question, an analysis of each individual EDT survival predictor alone was undertaken across all 72 studies and presented in Table 1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Please refer to the original guideline document for details of the qualitative synthesis performed for each PICO question.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>When treating moribund trauma victims presenting in extremis, clinicians are forced to make immediate life-or-death decisions for their patients&mdash;decisions that attempt to balance the last chance of survival with the risk of salvaging patients with severe anoxic encephalopathy or exposing health care providers to blood-borne pathogens. </li>
    <li>When needlestick or cut exposure transmission rates (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], 0.3%; hepatitis B virus [HBV], 6% to 30%; hepatitis C virus [HCV], 1.8% [0% to 7%]) from known seropositive blood are considered, it is imperative that universal precautions are maintained for all resuscitations. </li>

Qualifying Statements

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad Hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment </li>
    <li>These guidelines represent a very detailed summary of the literature regarding emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) after six common clinical presentation scenarios. The vast majority of studies used within these guidelines are from major urban Trauma Centers&mdash;as such, their data and the resulting recommendations may not be applicable to community or rural centers. The guidelines are intended to inform the decision-making process rather than replace clinical judgment. </li>
