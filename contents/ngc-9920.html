<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Applicability Issues</strong></p>
<p>In order to provide adequate provision of diabetes survival skills, the inpatient unit must be able to provide educational tools that outline diabetes self-management "survival skills." During orientation, new staff members must have extensive exposure to and education about these same "survival skills" and understand to not teach them to caregivers until they are competent to do so. The unit must also be able to provide adequate staffing to allow time for intensive supportive care and education to new onset families on the inpatient unit. To assure the caregivers are prepared for safe discharged after education and emotional support is provided, accurate documentation in the patient education record to record completion of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) education topics and psychosocial Patient Plan of Care template must be charted. Lastly, the inpatient nursing staff should be well versed in conversational and interpersonal techniques that provide emotional support to caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers</strong></p>
<p>Potential barriers to providing diabetes survival skills, comforting presence, and reassurance by staff are allocation of resources to compile and provide teaching materials to caregivers, decreased staff motivation to learn conversational and interpersonal techniques to promote emotionally supportive behaviors, and allocation of funds to appropriately staff the inpatient unit to staff numbers that allow time for intensive supportive nursing and educational sessions.</p></div>
