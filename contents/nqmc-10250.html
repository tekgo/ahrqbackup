<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>People with epilepsy are at a greater risk for injury and accidents (England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). Providing patients or caregivers with personalized epilepsy safety issue information and education will increase personal safety while promoting self-management and improving quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>At the time of initial seizure evaluation, the patient should receive information on driving restrictions, safety and injury prevention (Pugh et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Patients with epilepsy should receive an annual review of information including topics such as: chronic effects of epilepsy and its treatment including drug side-effects, drug-drug interactions, effect on bone health; contraception, family planning, and how pregnancy and menopause may affect seizures; screening for mood disorders; triggers and lifestyle issues that may affect seizures; impact of epilepsy on other chronic and acute diseases; driving and safety issues (Pugh et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Adults should receive appropriate information and education about all aspects of epilepsy. This may be best achieved and maintained through structured self-management plans (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2012). </li>
    <li>Healthcare professionals should adopt a consulting style that enables the child, young person or adult with epilepsy, and their family and/or carers as appropriate, to participate as partners in all decisions about their healthcare, and take fully into account their race, culture, and any specific needs (NICE, 2012). Children, young people and adults with epilepsy and their families and/or carers should be given, and have access to sources of, information about (where appropriate): epilepsy in general; diagnosis and treatment options; medication and side effects; seizure type(s), triggers, and seizure control; management and self-care; risk management; first aid, safety and injury prevention at home and at school or work; psychological issues; social security benefits and social services; insurance issues; education and healthcare at school; employment and independent living for adults; importance of disclosing epilepsy at work, if relevant (if further information or clarification is needed, voluntary organizations should be contacted.); road safety and driving; prognosis; sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP); status epilepticus; life style, leisure and social issues (including recreational drugs, alcohol, sexual activity, and sleep deprivation); family planning and pregnancy; voluntary organizations, such as support groups and charitable organizations, and how to contact them. The time at which this information should be given will depend on the certainty of the diagnosis and the need for confirmatory investigations (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>If children, young people and adults and families and/or carers have not already found high-quality information from voluntary organizations and other sources, healthcare professionals should inform them of different sources (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Adequate time should be set aside in the consultation to provide information, which should be revisited on subsequent consultations (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Checklists should be used to remind children, young people and adults, and healthcare professionals, about information that should be discussed during consultations (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Everyone providing care or treatment for children, young people and adults with epilepsy should be able to provide essential information (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>The child, young person or adult with epilepsy and their family and/or carers as appropriate should know how to contact a named individual when information is needed. This named individual should be a member of the healthcare team and be responsible for ensuring that the information needs of the child, young person or adult and/or their family and/or carers are met (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>The possibility of having seizures should be discussed, and information on epilepsy should be provided before seizures occur, for children, young people and adults at high risk of developing seizures (such as after severe brain injury), with a learning disability, or who have a strong family history of epilepsy (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Children, young people and adults with epilepsy should be given appropriate information before they make important decisions (for example, regarding pregnancy or employment) (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Information on SUDEP should be included in literature on epilepsy to show why preventing seizures is important. Tailored information on the person's relative risk of SUDEP should be part of the counselling checklist for children, young people and adults with epilepsy and their families and/or carers (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Adults with well-controlled epilepsy may have specific medical or lifestyle issues (for example, pregnancy or drug cessation) that may need the advice of a specialist (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>At the (annual) review, children, young people and adults should have access to: written and visual information; counselling services; information about voluntary organizations; epilepsy specialist nurses; timely and appropriate investigations; referral to tertiary services including surgery, where appropriate (NICE, 2012). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Research has demonstrated that people with epilepsy do not have a solid understanding of basic information about epilepsy, including knowledge about their diagnosis, seizure precipitants or triggers, specific seizure types(s), the purpose and potential side effects of seizure medications, safety concerns, and the risks of seizures (England et al., 2012; Long et al., 2000; Fraser et al., 2011; Sare et al., 2007; Tatum, Worley, &amp; Selenica, 2012; Wicks &amp; Fountain, 2012). Children and adolescents with epilepsy need increasing tailored knowledge about their condition over time (England et al., 2012). People with epilepsy, their families, and caregivers want more information than they currently receive (England et al., 2012; American Medical Association [AMA], 2014). Information and education should be provided in the best manner to meet their specific situations as patients maybe too ashamed or intimidated to request this information (England et al., 2012; AMA, 2014).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy data is lacking. In 2012, the Institute of Medicine released <em>Epilepsy across the Spectrum: Promoting Health and Understanding</em>, detailing epilepsy research disparities and highlighting specific areas where further research is needed, including the extent of epilepsy, consequences, comorbid conditions and outcomes of epilepsy (England et al., 2012). The following statistics only touch on the magnitude of epilepsy given lack of research and stigma: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It is estimated 2.2 million people in the United States are diagnosed with epilepsy, and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the United States annually (England et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Epilepsy prevalence might be underestimated because of underreporting associated with repercussions and stigma in disclosing epilepsy (Kobau et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Common comorbidities among people with epilepsy include somatic (i.e., fractures, asthma, diabetes, and heart disease), neurological (i.e., stroke, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, chronic pain), and mental health conditions (i.e., mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, anxiety disorders, suicidality) (England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>It is estimated the number of people with epilepsy who die of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) range from 1 of every 10,000 who are newly diagnosed to 9 of every 1,000 candidates for epilepsy surgery (England et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>People with epilepsy are more likely to be unemployed or unable to work, have low annual household incomes, be obese and physically inactive, and to smoke (England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>People with epilepsy have poorer overall health status, impaired intellectual and physical functioning, a greater risk for accidents and injuries, and negative side effects from seizure medications (Fountain et al., 2011; England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>It is estimated the annual direct medical cost of epilepsy in the United States is $9.6 billion. This estimate does not include community service costs or indirect costs from losses in quality of life and productivity (England et al., 2012). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunities for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Additional data on opportunities for improvement and gaps in care specific to the epilepsy measures can be located in the updated epilepsy measures. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A review of 261 patient responses using the PatientsLikeMe survey system indicated a gap remains between recommended care detailed in the 2009 epilepsy measurement set and the care delivered to patients with epilepsy (Wicks &amp; Fountain, 2012). </li>
    <li>The Institute of Medicine noted several gaps in care and opportunities for improvement, including 1) timely referrals and access to treatments, 2) epilepsy care and prevention, 3) education of persons with epilepsy and their families, and 4) the stigma of epilepsy (England et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Surgery continues to be heavily underutilized as a treatment for epilepsy, with significant disparities by race and insurance coverage (Englot et al., 2012). </li>
