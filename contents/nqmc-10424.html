<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of uncomplicated cataract who had cataract surgery and had any of a specified list of surgical procedures in the 30 days following cataract surgery which would indicate the occurrence of any of the following major complications: retained nuclear fragments, endophthalmitis, dislocated or wrong power intraocular lens (IOL), retinal detachment, or wound dehiscence.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Complications that may result in a permanent loss of vision following cataract surgery are uncommon. This short-term outcome of surgery indicator seeks to identify those complications from surgery that can reasonably be attributed to the surgery and surgeon and which reflect situations which - if untreated - generally result in significant avoidable vision loss that would negatively impact patient functioning. Further, it seeks to reduce surgeon burden and enhance accuracy in reporting by focusing on those significant complications that can be assessed from administrative data alone and which can be captured by the care of another physician or the provision of additional, separately coded, postoperative services. Finally, it focuses on patient safety and monitoring for events that, while hopefully uncommon, can signify important issues in the care being provided. For example, the need to reposition or exchange an intraocular lens (IOL) reflects in part "wrong power" IOL placement, a major patient safety issue. </p>
<p>In order to achieve these ends, the indicator excludes patients with other known, pre-operative ocular conditions that could impact the likelihood of developing a complication. Based on the results of the Cataract Appropriateness Project at RAND, other published studies, and one analysis performed on a national Managed Care Organizations (MCO) data base, the exclusion codes would preserve over 2/3 of all cataract surgery cases for analysis. Thus, this provides a "clean" indicator that captures care for the large majority of patients undergoing cataract surgery.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>This is an outcome measure. As such, there are no statements in the guideline specific to this measurement topic.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>The advances in technology and surgical skills over the last 30 years have made cataract surgery much safer and more effective although complications that threaten vision do occur. For example, a study of more than 220,000 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent cataract surgery between 1994 and 2006 found that more than 1,000, or about 0.5%, of patients had at least one severe postoperative complication (American Academy of Ophthalmology [AAO], 2011).</p>
<p>In a review, Taban et al. (2005) found a postoperative rate of endophthalmitis of 0.128%.</p>
<p>Additionally, in a review of Medicare claims data between 1994 and 2006, Stein et al. (2011) reported a one-year postoperative rate of retinal detachment of 0.26%.</p>
<p>The occurrence of one of these events is associated with a significant potential for vision loss that is otherwise avoidable. With an annual volume of 2.8 million cataract surgeries in the U.S., a 2% rate would mean that over 36,000 surgeries are accompanied by these complications. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on several measure testing projects in 2012 and 2015 to ensure the Cataracts &ndash; Complications within 30 Days Following Cataracts Surgery measure and Cataracts &ndash; 20/40 or Better Visual Acuity within 90 Days Following Cataracts Surgery measures are reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator and exception case identification. The testing projects were conducted utilizing electronic health record data and registry data. Parallel forms reliability and signal-to-noise reliability were tested. One site participated in the parallel forms testing of the measures. Site A was a physician-owned multi-location suburban practice in a large Midwestern city with four physicians. Signal-to-noise reliability was assessed using 2013 data acquired from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Physician Quality Reporting System Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) database. An analysis of the measure exclusions was conducted using 2013 Medicare 5% Beneficiary claims data.</p>
<p><strong>Cataracts &ndash; Complications within 30 Days Following Cataracts Surgery</strong></p>
<p><em>Reliability Testing Results</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parallel Forms Reliability Testing (Site A)</span></p>
<p>There were 149 observations from one site used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide by zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used.</p>
<p>Of the 149 observations that were initially selected, 149 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.00 demonstrates poor agreement between the automated report and reviewer. However, upon further review of the testing results, it was determined that the low kappa score results from the limitation of the kappa statistic where while the agreement can be 90% or greater, if one classification category dominates, the kappa can be significantly reduced. </p>
<p>Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval)<br />
Denominator: 149, 100.0%, Non-Calculable* (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)* <br />
Numerator: 149, 99.3%, 0.00 (-0.02, 0.00)** </p>
<p class="Note">*Cannot calculate kappa statistics when only one response (Yes/Yes) was used, as this causes a divide-by-zero error in the statistic formula.</p>
<p class="Note">**This is an example of the limitation of the Kappa statistic. While the agreement can be 90% or greater, if one classification category dominates, the kappa can be significantly reduced.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signal-to-Noise Reliability Testing</span></p>
<p>For this measure, the reliability at the minimum level of quality reporting events (10) was 0.87. The average number of quality reporting events for physicians included is 53.3. The reliability at the average number of quality reporting events was 0.97. </p>
<p>This measure has high reliability when evaluated at the minimum level of quality reporting events and high reliability at the average number of quality events. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exclusions Analysis</span><br />
Medicare 5% Beneficiary claims data sample, there were 46,715 unique individuals who had a cataract procedure in the first nine months of 2013 with a total of 70,773 procedures. Using the criteria for the measure, 36,988 (52.2%) procedures had a cataract measure exclusion associated with the procedure.</p></div>
