</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The literature was searched using MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 4 2013) and EMBASE (1974 to 2013 Week 29) databases in OVID. The search strategy combined disease-specific terms (exp epilepsy/ or epilep$.ti,ab.) with intervention-specific terms (exp tomography, emission computed/ or pet or positron emission tomograph$ or positron-emission),ti, ab.). See Appendix 1 in the original guideline document for the search strategy.</p>
<p>In addition, annual meetings of the American Epilepsy Society (<a href="https://www.aesnet.org/meetings_events/annual_meeting_abstracts" title="American Epilepsy Society Web site">https://www.aesnet.org/meetings_events/annual_meeting_abstracts</a>) were searched up to September 2013 for other relevant abstracts. Likewise, the </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Canadian Medical Association Infobase (<a href="https://www.cma.ca/En/Pages/clinical-practice-guidelines.aspx" title="CMA InfoBase Web site">https://www.cma.ca/En/Pages/clinical-practice-guidelines.aspx</a>) </li>
    <li>National Guideline Clearinghouse (<a href="http://www.guideline.gov/" title="NGC Web site" target="_blank">http://www.guideline.gov/</a>) </li>
    <li>And Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (<a href="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/view/0/index.html" title="Cochrane Database Web site">http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/view/0/index.html</a>) </li>
</ul>
<p>were searched up to September 2013 for existing evidence-based practice guidelines. Relevant articles and abstracts were selected and reviewed by two reviewers, and the reference lists from these were searched for additional studies, as were the reference lists from relevant review articles.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Fully published reports or abstracts that met the following criteria were selected for inclusion:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective or retrospective studies that evaluated the use of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in medically intractable epilepsy </li>
    <li>Studies that included &ge;12 patients of any age </li>
    <li>Reported on at least one of the following outcomes: diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], negative predictive value [NPV]), surgical management impact, or patient outcome impact </li>
    <li>Studies that used a suitable reference standard (intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG), surgical eligibility, good surgical outcome [Engel class I, II, or III]) when appropriate </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Studies of non-<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET </li>
    <li>Non-systematic reviews, letters, editorials, individual case reports, historical articles, or commentaries </li>
    <li>Reports published in a language other than English </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literature Search Results</strong></p>
<p>No existing systematic reviews or evidence-based guidelines were found that specifically evaluated the use of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET against a suitable reference standard. In addition, there were no RCTs comparing the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET with intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG). However, 36 retrospective studies and three prospective studies were identified to be relevant to this recommendation report (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). Six of these studies were reported solely in abstract form, while two studies had both the full publication and the abstract. The eligible studies were conducted in various contexts but the Working Group believed the outcomes valued in this report would be relevant to the Regional Epilepsy Surgery Centres of Excellence context.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Synthesizing the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Due to the heterogeneity of the studies in the patient population, study design, outcome measurements, and methods of positron emission tomography (PET) interpretation, the results of the studies included in the systematic review could not be pooled. An assessment of study quality was performed for all fully published reports by one methodologist.</p>
<p><strong>Study Design and Quality</strong></p>
<p>For the fully published reports, study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool (see Appendix II in the original guideline document). Abstracts were not assessed due to limited reporting of study information. The overall quality varied among the studies but the large majority were judged to have low risk of bias. The most common concern was the influence of PET results on the interpretation of the reference standard. That is, localization with intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG), decision to perform surgery, and classification of surgical outcomes were often not blinded to PET findings. Furthermore, some studies excluded patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities (i.e., structural lesions), incomplete tests or short follow-up, lost to follow up, or a definite extratemporal seizure origin.</p>

Potential Benefits

<div class="content_para"><p>The potential benefit of positron emission tomography (PET) in the presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable epilepsy lies in its ability to provide data for localizing the seizure focus and to determine resectability. The evidence from the review proposes that PET is able to provide complementary information that can guide decision making toward successful surgery.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Care has been taken in the preparation of the information contained in this report. Nonetheless, any person seeking to apply or consult the report is expected to use independent medical judgment in the context of individual clinical circumstances or seek out the supervision of a qualified clinician. Cancer Care Ontario makes no representation or guarantees of any kind whatsoever regarding the report content or use or application and disclaims any responsibility for its application or use in any way. </li>
    <li>For localizing epileptic foci or guiding intracranial electrode placement as part of the presurgical evaluation in a Regional Epilepsy Surgery Center of Excellence, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy may benefit more from positron emission tomography (PET) than patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy. </li>
    <li>The evidence is suggestive that localization is greater when PET is assessed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and this method may be superior to visual interpretation for particular types of epilepsy. However, defining the exact group of patients for whom PET is likely to provide enhanced localization information based on SPM is beyond the scope of this report. </li>
    <li>Patients with intractable infantile spasms exhibiting focal metabolic abnormality on PET could be considered for surgery, provided that epileptogenicity of focal malformation is confirmed electrographically during the presurgical evaluation in a Regional Epilepsy Surgery Centre of Excellence. Surgery would not be considered based solely upon a focal area of hypometabolism on PET without other corroborating data. </li>
