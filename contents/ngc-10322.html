<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>In addition to these evidence-based recommendations, the guideline development group also identifies points of best clinical practice in the original guideline document.</em></p>
<p>Classification of evidence levels (<strong>1++ to 4</strong>) and grades of recommendations (<strong>A-D</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preconception Care</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Optimum Preconceptual Care for Women with Thalassaemia?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - At each visit with the thalassaemia team, there should be a discussion and documentation of intentions regarding pregnancy. This should include screening for end-organ damage and optimisation of complications prior to embarking on any pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Any Interventions Which Are Beneficial at the Preconceptual Stage?</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Aggressive chelation in the preconception stage can reduce and optimise body iron burden and reduce end-organ damage.</p>
<p><em>Pancreas</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Women with established diabetes mellitus should ideally have serum fructosamine concentrations &lt;300 nmol/l for at least 3 months prior to conception. This is equivalent to a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 43 mmol/mol.</p>
<p><em>Thyroid</em></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Thyroid function should be determined. The woman should be euthyroid prepregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>What Medications Should be Reviewed Preconceptually?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Iron chelators should be reviewed and deferasirox and deferiprone ideally discontinued 3 months before conception.</p>
<p><strong>What Is the Importance of Genetic Screening and What Procedure(s) Are Involved for Women with Thalassaemia?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - If the partner is a carrier of a haemoglobinopathy that may adversely interact with the woman's genotype then genetic counselling should be offered.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - In vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) with a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) should be considered in the presence of haemoglobinopathies in both partners so that a homozygous or compound heterozygous pregnancy can be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>What Is the Importance of Immunisation and Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Women Who Are at Risk of Transfusion-Related Viral Infections or Have Had a Previous Splenectomy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - All women who have undergone a splenectomy should take penicillin prophylaxis or equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - All women who have undergone a splenectomy should be vaccinated for pneumococcus and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b if this has not been done before.</p>
<p><strong>What Vitamin Supplements Should Be Recommended?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Folic acid (5 mg) is recommended preconceptually to all women to prevent neural tube defects.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Antenatal Care</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Optimum Antenatal Management of Iron Chelation Therapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Management of Women with Myocardial Iron</em></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Women with myocardial iron loading should undergo regular cardiology review with careful monitoring of ejection fraction during the pregnancy as signs of cardiac decompensation are the primary indications for intervention with chelation therapy.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Those women at highest risk of cardiac decompensation should commence low-dose subcutaneous desferrioxamine (20 mg/kg/day) on a minimum of 4 to 5 days a week under joint haematology and cardiology guidance from 20 to 24 weeks of gestation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intrapartum Care</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Best Intrapartum Management for Women with Thalassaemia Major or Intermedia?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Active management of the third stage of labour is recommended to minimise blood loss.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postpartum Care</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Should Be the Optimum Care Post Delivery?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Women with thalassaemia should be considered at high risk for venous thromboembolism.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guidelines. Databases searched included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, EMBASE, TRIP, MEDLINE and PubMed. Search terms included: 'beta thalassaemia', 'Cooley's anaemia', 'Mediterranean anaemia', 'hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism', ovulation induction', 'assisted reproduction', 'iron burden', 'serum ferritin', 'penicillin prophylaxis', 'iron chelation', 'fetal growth and measurement' and 'ultrasonography'. The&nbsp;search was limited to humans and the English language and from 1980 to July 2013. Exclusions were alpha thalassaemia or beta thalassaemia minor. There are no systematic reviews in this area and only small numbers of randomised controlled trials looking at particular interventions. The National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) was also searched for relevant guidelines and reviews. Where possible, recommendations are based on available evidence.&nbsp;Areas lacking evidence were highlighted and annotated as 'good practice points.'</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reviewing and Grading of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Once the evidence has been collated for each clinical question it needs to be appraised and reviewed (refer to section 3 in "Development of RCOG Green-top guidelines: producing a clinical practice guideline" for information on the formulation of the clinical questions; see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). For each question, the study type with least chance of bias should be used. If available, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of suitable size and quality should be used in preference to observational data. This may vary depending on the outcome being examined.</p>
<p>The level of evidence and the grade of the recommendations used in this guideline originate from the guidance by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Grading Review Group, which incorporates formal assessment of the methodological quality, quantity, consistency, and applicability of the evidence base. The methods used to appraise individual study types are available from the SIGN Web site (<a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/checklists.html" title="SIGN Web site">www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/checklists.html </a>). An objective appraisal of study quality is essential, but paired reviewing by guideline leads may be impractical because of resource constraints.</p>
<p>Once evidence has been collated and appraised, it can be graded. A judgement on the quality of the evidence will be necessary using the grading system (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Where evidence is felt to warrant 'down-grading', for whatever reason, the rationale must be stated. Evidence judged to be of poor quality can be excluded. Any study with a high chance of bias (either 1&ndash; or 2&ndash;) will be excluded from the guideline and recommendations will not be based on this evidence. This prevents recommendations being based on poor-quality RCTs when higher-quality observational evidence is available.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Development</strong></p>
<p>The development of guidelines involves more than the collation and reviewing of evidence. Even with high-quality data from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, a value judgement is needed when comparing one therapy with another. This will therefore introduce the need for consensus.</p>
<p>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guidelines are drafted by nominated developers, in contrast to other guideline groups such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), who use larger guideline development groups. Equally, in contrast to other guideline groups, the topics chosen for development as Green-top Guidelines are concise enough to allow development by a smaller group of individuals.</p>
<p>In agreeing the precise wording of evidence-based guideline recommendations and in developing consensus-based 'good practice points', the Guidelines Committee will employ an informal consensus approach through group discussion. In line with current methodologies, the entire development process will follow strict guidance and be both transparent and robust. The RCOG acknowledges that formal consensus methods have been described but these require further evaluation in the context of clinical guideline development. It is envisaged that this will not detract from the rigor of the process but prevent undue delays in development.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Fertility may be reduced in transfusion-dependent individuals where chelation has been suboptimal and iron overload has occurred resulting in damage to the anterior pituitary. </li>
    <li>Due to lack of safety data, all chelation therapy should be regarded as potentially teratogenic in the first trimester. Desferrioxamine is the only chelation agent with a body of evidence for use in the second and third trimester but should be avoided in the first trimester owing to lack of safety data. The optimisation of iron burden is therefore critical as the ongoing iron accumulation from transfusion in the absence of chelation may expose the pregnant woman to a high risk of new complications related to iron overload, particularly diabetes and cardiomyopathy. </li>
    <li>Women who are transfused regularly or intermittently are at risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. It is therefore important to ascertain infectivity and manage the common transfusion related viral infections appropriately. </li>
    <li>Women with thalassaemia major and myocardial iron loading with T2* of &lt;10 ms are at high risk of cardiac decompensation which may present as increasing breathlessness, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, orthopnoea, syncope, palpitations or peripheral oedema. Presentation in the first trimester is associated with adverse clinical outcome. </li>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)&nbsp;produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice. They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration by obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available within the appropriate health services. This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken. </li>
    <li>These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research might be indicated. </li>
