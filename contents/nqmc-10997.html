<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the mean scores on both the subjective importance (SI) and the perceived reality (PR) scales for the "Identity-Oriented Approach" dimension on the Quality from the Patient's Perspective Instrument Specific to Palliative Care (QPP-PC). </p>
<p>The QPP-PC Instrument consists of 52 items including 4 dimensions with 12 factors (49 items) and 3 single items.</p>
<p>Patients answered each item in two ways. First, patients scored their opinions of the quality of actual care received, PR, related to the sentence "<em>This is what I experience</em>&hellip;" (e.g., personnel are respectful to me). Then patients scored the SI of care aspects, related to the sentence "<em>This is how important this is to me</em>&hellip;" (e.g., personnel are respectful to me). A four-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 4 (fully agree), was used for PR, and for SI from 1 (of little or no importance) to 4 (of the very highest importance). A non-applicable alternative was available for both responses.</p>
<p>The "Identity-Oriented Approach" dimension includes the following four factors (20 items):</p>
<p><strong>Information</strong></p>
<p>I receive useful information on: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>How care and treatments will take place </li>
    <li>The effects and use of medicine </li>
    <li>My illness and my symptoms </li>
    <li>What I may expect in the near future (development of the illness and symptoms, my health and function) </li>
    <li>How to take care of myself </li>
    <li>Which doctors are responsible for my medical care </li>
    <li>Which nurses are responsible for my nursing care </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Honesty </strong></p>
<p>The personnel seem to give me honest answers to my questions: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Doctors </li>
    <li>Nurses </li>
    <li>Other personnel </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Respect and Empathy</strong></p>

Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The need to have knowledge and evaluate the quality of palliative care is recognized both internationally and in Norway (Ministry of Health and Care Services, 2015; Grande, 2009; World Health Organization [WHO], 2004). Patients' perceptions of their care may be seen as one aspect of quality of care (Donabedian, 1980; WHO, 2006) and is considered important for development and improvement of palliative care (Grande, 2009; WHO, 2004; WHO, 2006; Singer, Martin, &amp; Kelner, 1999; Ministry of Health and Care Services, "Future care," 2013; Ministry of Health and Care Services, "High quality," 2013). To gain such knowledge, validated instruments are needed, which should be tested in different settings and on patients with different illnesses (Mularski et al., 2007; Unroe &amp; Meier, 2013). </p>
<p>The advantage of using existing instruments to measure patients' perspectives of palliative care quality is that they have been developed within a palliative care context, including patients' views in the development process. The importance of instruments with a foundation of a theoretical model of care quality that is based on patients' perspectives and conceptions of the area can be found in the literature (van Campen et al., 1995), and ensures the measurement of all important aspects of care quality from the patients' perspectives. However, there is a lack of instruments explicitly founded on a theoretical model of care quality from patients' perspectives. </p>
<p>The Quality from the Patient's Perspective Instrument Specific to Palliative Care (QPP-PC) is based on a theoretical model of quality of care, and has its roots in patients' perspectives; this gives patients undergoing palliative care a voice when measuring and evaluating the quality of care. The advantage of the QPP-PC is that the instrument includes measures of both subjective importance and perceived reality of care. This is particularly valuable for guiding the improvement of palliative care at all levels.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>One way of assessing whether the Quality from the Patient's Perspective Instrument Specific to Palliative Care (QPP-PC) is a reliable and valid instrument is to measure the QPP-PC according to the criteria stated by van Campen et al. (1995): instruments should (1) be based on a theoretical foundation, (2) contain a subscale representing different aspects of quality of care, (3) be tested for reliability and validity, and (4) be feasible in large populations. In the developers' opinion, the QPP-PC meets these criteria.</p>
<p>The items in the QPP-PC still reflect all four dimensions of the theoretical model of quality of care derived from patients' perspectives, on which the Quality from the Patient's Perspective Instrument (QPP) is based. Sitzia (1999) elaborated on the validity assessment of instruments by stating that studies should provide results for content validity comprising strategies for item generation and content testing. Items in the QPP-PC were developed based on the perspective of patients receiving palliative care, ensuring that the items developed are perceived as relevant for these patients. The pilot test showed good face and content validity; this was supported by high patients' scores on the subjective importance (SI) scale for each dimension, factor and single item (see Table 4 in the original measure documentation), which was also the case at the level of the items (not reported). Consequently, this supported the content validity of the instrument (Stizia, 1999).</p>
<p>The construct validity (Sitzia, 1999) was evaluated by performing an explorative factor analysis using principal component analysis (PCA), which showed a stable 12-factor solution for the SI and perceived reality (PR) scales, with most items correlating strongly with the factors. Compared with the original QPP, three new factors appeared: "Exhaustion," "Continuity" and "Planning and Cooperation." Although "Exhaustion" appeared as a new factor, this aspect of care has been present as items in the Medical-Technical Competence (MT) dimension of the previous QPP instrument (personal communications with the author Wilde-Larsson). Previous research supports continuity, and planning and cooperation are important for patients who receive palliative care (Sandsdalen et al., 2015; Heyland et al., "Defining priorities," 2010; Murray et al., 2002) and should be included in measures in palliative care (Mularski et al., 2007). Compared to existing instruments measuring palliative care quality from patients' perspectives (Miyashita et al., 2014; Lo et al., 2009; Heyland et al., "The development and validation," 2010; Engelberg et al., 2010; Sulmasy et al., 2002). QPP-PC consists of similar aspects of care. However, to the developers' knowledge, previous instruments do not cover all these aspects of care in one single instrument. </p>
<p>Two items correlated with factors that differed from the original version of the QPP. The item about waiting times was previously described as a factor belonging to the MT dimension; however, in this study this item correlated with items in the factor "Access to Help, Food and Equipment," placed in the Physical-Technical Conditions (PT) dimension. The item about individualized care was previously described as a factor belonging to "Routines." In this study, this item correlated with items in the factor "Continuity." By developing new items and testing these in a new context, new constructs of items may appear that could partly explain the differences experienced in this study. With regard to continuity, it is reasonable to think that receiving help from the same doctors and nurses influences individualized care, and these items may therefore be expected to correlate. These findings need to be supported by further studies; the developers suggest that further validation of the instrument be obtained by confirmatory factor analysis. </p>
<p>Reliability (Sitzia, 1999) was assessed by Cronbach's &alpha;, and values were greater than 0.7 for most factors and dimensions on both the PR and the SI scales, indicating good internal consistency ("Exploratory factor analysis," 2014). This is in line with previous studies using the QPP in other contexts (Holter et al., 2014). However, the factor "Access to Help, Food and Equipment," in the PT dimension, and the factor "Continuity" showed &alpha; values less than 0.7. This &alpha; value for the PT dimension is in line with previous studies using the QPP in the context of hospital care (Wilde Larsson &amp; Larsson, 2002; Gr&oslash;ndahl et al., 2011). The &alpha; values are sensitive to the number of items, and low numbers may lead to low &alpha; values, which could possibly explain the results (Field, 2013). The factors "Spiritual and Existential" and "Meaningfulness" gained high &alpha; levels, which may be explained by the items within both of these factors being the same questions asked by different healthcare personnel.</p></div>

Patients' subjective importance (SI) and perceived reality (PR) responses to items in the "Identity-Oriented Approach" dimension</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients answered each item in two ways. First, patients scored their opinions of the quality of actual care received, PR, related to the sentence "<em>This is what I experience</em>&hellip;" (e.g., personnel are respectful to me). Then patients scored the SI of care aspects, related to the sentence "<em>This is how important this is to me</em>&hellip;" (e.g., personnel are respectful to me). A four-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 4 (fully agree), was used for PR, and for SI from 1 (of little or no importance) to 4 (of the very highest importance). A non-applicable alternative was available for both responses. </li>
    <li>Since the Quality from the Patient's Perspective Instrument Specific to Palliative Care (QPP-PC) was developed to measure the care quality in a number of different settings and for patients with several different illnesses, "not applicable" responses will always be present. For the QPP-PC dimensions and factors, a mean value is calculated based on the individual participant's response to the remaining items in the respective dimension or factor. When participants respond "not applicable" to an item, a mean of the remaining responses in the respective variable substitutes the "not applicable" response. Since the "not applicable" response is coded together with missing observations, any missing observation is also substituted by a mean of the remaining responses in the respective variable. </li>
