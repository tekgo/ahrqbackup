Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 to 75 years of age who had a diagnosis of ischemic vascular disease (IVD) and whose IVD was optimally managed during the measurement period as defined by achieving ALL of the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg </li>
    <li>On statin medication, unless allowed contraindications or exceptions are present </li>
    <li>Non-tobacco user </li>
    <li>On daily aspirin or anti-platelet medication, unless allowed contraindications or exceptions are present </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>According to the Minnesota Department of Health, vascular disease is a high impact clinical condition in Minnesota. More than 20% of all deaths in Minnesota are due to heart disease and more than 7% are due to stroke, making them the second and third leading causes of death, respectively, in the state behind cancer. Inpatient hospitalization charges alone in Minnesota were $1.7 billion for heart disease patients and $318 million for stroke patients in 2007. According to the American Heart Association, nearly 84 million Americans have cardiovascular disease. In every year since 1900 (except the 1918 influenza pandemic), cardiovascular disease accounted for more deaths than any other major cause of death in the United States. In 2006, cardiovascular disease claimed one of every 2.9 deaths in the United States.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>MN Community Measurement (MNCM) conducts validity testing to determine if quality measures truly measure what they are designed to measure, and conducts reliability testing to determine if measures yield stable, consistent results. Validity testing is done to see if the concept behind the measure reflects the quality of care that is provided to a patient and if the measure, as specified, accurately assesses the intended quality concept. Reliability testing is done to see if calculated performance scores are reproducible.</p></div>
