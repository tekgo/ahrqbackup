Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with non-specific low back pain diagnosis who have had collaborative decision-making with regards to referral to a specialist.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the use of collaborative decision-making to allow patients to make more informed decisions about their care. Focus on shared decisions related to imaging, interventions and surgery for radicular pain diagnosis.</p>
<p>Of the 354 million patient visits per year for acute care in the United States only 42% are seen by primary care providers: 28% are seen in the emergency room and 20% are seen by specialists. Visits to primary care clinicians for low back pain are equally split between chiropractors and allopathic clinicians, with low back pain as the fifth most common reason for an office visit to all clinicians. The majority of these visits are not because of pain but rather due to the disability associated with the low back symptoms.</p>
<p>It is estimated that only 15% of all low back pain has an identifiable anatomic explanation. The other 85% is identified as non-specific low back pain. The concept that most low back pain is related to a specific injury is challenged by the recent work of multiple authors showing a limited relationship between low back pain and physical exposures. The discussion of the pathophysiology indicates that it is a multifactorial symptom, which may start with an injury reaction but is exacerbated by concomitant factors that may extend symptoms far past the normal healing time for injured tissues. Co-factors that contribute to persistent pain may include deconditioning, psychological issues, other chronic illnesses, genetics and even culture.</p>
<p>Though it occurs in a small percentage of those with acute or subacute low back pain, the decision to have low back surgery is key to the patient's quality of life. Though surgery for radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation is generally successful, the current clinician/surgeon-centric approach to the recommendation of and decision to have surgery is currently under intense discussion. The Dartmouth Atlas shows large variation in surgical rates. Patients expect and want to be more involved in decisions about their health care. While clinicians routinely attempt to include patient input in decisions, it has been suggested that in some decisions there is a mismatch between the patient's preferences and the clinician's understanding of the preferences. There is also evidence that suggests there is a mismatch between primary care and specialist expectations. There is now a variety of resources that can help facilitate a high-quality decision. The expected benefit is that of higher patient satisfaction with the quality of the decision made.</p>
<p>Shared decision-making has been defined as an integrative process between patient and clinician that engages the patient in decision-making, provides the patient with information about alternatives, and facilitates the incorporation of patient preferences and values into the medical plan. Shared decision-making is the process by which a health care clinician communicates to the patient personalized information about available treatment options, their outcomes and potential benefits and harms. The patient communicates his or her values and the relative importance he or she places on benefits and harms. With this sharing of information, the clinician and patient have a better basis for communication, and the result is a high-quality decision with better patient investment.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The majority of individuals with an episode of acute low back pain improve and return to work within the first two weeks. The probability of recurrence within the first year ranges from 30% to 60%. Most of these recurrences will recover in much the same pattern as the initial event. In as many as one-third of the cases, the initial episode of low back pain persists for the next year. Most of these individuals continue to function with only limited impairment. </li>
    <li>Most of the total cost for low back pain is dedicated to the small percentage of sufferers whose condition has progressed to the chronic disabling stage (pain for more than 12 weeks). The medical costs for low back pain in general were estimated at $26.3 billion in 1998 and now are one-third to one-fourth of the total cost of care. Lost production and disability account for other costs. Disability alone claims 80% of the total expense of this condition. Expenditures for medical care and disability continue to increase. The human cost is equally significant; low back pain is currently the second most common cause of disability in the United States and is the most common cause of disability in those under age 45. </li>
    <li>Approximately two-thirds of the people who recover from a first episode of acute low back symptoms will have another episode within 12 months. </li>
    <li>Low back pain, alone or in combination with pelvic pain, is a common problem suffered by women during pregnancy. Studies estimate 50% to 80% of women will suffer from low back pain during pregnancy, and one study found that approximately 62% of pregnant women suffering from low back pain rated it as moderately severe. Despite the significance of this problem, only one-third of pregnant women reported low back pain to their prenatal care providers. </li>
