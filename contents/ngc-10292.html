Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence assessment (<strong>I-III</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>A-E, L</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outcomes Associated with Untreated Infertility</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>There is increasing evidence that infertility or subfertility is an independent risk factor for obstetrical complications and adverse perinatal outcomes, even without the addition of assisted human reproduction (AHR). (<strong>II-2</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outcomes Associated with Male Factor Infertility</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>All men with severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia (sperm count &lt;5 million/hpf) should be offered genetic/clinical counselling, karyotype assessment for chromosomal abnormalities, and Y-chromosome microdeletion testing prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF) with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>All men with unexplained obstructive azoospermia should be offered genetic/clinical counseling and genetic testing for cystic fibrosis prior to IVF with ICSI. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Obstetrical, Perinatal, and Long-Term Outcomes Associated with Assisted Reproductive Technology</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Multiple Pregnancy and Adverse Obstetrical and Perinatal Outcomes</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>Multiple pregnancy is the most powerful predictive factor for adverse maternal, obstetrical, and perinatal outcomes. Couples should be thoroughly counselled about the significant risks of multiple pregnancies associated with all assisted human reproductive treatments. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>The benefits and cumulative pregnancy rates of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) support a policy of using this protocol in couples with good prognosis for success, and eSET should be strongly encouraged in this population. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>To reduce the incidence of multiple pregnancy, health care policies that support public funding for AHR, with regulations promoting best practice regarding eSET, should be strongly encouraged. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Singleton Pregnancies and Perinatal Outcome/Preterm Birth/Low Birth Weight</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li>Among singleton pregnancies, assisted reproductive technology (ART) is associated with increased risks of preterm birth and low birth weight infants, and ovulation induction (OI) is associated with an increased risk of low birth weight infants. Until sufficient research has clarified the independent roles of infertility and treatment for infertility, couples should be counselled about the risks associated with treatment. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) There is a role for closer obstetric surveillance for women who conceive with AHR. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is growing evidence that pregnancy outcomes are better for cryopreserved embryos fertilized in vitro than for fresh embryo transfers. This finding supports a policy of eSET for women with a good prognosis (with subsequent use of cryopreserved embryos as necessary), and may reassure women who are considering IVF. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women and couples considering AHR and concerned about perinatal outcomes in singleton pregnancies should be advised that (1) ICSI does not appear to confer increased adverse perinatal or maternal risk over standard IVF, and (2) the use of donor oocytes increases successful pregnancy rates in selected women, but even when accounting for maternal age, can increase the risk of low birth weight and preeclampsia. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fetal Structural, Chromosomal, and Imprinting Abnormalities Associated with Assisted Human Reproduction</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Structural Abnormalities (Malformations, Deformations, and Disruptions)</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="9">
    <li>Any ART procedure should be prefaced by a discussion of fetal outcomes and the slight increase in the risk of congenital structural abnormalities, with emphasis on known confounding factors such as infertility and body mass index. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>In pregnancies achieved by ART, routine anatomic ultrasound for congenital structural abnormalities is recommended between 18 and 22 weeks. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Chromosomal Disorders</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="11">
    <li>Pregnancies conceived by ISCI may be at increased risk of chromosomal aberrations, including sex chromosome abnormalities. Diagnostic testing should be offered after appropriate counselling. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Imprinting Disorders</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li>The relative risk for an imprinting phenotype such as Silver-Russell syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, or Angelman syndrome is increased in the assisted reproduction population, but the actual risk for one of these phenotypes to occur in an assisted pregnancy is estimated to be low, at less than 1 in 5000. The exact biological etiology for this imprinting risk increase is likely heterogeneous and requires more research. (<strong>II-2</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="12">
    <li>The possible increased risk for late onset cancer due to gene dysregulation for tumour suppression requires more long-term follow-up before the true risk can be determined. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Preimplantation Genetic Screening</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="13">
    <li>The clinical application of preimplantation genetic testing in fertile couples must balance the benefits of avoiding disease transmission with the medical risks and financial burden of IVF. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Preimplantation screening for aneuploidy is associated with inconsistent findings for improving pregnancy outcomes. Any discussion of preimplantation genetic screening with patients should clarify that there is no adequate information on the long-term effect of embryo single cell biopsy. (<strong>I-C</strong>) </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Published literature was retrieved through searches of Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for English-language articles related to assisted reproduction and perinatal outcomes published from January 2005 to December 2012 (overlapping with the previous Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada guideline) using appropriate controlled vocabulary and key words (assisted reproduction, assisted reproductive technology, ovulation induction, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, embryo transfer, and in vitro fertilization). Results were not restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies; studies of all designs published in English from January 2005 to December 2012 were reviewed, and additional publications were identified from the bibliographies of these articles. Well-conducted randomized controlled trials were considered evidence of the highest quality, followed by cohort studies. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to August 2013. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.</p></div>
