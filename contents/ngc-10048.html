<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from Council on Chiropractic Practice (CCP)</em></strong>: This document contains the changes, additions and revisions to the 2013 Council on Chiropractic Practice Clinical Guideline Number 4. Subluxation Chiropractic Practice and is organized in the following manner: If changes to a Recommendation have been made, these are listed and discussed. If additional literature on the topic was found and reviewed, then these references are listed (see the "References Supporting the Recommendations" field). If a Recommendation was added that was not included in the 2008 Guidelines, this is noted. If a Recommendation remains as it did in the 2008 guidelines a simple statement that the Recommendation remains "unchanged" follows that section/topic.</p>
<p>The most significant change to the guidelines in 2013 is the change to the definition of subluxation: "Subluxation is a neurological imbalance or distortion in the body associated with adverse physiological responses and/or structural changes, which may become persistent and progressive. The most frequent site for the chiropractic correction of subluxation is via the vertebral column."</p>
<p>Definitions of the ratings and categories of evidence are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>

In this regard, it is considered inappropriate to render an opinion regarding the appropriateness of chiropractic care without a chiropractic assessment, including a physical examination of the patient by a licensed chiropractor. When management of patient care is carried out in the collaborative setting, the chiropractor as a primary contact health care provider is the only professional qualified to determine the appropriateness of chiropractic care. The unique role of the chiropractor is separate from other health disciplines (Leach, 1986; Palmer, 1910; Palmer, 1920; Jamison, 1989; Janse, 1979; Ressel, 1986; Schneier &amp; Burns, 1991; Vear, 1974; Webster, 1989; Sawyer, Bergmann, &amp; Good, 1988; "Seventh report to the president &amp; Congress on the status of health personnel," 1990), and should be clarified for both the patient and other practitioners. The patient assessment, specific to the technique practiced by the chiropractor (Souza, 1994; McCarthy, 1994; Deyo, Rainville, &amp; Kent, 1992; Walsh, 1998; van den Hoogen et al., 1995; Potter &amp; Rothstein, 1985; Maigne, Aivaliklis, &amp; Pfefer, 1996; Cote et al., 1996; Terrett, 1996; Wheeler, 1998; Barge, "Diagnosis--is there a middle ground," 1998; Barge, "Diagnosis and responsible doctoring," 1998; McMillin, 1998; Caputo, Cusimano, &amp; Steiman, 1997; Injeyan, Gotlib, &amp; Crawford, 1997), should minimally include a biomechanical and neurophysiological component. It is inappropriate to make a retrospective determination of the clinical need for care rendered prior to the assessment.</td>

                <li>Based on the variety of assessments utilized in the chiropractic profession, the quantity of indicators may vary, thus affecting the periodicity of their appearance and disappearance, which is tantamount to correction of subluxation. </li>
                <li>Subluxation, not being a singular episodic event such as a strain or sprain, may be corrected but reappear, which necessitates careful monitoring and results in a wide variation in the number of adjustments required to affect a longer-term correction. </li>
                <li>Based on the integrity of the spine in terms of degree and extent of degeneration, the frequency of assessments, and the necessity for corrective adjustments, may vary considerably. </li>
                <li>Because the duration of care is being considered relative to the correction of subluxation, it is independent of clinical manifestations of specific dysfunctions, diseases, or syndromes.

All members of the guidelines committee searched the databases using a list of keywords. In particular, literature applicable to the headings within the guidelines such as pediatric chiropractic, pregnancy and chiropractic, etc., was sought. Chiropractic and the nervous system literature was a focus for this update. Search terms included chiropractic pediatrics, chiropractic and pregnancy, chiropractic and nervous system, sensory afferents and chiropractic, chiropractic x-rays, chiropractic and wellness, brain function and chiropractic and chiropractic case studies.</p>
<p>Relevant articles were added to a Google Docs file. This file was then used by students of a chiropractic college to pull the article, photocopy it or download it into a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. The PDF files were then uploaded to Google Docs at which point they were organized into the chapter subheadings of the guidelines. The articles were read, reviewed and assessed for relevance for the update.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The 4th Edition of Clinical Practice Guidelines "Subluxation Chiropractic Practice" Guidelines were developed by the&nbsp;Council on Chiropractic Practice (CCP) Workgroup between January 2012 and September 2013.</p>
<p>Similar to the 2003 and 2008 review, the 2013 review process was a literature search review to update sections with current research and the development of a new definition of subluxation to reflect the current research.</p>
<p>The CCP has developed practice guidelines for subluxation with the active participation of field doctors, consultants, seminar leaders, and technique experts. In addition, the Council has utilized the services of interdisciplinary experts in the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), guidelines development, research design, literature review, law, clinical assessment, chiropractic education, and clinical chiropractic.</p>
<p>The Council additionally included consumer representatives at every stage of the process and had individuals participating from several major chiropractic political and research organizations, chiropractic colleges and several other major peer groups.</p></div>

Cost Analysis

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Cost-effectiveness of Chiropractic Services</strong></p>
<p>Studies suggest that chiropractic, when implemented broadly, would result in significant savings of health care dollars. Substantial health benefits and cost savings to the employer are documented when chiropractic benefits are added to the employee benefits package.</p>
<p>One of the earliest and best estimates of the potential savings with chiropractic comes from a 1996 study by Stano and Smith. Their study compares health insurance payments and patient utilization patterns for episodes of care for common lumbar and low back conditions treated by chiropractic vs. medical providers. Using 2 years of insurance claims data, this study examines 6,183 patients who had episodes with medical or chiropractic first-contact providers. Multiple regression analysis, to control for differences in patient, clinical, and insurance characteristics, indicates that total insurance payments were substantially greater for episodes with a medical first-contact provider. The mean total payment when doctors of chiropractic (DC) were the first providers was $518, whereas the mean payment for cases in which a medical doctor (MD) was the first provider was $1,020 (i.e., almost a 50% cost savings when chiropractors are part of the health team).</p>
<p>Several years later, a ground breaking randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluated the financial impact of provider assignment in the management of neck pain. Patients who saw general practitioners for neck pain were randomly allocated to manual therapy (spinal mobilization), physiotherapy (mainly exercise) or general practitioner care (counseling, education and drugs). Throughout this 52-week study, patients rated their perceived recovery, intensity of pain and functional disability. Manual therapy proved to be the most effective treatment for neck pain. The clinical outcome measures showed that manual therapy resulted in faster recovery than physiotherapy and general practitioner care. While achieving this superior outcome, the total costs of the manual therapy-treated patients were about one-third the cost of physiotherapy or general practitioner (MD) care.</p>
<p>Refer to the original guideline document for additional information of the growing literature supporting the cost-effectiveness of chiropractic across the various third-party payers in the United States (Medicare, State Workman's Compensation, Private insurance) and Internationally.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Following the development of the guidelines and the construction of a draft of the final recommendations, the guidelines were reviewed by over 100 peer reviewers. These reviewers were chosen based on several characteristics (see Table 3 in the original guideline document for more information).</p>
<p>The final draft of the guidelines revision was placed in a secure on line Forum where reviewers were required to provide a LOGON and PASSWORD to enter and access the draft. Once the individual reviewed the draft they then filled out an on line form with any recommendations or changes. Their response was immediately routed to the Project Manager for review and any needed action. Recommendations for additions or changes to the draft based on this review were then circulated electronically to the Panel for feedback. Other than an Assistant to the Project Manager no individual received remuneration for work performed on behalf of the Council to develop these guidelines.</p></div>

    <li>The purpose of these guidelines is to provide the doctor of chiropractic with a "user friendly" compendium of recommendations based upon the best available evidence. It is designed to facilitate, not replace, clinical judgment. </li>
    <li>The most compelling reason for creating, disseminating, and utilizing clinical practice guidelines is to improve the quality of health care. The recommendations made in this guideline are specific to the clinical entity of subluxation and are applicable to the stated goals of the guideline. The recommendations are meant to be flexible based upon each patient encounter and the goals of both the practitioner and the patient being cared for. </li>
    <li>These guidelines are for informational purposes. Utilization of these guidelines is voluntary. They are not intended to replace the clinical judgment of the chiropractor. It is acknowledged that alternative practices are possible and may be preferable under certain clinical conditions. The appropriateness of a given procedure must be determined by the judgment of the practitioner and the needs and preferences of the individual patient. </li>
    <li>It is not the purpose or intent of these guidelines to provide legal advice, or to supplant any statutes, rules, and regulations of a government body having jurisdiction over the practice of chiropractic. </li>
    <li>These guidelines address subluxation chiropractic practice, and do not purport to include all procedures which are permitted by law in the practice of chiropractic. Lack of inclusion of a procedure in these guidelines does not necessarily mean that the procedure is inappropriate for use in the practice of chiropractic. </li>
    <li>Participation in the guidelines development process does not necessarily imply agreement with the final product.
