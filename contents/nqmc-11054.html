Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess percentage of patients, regardless of age, with a diagnosis of prostate cancer at low (or very low) risk of recurrence receiving interstitial prostate brachytherapy, OR external beam radiotherapy to the prostate, OR radical prostatectomy, OR cryotherapy who did not have a bone scan performed at any time since diagnosis of prostate cancer.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: A higher score indicates appropriate treatment of patients with prostate cancer at low (or very low) risk of recurrence.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A bone scan is generally not required for staging prostate cancer in men with a low (or very low) risk of recurrence and receiving primary therapy. This measure is written as a negative measure so that the performance goal is 100%, consistent with the other measures for this condition. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statement</strong> </p>
<p>Routine use of a bone scan is not required for staging asymptomatic men with clinically localized prostate cancer when their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is equal to or less than 20.0 ng/mL (American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc., 2013). </p>
<p>For symptomatic patients and/or those with a life expectancy of greater than 5 years, a bone scan is appropriate for patients with any of the following: 1) T1 disease with PSA over 20 ng/mL or T2 disease with PSA over 10 ng/mL; 2) a Gleason score of 8 or higher; 3) T3 to T4 tumors; or 4) symptomatic disease (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2015).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a measure testing project in 2011 with the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and American Urological Association (AUA), to ensure one Prostate Cancer measure was reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator and exception case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing chart, claims, and electronic health record (EHR) data. Inter-rater reliability was tested. Five sites participated in the testing of the measures. Two sites were in suburban settings, two sites were in urban settings, and one had multiple practice sites in urban, rural and suburban settings. Site A was a hospital-based practice with 21 physicians. Site B was a physician-owned private practice with four physicians. Site C was a physician-owned private practice with 41 physicians. Site D was an academic practice with nine physicians. Site E was an academic practice with 14 physicians.</p>
<p><strong>Measure Tested</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Prostate Cancer: Avoidance of Overuse Measure &ndash; Isotope Bone Scan for Staging Low-Risk Patients </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from chart records were used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the measures. </p>
<p><em>Reliability Testing Results</em></p>
<p>There were 94 observations from five sites used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide-by-zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used. </p>
<p>Of the 94 observations that were initially selected, 94 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide-by-zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used.</p>
<p><em>Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval)</em></p>
<p>Overall Reliability: 94, 100%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)* <br />
Denominator: 94, 100.00%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)* <br />
Numerator: 94, 100.00%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)* <br />
Exception: 94, 100.00%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)* </p>
<p>This measure demonstrates perfect reliability, as shown in results from the above analysis. </p>
<p class="Note">*Cannot calculate kappa statistics when only one response (Yes/Yes) was used, as this causes a divide-by-zero error in the statistic formula.</p></div>
