<p>A suspicion that a patient is affected by Fabry disease is usually based on a targeted patient medical history and a detailed family history. High yield clinical and family history features are summarized in the table below. Although Fabry disease is considered highly penetrant in males and females, it can be variable in its expression.</p>

</table>
<p>Diagnosis of Fabry disease is confirmed using a combination of biochemical and molecular testing (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Fabry disease can be confirmed in males with deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (&alpha;-gal A), most commonly measured in blood (leukocytes), and the presence of a disease causing mutation in the <em>GLA</em> gene located on Xq22.1. Although in the past low &alpha;-gal A activity has been considered sufficient for diagnosis in males, the presence of a common pseudodeficiency allele, D313Y, that results in low plasma &alpha;-gal A activity and slightly reduced leukocyte enzyme activity suggests that a diagnosis of Fabry disease should not be finalized until a disease causing <em>GLA</em> mutation is identified. </li>
    <li>Measurement of &alpha;-gal A enzyme activity is not reliable for diagnosis of Fabry in females because obligate heterozygotes have variable levels of &alpha;-gal A that can overlap with enzyme levels found in healthy controls. In females confirmation of Fabry is via identification of a Fabry disease causing mutation in the <em>GLA</em> gene. </li>
    <li>Biopsies of heart or kidney are not required for diagnosis in this condition, although storage patterns on biopsies may suggest a Fabry disease diagnosis in an affected individual. </li>
</ol>
<p>Prenatal diagnosis of Fabry disease is possible using amniocytes and chorionic villi for enzymatic and molecular testing, although only molecular testing is routinely performed in the United States. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for families with a known familial mutation is also available via assisted reproduction centers.</p>
<p>Newborn screening for Fabry disease is now technically possible and programs have begun in Taiwan, Missouri, Washington State, and Illinois. Other states such as New Mexico and New Jersey also have legislated beginning newborn screening for Fabry and will begin testing in the near future. The methods utilized are designed to limit false positive and negatives, but most are based on enzyme measurement which will predominantly diagnose males and a subset of affected females with low enzyme. Although not currently on the recommended panel of conditions to screen, several state legislatures have mandated screening for Fabry disease. The goals of newborn screening for Fabry disease are to diagnosis patients earlier, avoid the "diagnostic odyssey," monitor and treat patients prior to irreversible damage, and identify family members at-risk to be affected by Fabry disease. Issues surrounding the testing also relate to identification of other affected family members. Newborn screening has begun in selected states, so the issue of pediatric management and timing of initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has expanded.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Follow-up and Intervention by Appropriate Medical Professionals</strong></p>
<p>The progressive nature of Fabry disease requires at least annual evaluation and revision of management based on clinical and lab assessments by the appropriate medical professionals. Guidelines for multidisciplinary management and ERT treatment have been published for both pediatric and adult patients. In short, the following steps are recommended for any individual once a diagnosis of Fabry disease is made:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Referrals by appropriate medical professionals to a metabolic specialist and genetic counselor for discussion of diagnosis, recurrence risk, construction of a detailed family history, identification of other at risk family members, and development of a comprehensive monitoring and treatment plan. Contact information for medical professionals experienced in treating Fabry disease patients can be found by contacting the National Fabry Disease Foundation. </li>
    <li>Baseline evaluations to be ordered by and under the supervision of appropriate medical professionals as recommended for age group include:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Complete blood count (CBC), platelet count, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), globotriaosylceramide (GL3), thyroid studies, common thrombophilic blood coagulation disorders, and a basic metabolic chemistry panel </li>
        <li>Routine urinalysis </li>
        <li>24 h urine with creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and protein clearance </li>
        <li>First morning urine measuring total protein and creatinine levels </li>
        <li>Electrocardiogram (EKG) </li>
        <li>24 h Holter monitor </li>
        <li>Echocardiogram and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </li>
        <li>Brain MRI or head computed tomography (CT) </li>
        <li>Hearing examination </li>
        <li>Ophthalmologic examination </li>
        <li>Pulmonary function testing </li>
        <li>Depression/anxiety assessment </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Discussion with appropriate medical professionals of treatment with ERT. Treatment practices vary widely in recommended timing of beginning ERT. The decision to initiate therapy should be determined based on the clinical judgment of the managing metabolic specialist after reviewing baseline evaluations in conjunction with the patient or patient's family in affected minors. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Genetic Counseling Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Genetic counseling specific recommendations related to issues in Fabry disease encompass a wide range of topics (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Specific points to examine further during sessions include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Ascertaining patients' needs and concerns relating to a Fabry disease diagnosis </li>
    <li>Identifying at-risk family members through construction of a detailed pedigree and diagnostic testing </li>
    <li>Explaining the natural history and inheritance pattern of Fabry disease </li>
    <li>Provision of pre- and post-counseling regarding genetic testing including the issue of non-paternity </li>
    <li>Navigation of personal and family testing (enzyme, sequencing, duplication/deletion testing) </li>
    <li>Discussions related to prenatal testing and decision making, assessing the subjects' psychosocial issues </li>
    <li>Identifying appropriate support resources </li>
</ol>
<p>Key Fabry-specific points to address during these discussion topics include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The X-linked pattern of inheritance for Fabry disease and testing at-risk family members. On average, there are 5 family members diagnosed with Fabry disease for every proband. Discussion should include issues of misattributed paternity which could arise from testing. This disease should be referred to as an X-linked disorder not an "X-linked recessive disorder." </li>
    <li>Clinical manifestations of Fabry disease occur in men and women. Women are not "just carriers." </li>
    <li>Fabry disease is progressive and often becomes symptomatic in childhood. The average presentation age in males is 6&ndash;8 years of age and 9 years of age in females, although age of symptom onset varies from individual to individual even within the same family. Nevertheless, life threatening complications are rare in pediatric patients. </li>
    <li>Types of genetic testing available and test limitations (e.g., enzyme assay can be normal in heterozygous females; the percentage of residual &alpha;-gal A enzyme activity does not correlate with clinical severity; and mutations frequently cannot predict disease severity). </li>
    <li>Issues related to genetic testing for Fabry disease such as testing "healthy" minors and insurance implications. </li>
    <li>Testing kidney donors, particularly family members, prior to transplant for Fabry disease </li>
    <li>Reproductive options including gamete donation, prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation diagnosis. </li>
    <li>Teratogenic risk of frequently used medications in Fabry disease such as Dilantin, carbamazepine (Tegretol), and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in pregnancy </li>
    <li>Issues related to treatment compliance on a life-long infusion therapy including: transition from parent to patient directed medical care as the patient becomes an adult, insurance issues, realistic expectations of treatment efficacy, continued need for concomitant treatments and monitoring, and possible weight gain </li>
    <li>Identify potential substance abuse; pain can be one of the most debilitating features of Fabry disease, and there can be problems with substance abuse as a form of self-medication. </li>
    <li>Identify issues of sexuality. Men and women with Fabry disease may have concerns about body image, intimacy, and sexuality. For example, affected individuals may be embarrassed by angiokeratomas in their genital region. Chronic pain and fatigue and erectile dysfunction may also contribute to difficulties and problems with intimacy. </li>
    <li>Review of management options and prevention, and referral to specialists as appropriate </li>
    <li>Due to years of misdiagnosis, there can be an inherent mistrust of health professionals. </li>
    <li>Discussion of the increased rate of depression, anxiety, and adaptive function disorders (ability to function in daily life and maintain relationships) seen in Fabry disease. </li>
    <li>Discussion of the unique psychosocial issues in relation to Fabry disease. Overall the psychosocial issues in relation to a diagnosis of Fabry disease are similar to those associated with a diagnosis of other chronic genetic disorders (e.g., anxiety, anger, grief, denial, blame, hopelessness, and influence on self-esteem and self-identify, changed relationships with family of origin). The chronic nature of this condition can stress relationships. There is a higher rate of unemployment and suicide. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The practice guidelines of the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) are developed by members of the NSGC to assist genetic counselors and other health care providers in making decisions about appropriate management of genetic concerns, including access to and/or delivery of services. Each practice guideline focuses on a clinical or practice-based issue, and is the result of a review and analysis of current professional literature believed to be reliable. As such, information and recommendations within the NSGC practice guidelines reflect the current scientific and clinical knowledge at the time of publication, are only current as of their publication date, and are subject to change without notice as advances emerge. </li>
    <li>In addition, variations in practice, which take into account the needs of the individual patient and the resources and limitations unique to the institution or type of practice, may warrant approaches, treatments and/or procedures that differ from the recommendations outlined in this guideline. Therefore, these recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. Genetic counseling practice guidelines are never intended to displace a health care provider's best medical judgment based on the clinical circumstances of a particular patient or patient population. Practice guidelines are published by NSGC for educational and informational purposes only, and NSGC does not "approve" or "endorse" any specific methods, practices, or sources of information. </li>
