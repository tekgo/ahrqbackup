Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adolescent and adult patients who initiate treatment through an inpatient alcohol and other drug (AOD) admission, outpatient visit, intensive outpatient service or partial hospitalization within 14 days of the diagnosis.</p>
<p>See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measure <a href="/content.aspx?id=48855" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Engagement of alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment: percentage of patients who initiated treatment and who had two or more additional services with a diagnosis of AOD within 30 days of the initiation visit</a>.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Electronic and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Electronic specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid specification.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There are more deaths, illnesses and disabilities from substance abuse than from any other preventable health condition. Treatment of medical problems caused by substance abuse places a huge burden on the health care system (Schneider Institute for Health Policy &amp; Brandeis University, 2001). </p>
<p>Identifying people with alcohol and other drug (AOD) disorders is an important first step in the process of care, but identification often does not lead to initiation of care (McCorry et al., 2000). Someone may not initiate treatment because of the social stigma associated with AOD disorders, denial of the problem or lack of immediately available treatment services (McCorry et al., 2000). This measure is designed to ensure that treatment is initiated once the need has been identified, and permits comparison of effectiveness in initiating care.</p></div>

Once NCQA establishes national benchmarks for accountable care organization (ACO) performance, all measures will undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomial statistical analysis. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test.</p></div>
