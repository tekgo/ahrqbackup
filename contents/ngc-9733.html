    <li>Advise patients to take a Medical travel document in case they are travelling abroad. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patient and Caregiver Education &ndash; Why, Who, When, Where, How, and What</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Ensure that the healthcare professional is proficient in both the skills and teaching of IC. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>IC should be taught by an appropriately experienced nurse. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Individualise teaching for the patients and their caregivers (Wilde, Brasch, &amp; Zhang, 2011). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>

    <li>Assure that all verbal information is reinforced with written information to help the patient and caregiver learn the procedure. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ongoing Support and Follow-up</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Provide ongoing social support (by consultation/telephone) to improve quality of life (QoL) (Pomfret &amp; Winder, 2007; Winder, 2008; Jaquet et al., 2009) and prevent complications. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Assess adherence in patients by keeping a registration of catheterisation practice, IC cessation, and other relevant aspects. (van Achterberg et al., 2008). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Ongoing support should be available for patients and relatives for the period of the catheterisation. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procedures for Intermittent Catheterisation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations for IC by a Healthcare Professional</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Verbal consent should be obtained from the patient for IC before starting the procedure. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Observe local protocol on procedure for IC. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Observe the protocols for the principles of the aseptic procedures (Gould et al., 2009). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use a sterile catheter to prevent cross contamination in clinical, rehabilitations, and long term care settings. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Check for lidocaine and chlorhexidine intolerance if using a lubricant containing lidocaine and/or chlorhexidine*. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use a sterile single-use packet of lubricant jelly, when inserting a non-coated urethral catheter*. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Install 10 ml of lubricating gel in male, 6 ml in female patients (Bardsley, 2005) when inserting a non-coated urethral catheter*. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Routine use of antiseptic lubricants for inserting the catheter is not necessary*. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Perform IC after micturition if it is indicated in a patient who is able to void*. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use a voiding diary to investigate the fluid intake and output in the patient*. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">The above recommendations with an asterisk (*) should also be included in the patient/caregiver education on intermittent (self) catheterisation.</p>
<p><strong>Meatal Cleansing</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cleaning or disinfection of the meatus urethrae. (<strong>Unresolved issue</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Reassess the choice of material, equipment, catheterisation technique, lubrication, etc. in case of problems. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Increase the traction on the penis slightly and apply a steady, gentle pressure on the catheter if resistance is felt at the external sphincter. Ask the patient to strain gently as if passing urine. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Instruct the non-neurogenic patient to do pelvic floor exercises (relaxing the pelvic floor during insertion and removing) because this may be helpful to reduce pain. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use a slightly larger Charri&egrave;re (Ch) size if there is a small lumen catheter buckle/kink in the urethra. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use a smaller lumen catheter in case of complaints of suction or place the thumb on the catheter during removal to avoid suction. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use a special tip (Tiemann, IQ-Cath<sup>&reg;</sup>, Ergothan) catheter or hold the penis in an upright position to straighten out the curves, if unable to negotiate the catheter past the U-shaped bulbar urethra. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C)</strong> </li>
    <li>When inserting a Tiemann tip, the tip must point upward in the 12 o'clock position to facilitate passage around the prostate gland (Smith, 2003). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Assess the patient's bowel function in case of constipation to prevent pressure on the drainage lumen. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Add additional lubrication and/or gel coated catheters to reduce discomfort in women with mucosal atrophy. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Insert the catheter carefully to reduce the risk of bladder calculus formation caused by pubic hairs in the bladder. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Infection Prevention</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Urinalysis</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Undertake urinalysis or take a specimen of urine for culture if a patient has symptoms suggesting a UTI (Tenke et al., 2008). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fluid Intake</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Encourage patients to drink enough fluid to maintain a urine output of at least 1,200 ml per day (Heard &amp; Buhrer, 2005). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Patients should be given sufficient fluid based on their weight (25-35 ml/kg/day). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cranberries</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Do not recommend cranberry supplementation routinely to prevent or treat UTI (Jepson, Mihaljevic, &amp; Craig, 1998; Jepson &amp; Craig, 2008). (<strong>LE=1b, GR=A</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hand Hygiene</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Observe protocols on hand hygiene before catheterisation (Tenke et al., 2008; Biering-S&oslash;rensen, Bagi, &amp; H&oslash;iby, 2001). (<strong>LE=1b, GR=A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Educate patient/caregiver in techniques of hand hygiene before discharge from hospital. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patient QoL</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Discuss sexuality and impact of IC as a part of patient assessment; if necessary, refer to a psychologist/sexologist. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Documentation</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Complete a voiding diary for all intermittent catheterisation patients to assess bladder emptying. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Offer patients an individualised care plan based on the above criteria, bearing in mind the patient's and caregiver's lifestyles and the impact this will have on the patient's QoL (Getliffe et al., 2007). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intermittent Urethral Dilatation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Materials and Procedure</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Inform the patient and/or caregiver that long-term intermittent urethral dilatation is not curative and will be required long-term unless e.g., reconstructive surgery is planned (Lauritzen et al., 2009). (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Advise the patient and/or caregiver not to continue advancing the catheter if more than minimal force is required. (<strong>LE=4, GR=C</strong>) </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>The information offered in these guidelines was obtained through a systematic literature search and a review of current procedures undertaken in various member countries of the European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN).</p>
<p>PubMed and Embase were searched using both free text and the respective Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and EMTREE thesauri. The time frame covered in the searches was January 2000 to July 2011. If a topic were not covered by the results of the search, earlier references were used. Additional searches about topics such as compliance and quality of life were carried out by the Working Group for the specific chapters.

<p><strong>Limitations of the Search</strong></p>
<p>The search results were not limited to randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews. In all databases, output was limited to human studies, adults aged &ge;19 years, 2000 to July 2011, and publications in English language. Additional searches were not limited to any level of evidence and book chapters were also used.</p>
<p><strong>Search Results</strong></p>
<p>The initial search on catheterisation was done by two experts in the nursing field. See Flowchart 1 and Flowchart 2 in the original guideline document for search results for "Intermittent catheterization" and "Dilatation." It was a policy decision to restrict the search in this way, although the group were aware that more complex strategies were possible, and would be encouraged in the context of a formal systematic review. In the process of working with the articles, new references were found and added to the reference list, if they were relevant to the topic and cited in the text.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Rating System</strong></p>
<p>The recommendations provided in the original guideline documents are based on a rating system modified from that produced by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (OCBM) in 2011. All group members participated in the critical assessment of the scientific papers identified.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, the Guidelines Working Group have graded treatment recommendations using a three-grade recommendation system (A-C) and inserted levels of evidence to help readers assess the validity of the statements made. The aim of this practice is to ensure a clear transparency between the underlying evidence and a recommendation given. This system is further described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Evidence" and the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" fields.</p>
<p>Some of the literature was not easy to grade. However, if the European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) Working Group thought that the information would be useful in practice, it was ranked as level of evidence 4 and grade of recommendation C. Low-level evidence indicates that no higher level evidence was found in the literature when writing the guidelines, but cannot be regarded as an indication of the importance of the topic or recommendation for daily practice.</p>
<p>The literature used in these guidelines included qualitative research, but because there is no systematic ranking for these types of studies, the qualitative studies were all graded level 4.</p>
<p>The recommendations in these guidelines are not based on reviews.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) Guidelines Working Group for intermittent catheters has prepared the original guideline document to help nurses assess the evidence-based management and incorporate the recommendations of the guidelines into their clinical practice. These guidelines are not meant to be prescriptive, nor will adherence to them guarantee a successful outcome in all cases. Ultimately, decisions regarding care must be made on a case-by-case basis by health care professionals after consultation with their patients, using their clinical judgement, evidence-based knowledge, and expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of the Document</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The EAUN acknowledge and accept the limitations of the original guideline document. It should be emphasised that the current guidelines provide information about the treatment of an individual patient according to a standardised approach. The information should be considered as providing recommendations without legal implications. The intended readership is the pan-European practising urology nurse and nurses working in a related field. </li>
    <li>Cost-effectiveness considerations and non-clinical questions are best addressed locally and therefore fall outside the remit of the original guideline document. Other stakeholders, including patient representatives, have not been involved in producing the original guideline document. </li>
