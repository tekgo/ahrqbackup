<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 12 years and older with migraine headache with a treatment plan who report adherence to their treatment plan.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with migraine headache who have a treatment plan or report adherence to a treatment plan for mild, moderate and severe migraine headaches.</p>
<p>Headache is a very common problem presenting to primary care clinicians, with about 3% of emergency department visits and 1.3% of outpatient visits for headaches. While tension-type headache is the most common type of headache overall, migraine is the most common headache type seen in clinical practice, with visits for tension-type headache and cluster headaches being much less common in clinician's offices. Therefore migraine is the first and primary headache type reviewed.</p>
<p>Migraine is a genetically influenced chronic brain condition marked by paroxysmal attacks of moderate to severe throbbing headache. About 324 million persons suffer from migraine worldwide according to the World Health Organization. Nearly 18% of women and 8% of men in the United States suffer from migraine in any given year. Typically the disorder begins in adolescence and young adults but the lifetime cumulative incidence is 43% for women and 18% for men. Over 25% of migraine sufferers have more than three headache days per month.</p>
<p>Because headache is such a common disorder that is often misdiagnosed and undertreated or mistreated, improved diagnosis of headache syndromes will improve the patient's experience of care, notably quality of and satisfaction with care. Morbidity due to headaches is substantial, so improved diagnosis and treatment will improve the health of the population. Reducing office visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient admissions for uncontrolled headache syndromes along with reducing unnecessary tests and procedures for headache diagnosis is likely to reduce total costs of care even if there are more visits for diagnosis of headache and increased costs for headache-specific drugs.</p>
<p>Patient adherence to therapy contributes to reaching treatment goals. The clinician-patient relationship plays a key role in improving adherence. </p></div>
