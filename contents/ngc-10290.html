<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Identification of Patients with Occult Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>In patients with recent cryptogenic stroke, outpatient cardiac rhythm monitoring performed with nonimplanted devices probably detects unsuspected NVAF at a rate that ranges from 0% to 23% (weighted average 10.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.9% to 14.3%]), with longer monitoring periods probably associated with a greater yield. Many of the NVAF episodes that are detected are clinically asymptomatic, and thus monitoring devices with continuous recording or automatic detection algorithms, rather than patient-triggered recording, are preferred. The risk of recurrent stroke is uncertain in patients with very brief (e.g., &lt;30 seconds) or very infrequent episodes of NVAF; however, previous studies have demonstrated that NVAF tends to occur for progressively longer periods, and the stroke risk in patients with paroxysmal NVAF is similar to that in patients with persistent NVAF.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Clinicians might obtain outpatient cardiac rhythm studies in patients with cryptogenic stroke without known NVAF, to identify patients with occult NVAF (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians might obtain cardiac rhythm studies for prolonged periods (e.g., for 1 or more weeks) instead of shorter periods (e.g., 24 hours) in patients with cryptogenic stroke without known NVAF, to increase the yield of identification of patients with occult NVAF (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection of Patients for Antithrombotic Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Within the NVAF population, the absolute risk of ischemic stroke varies widely on the basis of the presence of other stroke risk factors. The absolute stroke risk is highest among patients with NVAF and a history of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (aggregated absolute risk about 10%/y). Although multiple risk stratification tools are available for estimating the absolute stroke risk of patients with NVAF, the absolute stroke risks estimated by these tools vary widely.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to determine with precision the absolute stroke risk in patients with NVAF, determining when the benefit from reduced stroke risk outweighs the harm of increased bleeding is likewise difficult. In these circumstances, patient preferences and physician judgment become especially important.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Clinicians should inform patients with NVAF that these patients have an increased stroke risk and that this risk can potentially be reduced by antithrombotic use. Patients should also be informed that antithrombotic use increases their risk of major bleeding (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should counsel all patients with NVAF that the decision to use antithrombotics must be made only after the potential benefit from the stroke risk reduction has been weighed against the potential harm from the increased risk of major bleeding. Clinicians should also emphasize the important role of judgment and preferences in this decision (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should routinely offer anticoagulation to patients with NVAF and a history of TIA or stroke, to reduce these patients' subsequent risk of ischemic stroke (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians might not offer anticoagulation to patients with NVAF who lack additional risk factors ("lone" NVAF patients). Clinicians might reasonably offer antithrombotic therapy with aspirin to such patients or might not offer antithrombotic therapy at all (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>To inform their judgments as to which patients with NVAF might benefit more from anticoagulation, clinicians should use a risk stratification scheme to help identify patients with NVAF who are at higher risk for stroke or at no clinically significant risk. However, clinicians should not rigidly interpret anticoagulation thresholds suggested by these tools as being definitive indicators of which patients require anticoagulation (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection of a Specific Oral Anticoagulant</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>The guideline panel's review indicates that several anticoagulant medications decrease the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with NVAF. In clinical trials, the new oral anticoagulants are noninferior or superior to warfarin for reducing stroke, and in most patients the reduction in ischemic stroke risk outweighs the risk of bleeding complications.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>To reduce the risk of stroke or subsequent stroke in patients with NVAF judged to require oral anticoagulants, clinicians should choose one of the following options (<strong>Level B</strong>):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Warfarin, target international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0 </li>
        <li>Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (if creatinine clearance [CrCl] &gt;30 mL/min) </li>
        <li>Rivaroxaban 15 mg/d (if CrCl 30 to 49 mL/ min) or 20 mg/d </li>
        <li>Apixaban 5 mg twice daily (if serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL) or 2.5 mg twice daily if <em>any 2</em> of the following criteria are present: serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL and &lt;2.5 mg/dL; body weight &le;60 kg; age &ge;80 years.) </li>
        <li>Triflusal 600 mg plus acenocoumarol, target INR 1.25 to 2.0 (patients at moderate stroke risk, mostly in developing countries) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Patients Already Taking Warfarin</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li>Clinicians might recommend that patients taking warfarin whose condition is well-controlled continue warfarin treatment rather than switch to treatment with a new oral anticoagulant (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Intracranial Bleeding Risk</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>Clinicians should administer dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban to patients who have NVAF requiring anticoagulant medication and are at higher risk of intracranial bleeding (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding Risk</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
    <li>Clinicians might offer apixaban to patients with NVAF and GI bleeding risk who require anticoagulant medication (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Other Factors Affecting Administration of New Oral Anticoagulants</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>Clinicians should offer dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban to patients unwilling or unable to submit to frequent periodic testing of INR levels (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should offer apixaban to patients unsuitable for being treated, or unwilling to be treated, with warfarin (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Where apixaban is unavailable, clinicians might offer dabigatran or rivaroxaban (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Where oral anticoagulants are unavailable, clinicians might offer a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Where triflusal is available and patients are unable or unwilling to take new oral anticoagulants (mostly in developing countries), clinicians should offer acenocoumarol (target INR 1.25 to 2.0) and triflusal to patients with NVAF who are at moderate stroke risk and higher bleeding risk (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Populations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Some clinicians are reluctant to use anticoagulants to treat elderly patients with NVAF because of perceived high risk of bleeding. However, anticoagulation with warfarin is superior to that with aspirin for reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in patients &ge;75 years with NVAF, whereas rates of major bleeding are comparable. In one important subgroup, elderly patients who have frequent falls or advanced dementia, data are insufficient to determine whether anticoagulants are safe or effective. One study that used a decision analysis model estimated that an elderly patient would need to fall 295 times in 1 year to offset the stroke reduction benefits with warfarin.</p>
<p>Another important subgroup is patients with renal failure. For dabigatran, one of the newer anticoagulants, a lower dose of 75 mg bid is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration when the CrCl reaches 15 to 30 mL/min. Apixaban is recommended at 5 mg twice daily, if serum creatinine is &lt;1.5 mg/dL, or at 2.5 mg twice daily, if serum creatinine is &gt;1.5 and &lt;2.5 mg/dL. Rivaroxaban was tested in patients at 15 mg daily, if CrCl is 30 to 49 mL/min, or at 20 mg daily, if CrCl is &gt;50 mL/min, and recommendations are limited to these patient groups. With regard to warfarin, data have shown that warfarin treatment is associated with a decreased risk of stroke or systemic thromboembolism among patients with non&ndash;end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) but that warfarin treatment may be associated with an increased bleeding risk.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Clinicians should routinely offer oral anticoagulants to elderly patients (aged &gt;75 years) with NVAF if there is no history of recent unprovoked bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians might offer oral anticoagulation to patients with NVAF who have dementia or occasional falls. However, clinicians should counsel patients or their families that the risk&ndash;benefit ratio of oral anticoagulants is uncertain in patients with NVAF who have moderate to severe dementia or very frequent falls (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Because the risk&ndash;benefit ratio of oral anticoagulants in patients with NVAF and end-stage renal disease is unknown, there is insufficient evidence for making practice recommendations (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>

<p><em>Class II</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The study is a cohort study meeting criteria a&ndash;c above or is a randomized, controlled trial that lacks one or two criteria a&ndash;d. </li>
    <li>All relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences. </li>
    <li>There is masked or objective outcome assessment. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Class III</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The study is a controlled study (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as their own controls). </li>
    <li>The study includes a description of major confounding differences between treatment groups that could affect outcome. </li>
    <li>Outcome assessment is masked, objective, or performed by someone who is not a member of the treatment team.** </li>

    <li>The study does not include patients with the disease. </li>
    <li>The study does not include patients receiving different interventions. </li>
    <li>The study uses undefined or unaccepted interventions or outcome measures. </li>
    <li>No measures of effectiveness or statistical precision are presented or calculable. </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">*Note that numbers 1-3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class="Note">**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p>
<p><strong>For Questions Related to Screening (Yield)</strong></p>
<p><em>Class I</em></p>
<p>A statistical,<sup>a</sup> population-based<sup>b</sup> sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. All patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective,<sup>c</sup> is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><em>Class II</em></p>
<p>A statistical,<sup>b</sup> non&ndash;referral-clinic-based<sup>d</sup> sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. Most (&gt;80%) patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective,<sup>c</sup> is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations.</p>
<p><em>Class III</em></p>
<p>A sample of patients studied during the course of the condition. Some patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective,<sup>c</sup> is determined in an evaluation by someone other than the treating physician.</p>
<p><em>Class IV</em></p>
<p>The data are derived from expert opinion, case reports, or any study not meeting criteria for Class I to III.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>a</sup>Statistical sample: The study uses a complete (consecutive), random, or systematic (e.g., every third patient) sample of the available population with the disease.</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>b</sup>Population based: The available population for the study consists of all patients within a defined geographic region.</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>c</sup>Objective: The objective consists of an outcome measure that is very unlikely to be affected by an observer's expectations (e.g., determination of death, the presence of a mass on head computed tomography, serum B12 assays).</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>d</sup>Non&ndash;referral-clinic based: The available population for the study consists of all patients presenting to a primary care setting with the condition. For referral-clinic-based studies, the available population consists of all patients referred to a tertiary care or specialty setting. These patients may have been selected for more severe or unusual forms of the condition and thus may be less representative.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The panel engaged a medical librarian to search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science for relevant articles published between 1998 and November 2012. The key text words and index words used in the search are "anticoagulation," "antithrombotics," "antiplatelets," "atrial fibrillation," "cardioembolic stroke," "cryptogenic stroke," and "paroxysmal atrial fibrillation." The guideline developers considered studies that addressed population screening and therapy, including special population groups such as elderly individuals, nursing home residents, people with end-stage renal disease, and people with dementia. Appendix e-3 of the data supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provides the complete search strategy. The search was restricted to peer-reviewed articles on human subjects written in English. A secondary search of references of selected articles was conducted up to March 2013 to identify any articles missed in the initial search.</p>
<p>The searches yielded 2,450 abstracts, each of which was reviewed for relevance by at least 2 panel members. Of those abstracts, 125 were deemed relevant, and the corresponding articles were obtained for full-text review by 2 panelists working independently.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was synthesized and conclusions developed using a modified form of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process. The confidence in evidence was anchored to the studies' risk of bias in accordance with the rules outlined in Appendix e-5 of the data supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The overall confidence in the evidence pertinent to a question could be downgraded by 1 or more levels on the basis of the following factors: consistency, precision, directness, publication bias, or biologic plausibility. In addition, the overall confidence in the evidence pertinent to a question could be downgraded 1 or more levels or upgraded by 1 level on the basis of the following factors: magnitude of effect, dose response relationship, or direction of bias. Two panel members working together completed an evidence summary table to determine the final confidence in the evidence (see Appendix e-6 of the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field] for the evidence synthesis tables). The confidence in the evidence was indicated by use of modal operators in conclusion statements in the manuscript. "Highly likely" or "highly probable" correspond to high confidence level, "likely" or "probable" correspond to moderate confidence level, and "possibly" corresponds to low confidence level. Very low confidence was indicated by the phrase "insufficient evidence."</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The panel formulated a rationale for recommendations based on the evidence systematically reviewed and stipulated axiomatic principles of care. This rationale is explained in a section which precedes each set of recommendations. From this rationale, corresponding actionable recommendations were inferred. The authors assigned a level of obligation to each recommendation using a modified Delphi process to evaluate the following prespecified domains: the confidence in the evidence systematically reviewed, the acceptability of axiomatic principles of care, the strength of indirect evidence, and the relative magnitude of anticipated health benefits to harms. Additional factors explicitly considered by the panel that could modify the level of obligation include judgments with regard to the importance of outcomes, cost of compliance to the recommendation relative to benefit, the availability of the intervention, and anticipated variations in patient preferences. The prespecified rules for determining the final level of obligation from these domains is indicated in Appendix e-7 of the data supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The level of obligation was indicated using standard modal operators. "Must" corresponds to "Level A," very strong recommendations; "should" to "Level B," strong recommendations; and "might" to "Level C," weak recommendations. The panel members' judgments supporting the levels of obligation are indicated in the tables in Appendix e-8 of the data supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<h3>
Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. Must recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>should</em>. <em>Should</em> recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>may</em> or <em>might</em>. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that "must" be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that "should" be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that "might" be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes. </p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A <strong>Level R</strong> designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non&ndash;evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention</li>
