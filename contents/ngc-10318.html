<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis of Ocular Complications of Diabetes Mellitus</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Individuals with Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus</strong></p>
<p><em>Ocular Examination</em></p>
<p>The ocular examination of an individual suspected of having undiagnosed diabetes should include all aspects of a comprehensive eye examination* with supplemental testing, as noted in the original guideline document.</p>
<p class="Note">*Refer to the <a href="http://www.aoa.org/documents/optometrists/CPG-1.pdf" title="American Optometric Association Web site">Optometric Clinical Practice Guideline for Comprehensive Adult Eye and Vision Examination</a>.</p>
<p>Persons without a diagnosis of diabetes who present with signs suggestive of diabetes during the initial examination should be referred to their primary care physician for evaluation, or an A1C test or fasting blood glucose analysis may be ordered.</p>
<p><strong>Individuals with Diagnosed Diabetes Mellitus</strong></p>
<p>The ocular examination of a person with diabetes should include all aspects of a comprehensive eye examination,* with supplemental testing, as indicated, to detect and thoroughly evaluate ocular complications.</p>
<p class="Note">*Refer to the <a href="http://www.aoa.org/documents/optometrists/CPG-1.pdf" title="American Optometric Association Web site">Optometric Clinical Practice Guideline for Comprehensive Adult Eye and Vision Examination</a>.</p>
<p>Patients should be questioned about the awareness of their personal diabetes ABCs (A1C, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels and their history of smoking).</p>
<p><em>Ocular Examination</em></p>
<p>The initial ocular examination should include, but is not limited to, the following evaluations:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Review of patient medical history </li>
    <li>Best-corrected visual acuity </li>
    <li>Pupillary reflexes </li>
    <li>Ocular motility </li>
    <li>Refractive status </li>
    <li>Confrontation visual field testing or visual field evaluation </li>
    <li>Slit lamp biomicroscopy </li>
    <li>Tonometry </li>
    <li>Dilated retinal examination </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dilated Retinal Examination</span></p>
<p>Retinal examinations for diabetic retinopathy should be performed through a dilated pupil.</p>
<p>When vitreous hemorrhage prevents adequate visualization of the retina, prompt referral to an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease should be made for further evaluation.</p>
<p>The individual's primary care physician should be informed of eye examination results following each examination, even when retinopathy is minimal or not present.</p>
<p><strong>Ocular Examination Schedule</strong></p>
<p><em>Persons with Diabetes Mellitus</em></p>
<p>As diabetes may go undiagnosed for many years, any individual with type 2 diabetes should have a comprehensive dilated eye examination soon after the diagnosis of diabetes (American Diabetes Association, 2013).</p>
<p>Individuals with diabetes should receive at least annual dilated eye examinations. More frequent examination may be needed depending on changes in vision and the severity and progression of diabetic retinopathy.</p>
<p>Women with pre-existing diabetes who are planning pregnancy or who become pregnant should have a comprehensive eye examination prior to a planned pregnancy or during the first trimester, with follow-up during each trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p><em>Persons with Non-retinal Ocular Complications of Diabetes Mellitus</em></p>
<p>Examination of persons with non-retinal ocular complications of diabetes should be consistent with current recommendations of care for each condition.</p>
<p><em>Persons with Retinal Complications of Diabetes Mellitus</em></p>
<p>Prompt referral to a vitreo-retinal surgeon is indicated when a vitreous hemorrhage, a retinal detachment or other evidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy is present.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment and Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Management of Ocular Complications of Diabetes Mellitus</strong></p>
<p><em>Basis for Treatment</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Persons with Non-retinal Ocular Complications</span></p>
<p>Treatment protocols for persons with non-retinal ocular and visual complications should follow current recommendations for care, and include education on the subject and recommendations for follow-up visits.</p>
<p>As part of the proper management of diabetes, the optometrist should make referrals for concurrent care when indicated.</p>
<p><em>Treatment of Retinal Complications</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Laser Photocoagulation</span></p>
<p>Non-proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR)</p>
<p>Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) may be considered in patients with severe or very severe NPDR, or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with a high risk of progression (e.g., pregnancy, poor glycemic control, inability to follow-up, initiation of intensive glycemic control, impending ocular surgery, renal impairment and rapid progression of retinopathy) (Mohamed, Ross, &amp; Chu, 2011). (<strong>A/A</strong>)</p>
<p>Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</p>
<p>Patients with high-risk PDR should receive referral to an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease for prompt scatter PRP (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group [ETDRS], 1991; Chew et al., 2003). (<strong>A/A; B/B</strong>)</p>
<p>Eyes in which PDR has not advanced to the high-risk stage should also be referred for consultation with an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease (ETDRS, 1991; Chew et al., 2003). (<strong>A/A; B/B</strong>)</p>
<p>Following successful treatment with PRP, patients should be re-examined every 2 to 4 months. The follow-up interval may be extended based on disease severity and stability.</p>
<p>Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)</p>
<p>Following focal photocoagulation for DME, re-examination should be scheduled in 3 to 4 months.</p>
<p>Patients with center-involved DME should be referred to an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease for possible treatment.</p>
<p>Individuals with DME, but without clinically significant macular edema (CSME), should be re-examined at 4- to 6-month intervals. Once CSME develops, treatment with focal laser photocoagulation or intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection is indicated (Mohamed, Ross, &amp; Chu, 2011). (<strong>A/A</strong>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vitrectomy</span></p>
<p>Eyes with vitreous hemorrhage (VH), traction retinal detachment (TRD), macular traction or an epiretinal membrane should be referred to an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease for evaluation for possible vitrectomy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Inhibitors</span></p>
<p>The current standard of care for treatment of center-involved DME in persons with best corrected visual acuity of 20/32 or worse, is anti-VEGF injections (Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, 2008; Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network et al., 2010). (<strong>A/A</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Patient Education</em></p>
<p>Persons should be educated about the ocular signs and symptoms of diabetic retinopathy and other non-retinal complications of diabetes, and encouraged to comply with recommendations for follow-up eye examinations and care.</p>
<p>Individuals should be advised of the risks of smoking related to diabetes and encouraged to quit smoking and/or seek smoking cessation assistance.</p>
<p>Individuals should be educated about the long-term benefits of glucose control in saving sight, based on their individual medically appropriate A1C target.</p>
<p><strong>Management of Systemic Complications and Co-morbidities of Diabetes Mellitus</strong></p>
<p><em>Glycemic Control</em></p>
<p>The glycemic goal for persons with diabetes should be individualized, taking into consideration their risk of hypoglycemia, anticipated life expectancy, duration of disease and co-morbid conditions (American Diabetes Association, 2013).</p>
<p>Optometrists should have a rapid-acting carbohydrate (e.g., glucose gel or tablets, sugar-sweetened beverage or fruit juice) in their office for use with diabetes patients who experience acute hypoglycemia during an eye examination.</p>
<p><em>Lipid-Lowering Treatment</em></p>
<p>The majority of persons with diabetes are at risk of coronary heart disease and can benefit from reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels to the currently recommended targets (Knopp et al., 2006). (<strong>B/B</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Weight Management</em></p>
<p>When indicated, overweight individuals should be referred to a qualified health care provider for assistance with weight loss.</p>
<p><em>Treatment Modalities</em></p>
<p>Individuals with diabetes should receive nutrition and dietary recommendations preferably provided by a registered dietician who is knowledgeable about diabetes management.</p>
<p><strong>Management of Persons with Visual Impairment</strong></p>
<p>Individuals who experience vision loss from diabetes should be provided, or referred for, a comprehensive examination of their visual impairment by a practitioner trained or experienced in vision rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Persons with diabetes who experience visual difficulties should be counseled on the availability and scope of vision rehabilitation care and encouraged to utilize these services.</p>
<p>Referral for counseling is indicated for any individual experiencing difficulty dealing with vision and/or health issues associated with diabetes or diabetic retinopathy. Educational literature and a list of support agencies and other resources should be made available to these individuals.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>During two articulation meetings of the Evidence-Based Optometry Guideline Development Group (GDG), all evidence was reviewed and clinical recommendations were developed. Grading for the recommendations were based on the quality of the research and the benefits and risks of the procedure or therapy recommended. Where direct scientific evidence to support a recommendation was weak or lacking, a consensus of the Evidence-Based Optometry Subcommittee members was required to approve a recommendation.</p>
<p>Two clinicians independently read each assigned paper and recorded the clinical recommendation(s) gleaned from the paper. These statements were then graded on the strength of the recommendation as stated in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). The results were recorded on an Evidence and Recommendation Grading Sheet and returned to American Optometric Association (AOA) staff for transparency documentation.</p>
<p>Two articulation meetings were held to formulate wording and vote on the clinical recommendations submitted by the readers. The recommendations were articulated, given a final strength of recommendation grade, and voted on by the Guideline Development Reading Group, based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>If both readers of a paper were in agreement with the strength of recommendation grade &ndash; each grading the paper above or below the A-B/C-D line &ndash; the lowest grade of the two (above or below the line) would be recorded. </li>
    <li>If there were three readers for a paper, the strength of recommendation grade defaults to the majority (above or below the A-B/C-D line) and the lowest grade of the two, above or below the line, is recorded. </li>
    <li>Only papers receiving an A or B grade for strength of clinical recommendation were included in the guideline. </li>
</ul>
<p>The discussions and votes were recorded for transparency documentation, and the final document was forwarded to the clinical practice guideline writer.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Until modalities are in place to prevent or cure diabetic retinopathy and other complications of diabetes mellitus, emphasis must be placed on identification, careful follow-up, and timely treatment, including laser photocoagulation, for patients with diabetic retinopathy and diabetic eye disease. Proper care will result in reduction of personal suffering for those involved and a substantial cost savings for the involved individuals, their families, and the country as a whole.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Complications and side effects of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) include visual field constriction, night blindness, color vision changes, decreased accommodation, scotoma, anisocoria, glaucoma and traction retinal detachment. PRP may worsen retinal thickening in some patients with center-involved macular edema. Since the relative risk of vision loss in patients without high-risk characteristics is low, treatment of clinically significant macular edema (CSME) or center-involved diabetic macular edema (DME) should be considered before panretinal laser photocoagulation is used. </li>
    <li>Potential complications of vitrectomy include neovascular glaucoma, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal tear formation, cataract and endophthalmitis. Glaucoma is more likely to occur in people with associated preoperative retinal detachment. </li>
    <li>The use of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) has been associated with the risk of elevated intraocular pressure and the rates of visually significant cataracts were substantially higher compared to eyes receiving focal/grid laser treatment. </li>
    <li>Long-term systemic&nbsp;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition can result in increased risk of ischemic and thromboembolic events. </li>
    <li>Ocular adverse events resulting from the intravitreal injection itself include endophthalmitis, ocular inflammation, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage and traumatic cataract. </li>
    <li>Bevacizumab (Avastin&reg;) is approved for treatment of cancer and its systemic use is known to be associated with an increased risk of stroke. It is unknown if a substantially smaller dose, when used intravitreally, has any significant systemic toxicity. It is used off-label for the treatment of DME. </li>
    <li>Clinicians should use caution in administering topically applied drugs for pupillary dilation in pregnant women. Topically applied drugs for pupillary dilation, such as tropicamide, hydroxyamphetamine and phenylephrine are Pregnancy Category C drugs. </li>
