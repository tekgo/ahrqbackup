<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of women with invasive cervical cancer&mdash;non-squamous cell carcinomas who are diagnosed within greater than 3 to 5 years since previous Pap test.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The introduction of cervical cancer screening using the Papanicolaou test (Pap test) has led to significant reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Canada. From 1977 to 2015, the incidence of invasive cervical cancer declined from 15.4 per 100,000 to an estimated 7.5 per 100,000 and invasive cervical cancer mortality declined from 4.8 per 100,000 to an estimated 1.6 per 100,000 (Canadian Cancer Society, Advisory Committee on Cancer Statistics, 2015). Despite this success, in 2015, an estimated 1,500 Canadian women will be diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer and 380 will die from the disease (Canadian Cancer Society, Advisory Committee on Cancer Statistics, 2015). Many of these women were not screened in the five years before their diagnosis, were not followed up appropriately after an abnormal Pap test result, or the Pap test failed to detect their cancer. Additionally, women with lower levels of income, education, new immigrants, women living in rural or remote locations, and who have limited access to screening are less likely to be screened (Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, 2014). For these reasons, it is critical to continuously monitor and evaluate cervical cancer screening to ensure that Canadian women receive high-quality cancer prevention services.</p>
<p>Screening history in cases of invasive cancer is a retrospective summary of screening prior to diagnosis. Screening history is measured by the percentage of women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer whose last Pap test was less than 6 months (likely performed during a diagnostic appointment rather than screening purposes), 6 months to less than 3 years (within the guidelines), 3 to 5 years (overdue), or more than 5 years before the date of cancer diagnosis. More than 5 years includes women who had no record of a Pap test.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

<div class='field field_picklist-choice'>
<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A clinical practice guideline or other peer-reviewed synthesis of the clinical research evidence
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A systematic review of the clinical research literature (e.g., Cochrane Review)
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
One or more research studies published in a National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexed, peer-reviewed journal
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Cervical cancer is caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) (Trottier &amp; Franco, 2006; Dawar, Deeks, &amp; Dobson, 2007). Of the more than 100 types of identified HPV, 40 infect the genital tract; of these, approximately 15 are considered high risk, with types 16 and 18 causally linked to 70% of cervical cancer cases. HPV is a highly prevalent sexually transmitted virus; peak prevalence occurs during adolescence and the early 20s after the commencement of sexual activity. </p>
<p>Most HPV infections are transient and are cleared by the immune system without signs or symptoms. However, a small percentage of women experience persistent infections. For these women, the average time between becoming infected with a high risk HPV type and developing a pre-cancerous lesion is 24 months, with a further eight to 12 years before the development of invasive cervical cancer. Because of this long latency period, screening is an effective strategy for the identification and treatment of pre-cancerous cervical lesions.</p></div>
