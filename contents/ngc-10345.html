Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the grading of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Weak, Further research needed</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Does Education of Prescribers Improve Parenteral Nutrition (PN) Ordering?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers suggest providing education to healthcare professionals to improve PN ordering, thereby reducing errors.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Maximum Safe Osmolarity of PN Admixtures Intended for Peripheral Vein Administration?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers suggest that PN with an osmolarity of up to 900 mOsm/L can be safely infused peripherally. Higher osmolarity limits, especially when peripheral PN is prepared as a total nutrient admixture (TNA), may also be tolerated, but the evidence to support a safe limit is lacking.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Appropriate Calcium Intake and Calcium-Phosphate Ratios (Ca:P) in PN for Optimal Neonatal Bone Mineralization?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers recommend an elemental calcium intake of 76 mg/kg per day for short-term PN in neonates.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Strong</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers suggest a Ca:P ratio of 1.7:1 (mg:mg) or 1.3:1 (mmol:mmol) in short-term PN in neonates.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Clinical Advantages or Disadvantages of Commercially Available Premade ("Premixed") Multichambered PN Formulations Compared With Compounded PN Formulations?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers suggest that commercially available premade multichambered PN products be considered as an available option for patients alongside compounded (customized or standardized) PN formulations to best meet an organization's patient needs.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Clinical (Infection, Catheter Occlusion) Advantages or Disadvantages of 2-in-1 Compared With 3-in-1 PN Admixtures?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers suggest that there is no clinical difference in infectious complications between the two PN delivery systems; 3-in-1 formulations administered in the homecare setting may increase the risk for catheter occlusion and shorten catheter lifespan.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Macronutrient Dosing Limits Are Expected to Provide for the Most Stable 3-in-1 Admixtures?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers recommend that total nutrient admixtures maintain final concentrations of amino acid &ge;4%, monohydrated dextrose &ge;10%, and injectable lipid emulsion &ge;2% to be more likely to remain stable for up to 30 hours at room temperature (25&deg;C) or for 9 days refrigerated (5&deg;C) followed by 24 hours at room temperature.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Strong</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Most Appropriate Recommendations for Optimizing Calcium (Gluconate) and (Na- or K-) Phosphate Compatibility in PN Admixtures?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers cannot make a recommendation due to the multiple variations in amino acid concentrations, PN volume, pH, presence or absence of fat emulsion, and the amounts of other minerals (e.g., magnesium). The guideline developers suggest that published graphs for specific products provide adequate guidance; however, no evidence indicates that these formulations remain stable for &gt;24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Micronutrient Contamination Is Present in Parenteral Stock Solutions Currently Used to Compound PN Admixtures?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers suggest that, given the level of mineral contamination found in parenteral stock solutions used to compound PN admixtures, practitioners purchase products that accurately describe levels of contamination and also take that exposure into account when recommending or reviewing trace element dosing.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it Safe to Use the PN Admixture as a Vehicle for Non-Nutrient Medication Delivery?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers recommend that non-nutrient medication be included in PN admixtures <em>only</em> when supported by (1) pharmaceutical data describing physicochemical compatibility and stability of (a) the additive medication and (b) the final preparation under conditions of typical use, and (2) clinical data confirming the expected therapeutic actions of the medication. Extrapolation beyond the parameter limits (e.g., products, concentrations) of the given data is discouraged.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Strong</strong></p>
<p><strong>Should Heparin Be Included in the PN Admixture to Reduce the Risk of Central Vein Thrombosis?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers suggest that heparin not be included in PN admixtures for reducing the risk of central vein thrombosis in adults.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Weak</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Methods of Repackaging Intravenous Fat Emulsion (IVFE) Into Smaller Patient-Specific Volumes Are Safe?</strong></p>
<p>The guideline developers recommend against the repackaging of IVFE into syringes for administration to patients. The guideline developers suggest that other methodologies for repackaged IVFE, such as drawn-down IVFE units, are preferable.</p>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Strong</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Beyond-Use Date (BUD) Should be Used for (a) IVFE Dispensed for Separate Infusion in the Original Container and (b) Repackaged IVFE?</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>The guideline developers recommend that the BUD for unspiked IVFE in the original container should be based on the manufacturer's provided information. The BUD for IVFE in the original container spiked for infusion should be 12 to 24 hours. </li>
    <li>Although repackaged IVFE is not recommended, when used, the BUD for IVFE transferred from the original container to another container for infusion separately from a 2-in-1 PN solution should be 12 hours. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>GRADE</em>: <strong>Strong</strong></p>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Clinical Guidelines have adopted concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. Briefly, specific clinical questions where nutrition support is a relevant mode of therapy are developed and key clinical outcomes are identified. A rigorous search of the published literature is conducted, each included study is assessed for research quality, tables of findings are developed, and the body of evidence for the question is evaluated and graded. Randomized controlled clinical trials are initially graded as strong evidence but may be downgraded in quality based on study limitations. Controlled observational studies are initially graded as weak evidence but may be graded down further based on study limitations or upgraded based on study design strengths. In a consensus process, the authors make recommendations for clinical practice that are based on the evidence review assessed against consideration of the risks and benefits to patients. Recommendations are graded as strong when the evidence is strong and/or the risk vs benefit analysis is strong. Weak recommendations may be based on weaker evidence and/or weaker trade-offs to the patient. When limited research is available to answer a question, the recommendation is for further research to be conducted.</p>
<p>Evaluating the safety of nutrition preparations and products often requires data derived from in vitro studies. Some of the vital safety-related questions with patient outcome implications that made use of in vitro evidence were included in this document. For example, in vitro data are necessary to evaluate stability, compatibility, and sterility. Although these studies do not align with the GRADE process, they are just as critical to the integrity of safe parenteral nutrition (PN) use in clinical practice. In these cases, the work group still conducted literature searches evaluated the study quality, and provided evidence tables. Manuscripts were uniformly evaluated against quality criteria and are provided in the tables of evidence. The strength of recommendations based on in vitro data follows author considerations for potential risks to patients as well as the available evidence.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Many clinicians find that "premixed"&nbsp;parenteral nutrition (PN) formulations often will not meet the caloric, amino acid, and electrolyte needs of critically ill patients, who are often obese, require fluid restriction, and display hepatic/renal dysfunction. These products have particularly been criticized for their high dextrose concentrations, which could increase the risk of hyperglycemia and infection. Patient safety data are lacking for a reduction of errors associated with "premixed" PN products in relation to prescribing, compounding, and administration.&nbsp;"Premixed" PN formulations can be useful in appropriate patient populations when screened and assessed by suitably trained clinicians with expertise in nutrition support therapy. </li>
    <li>The primary drawback of the 3-in-1 PN system is that it requires a larger pore size filter (1.2 &mu;m) and precludes the use of a 0.22- &mu;m filter, which eliminates a greater amount of particulate matter including some bacteria. The 3-in-1 system also suffers from a higher risk for emulsion destabilization from inappropriate concentrations of nutrients as well as a greater incidence of medication incompatibility with the fat emulsion portion of the admixture. </li>

Clinical Guidelines are based upon general conclusions of health professionals who, in developing such Clinical Guidelines, have balanced potential benefits to be derived from a particular mode of medical therapy against certain risks inherent with such therapy. However, the professional judgment of the attending health professional is the primary component of quality medical care. Because guidelines cannot account for every variation in circumstances, the practitioner must always exercise professional judgment in the application of these guidelines.
