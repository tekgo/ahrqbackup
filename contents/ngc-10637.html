<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Question 1: Should Primary Antifungal Prophylaxis Be Used to Prevent Invasive Fungal Infection (IFI) in Children Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT)? If So, What Medication (Dose and Duration) Should Be Used?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1.1: Allogeneic HSCT During and Immediately Following Conditioning</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For children one month to less than 19 years of age undergoing allogeneic HSCT, administer fluconazole 6&ndash;12 mg/kg/day (maximum 400 mg/day) intravenous (IV) or oral (PO) from the start of conditioning until engraftment (<strong>strong recommendation, high quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>For the above children where fluconazole is contraindicated, administer an echinocandin as an alternative to fluconazole (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Adjust fluconazole dose in children with renal impairment. Consideration may be given to initiating antifungal prophylaxis on the day of transplant for patients receiving conditioning agents known or suspected to interact with fluconazole.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1.2: Allogeneic HSCT with Acute Grade II-IV Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) or Chronic Extensive GVHD</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For children 13 years of age or older undergoing allogeneic HSCT with acute Grade II&ndash;IV or chronic extensive GVHD, prophylaxis with posaconazole 200 mg PO three times a day (TID) from GVHD diagnosis until resolution of acute Grade II-IV GVHD or chronic extensive GVHD is suggested (<strong>weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>For the above children where posaconazole is contraindicated, fluconazole 6 &ndash; 12 mg/kg/day (maximum 400 mg/day) IV/PO is suggested as an alternative to posaconazole (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children one month to less than 13 years of age, fluconazole 6&ndash;12 mg/kg/day (maximum 400 mg/day) IV/PO from GVHD diagnosis until resolution of acute Grade II&ndash;IV GVHD or chronic extensive GVHD is suggested (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>). </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Identification and Appraisal of Existing Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<p>The initial stages of this project were informed by the guideline adaptation methodology developed by the ADAPTE Collaboration and CAN-ADAPTE. The ADAPTE process is a systematic approach to considering the use and/or modification of existing guidelines developed in one context for application in a different context, so as to enhance the efficient production and use of high-quality adapted guidelines. The strategies for searching for guidelines and guideline adaptation are outlined in Appendix D in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>In May and June of 2010, the Guideline for Primary Antifungal Prophylaxis for Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Patients Development Panel completed a comprehensive literature review with librarian support to identify guidelines on the use of antifungal prophylaxis in patients with malignancy or undergoing stem cell transplantation. The guideline search was conducted through to June 2010. The search details including search terms are provided in Appendix D in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>To summarize in brief, literature searches of MEDLINE (OvidSP; 1966 to April Week 2 2011), Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp; Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; OvidSP and EBSCO host; 1980 to April 2011) and PubMed were performed. Grey literature was searched by using the search engine Google. Individual panel members also reviewed their personal files, professional association documents and their own institutional documents for guidelines that were relevant for review.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Search Results</strong></p>
<p>Five guidelines on antifungal prophylaxis were identified and assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &amp; Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. All five guidelines were focused primarily on adult recommendations with a limited pediatric information. Based on the overall assessment of the guidelines and the number of recommendations received, it was a unanimous group decision to use the Infectious Disease Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Haematology and Oncology Recommendations for "Primary prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies" as the basis for guideline adaptation. The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) Guidelines for preventing infectious complications among Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Recipients as well as National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines on prevention and treatment of cancer-related infections were identified as having strengths that would be used to influence the development of the present guideline. A subsequent search also identified the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guideline that was also considered in this guideline development.</p>
<p>Despite the number of guidelines to provide direction on the use of antifungal prophylaxis, there was a lack of evidence-based guidelines that were specifically within the scope of antifungal prophylaxis for pediatric patients. Both the ASBMT and NCCN guidelines are general guidelines based primarily on adult literature. The AGIHO guidelines were felt to be more rigorous and complete and formatted in a manner that would suit the purposes of this guideline. However, the AGIHO guidelines are also largely based on adult patient data. It is recognized that extrapolation of adult recommendations to the pediatric population is not always appropriate considering the differences in clinical disease, treatment protocols and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the medications. As a result, it was decided that a comprehensive search of both pediatric and adult literature was appropriate in order to expand the evidence base on which to make recommendations and allow for emphasis to be placed on pediatric literature.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Systematic Review of Primary Studies</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Primary Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Panel members ran searches using the OVID search platform in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials (CCTR). In addition, panel members searched conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology (2004&ndash;2011). The tables and text presented in Appendix E in the original guideline document record the search strategies and terms used. The initial search was conducted September 8, 2011 and updated August 29, 2012. The updated search yielded one additional study requiring inclusion after the content and stakeholder review. However, the results did not impact the recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<p><em>Types of Studies</em></p>
<p>All randomized controlled trials comparing two antifungal agents, placebo or no prophylaxis were included. Trials were from any year and in any language.</p>
<p><em>Population</em></p>
<p>Trials conducted in patients of any age receiving chemotherapy for cancer or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (regardless of source of stem cells) were included. Trials involving patients with previous fungal disease were excluded (i.e., secondary antifungal prophylaxis trials).</p>
<p><em>Intervention</em></p>
<p>Trials involving any of the following antifungal agents were included as long as they were administered systemically for prophylaxis: amphotericin B (conventional and lipid formulations), caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole or posaconazole. Trials with nonsystemic antifungals were excluded (i.e., oral or inhaled amphotericin). Studies of pre-emptive or empiric therapy or antifungal treatment were excluded.</p>
<p><em>Comparison</em></p>
<p>Trials comparing a systemic antifungal agent to either another systemic antifungal agent, placebo or no prophylaxis were included. Trials were excluded if more than one anti-fungal agent (systemic or nonsystemic) was given in the treatment or comparator arm (i.e., combined prophylaxis trials).</p>
<p><em>Outcome</em></p>
<p>The outcomes of interest included: proven or probable invasive fungal infection (IFI), fungal-related mortality, overall mortality and adverse events. Trials reporting on only suspected IFI, empiric antifungal therapy use or fungal colonization were excluded.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Selection Criteria and Appraisal</strong></p>
<p>The guideline inclusion/exclusion criteria are outlined in detail in Appendix D in the original guideline document. Guidelines identified through the search were reviewed by the panel for relevance. Each guideline considered potentially relevant was independently reviewed and scored by 4 panel members, using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &amp; Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. The AGREE instrument provides a framework for the evaluation of guideline quality on the basis of 6 domains: scope and purpose; stakeholder involvement; rigour of involvement; clarity and presentation; applicability; and editorial independence. Domain scores and overall assessments from each reviewer were compiled for each guideline, and results were presented for discussion at an in-person panel meeting. Panel members were provided copies of all guidelines to facilitate discussion of the results and reach consensus on the suitability of each guideline for guideline adaptation via the ADAPTE process. Each guideline was discussed as to why they were or were not recommended. Particular attention was paid to rigor scores and guideline scope.</p>
<p>The selected guideline was to be updated by literature published since its development. However, after reviewing the available guidelines, it was determined that none of the guidelines considered pediatric specific literature. As a result, it was decided to undertake a comprehensive review of both pediatric and adult literature in order to develop a broader evidence base on which to make recommendations and allow for an emphasis to be placed on pediatric evidence.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Development Panel</strong></p>
<p>The C<sup>17</sup> Guidelines Committee identified antifungal prophylaxis as a key supportive care initiative in 2009. The C<sup>17</sup> Antifungal Prophylaxis Working Group was formed in June 2009. Members were selected from C<sup>17</sup> sites across Canada with the aim to have an inter-disciplinary team including individuals with content expertise and guideline development experience.</p>
<p><strong>Decision-Making Process for Formulation of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations were developed for each of the <em>a priori</em> identified patient populations (allogeneic stem cell transplantation, autologous stem cell transplantation, acute myeloid leukemia [AML]/myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] and malignancy with anticipated neutropenia greater than 7 days). Included trials were considered in the evidence base for a specific patient population if the population accounted for more than 40% of the patients in the trial. This meant that some trials were considered for evidence in more than one patient population. Trials conducted in homogeneous patient populations were given higher weight as were pediatric specific trials and trials that included children.</p>
<p>For each patient population, the evidence base was reviewed by the committee members. Recommendations were established through panel discussions, whereby any differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. If consensus was unable to be reached, a vote was cast. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were assessed using the GRADE system developed by Guyatt et al. by the lead author and confirmed through discussion by the remaining panel members. The panel purposely did not seek to include patient input because the primary outcomes of interest were development of invasive fungal infection (IFI), fungal-related mortality and overall mortality. The panel felt that these decisions were made primarily by healthcare teams rather than patients. However, the impact of prophylaxis on patients was considered when making the recommendations, including ease/route of drug administration, tolerability and adverse effects. The panel also considered cultural issues, but did not identify any for this guideline.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>External Review Process</strong></p>
<p>The draft guideline was reviewed in a two stage process; content review and stakeholder review. Initially, the guideline was reviewed by a panel of experts in pediatric hematology/oncology and infectious disease. A total of 17 experts were contacted to review the document on December 4, 2011. Eleven of 17 experts responded. The experts were asked to complete a questionnaire; their responses and the panel's responses, including changes to the draft guideline, are summarized in Appendix F in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Secondly, the guideline was sent to all C<sup>17</sup> sites for stakeholder review on April 30, 2012. Similar to the content review process, the stakeholders were asked to complete a questionnaire; their responses and the panel's responses/guideline changes are summarized in Appendix F in the original guideline document. A total of 42 responses were received. All cancer centers across Canada had at least one representative with the exception of one center.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>C<sup>17</sup> supportive care guidelines are developed by Canadian health professional specialists using evidence-based or best practice references at the time of their creation. Format and content of the guidelines will change as they are reviewed and revised on a periodic basis. Care has been taken to ensure accuracy of the information. However, any physician or health professional using these guidelines will be responsible for administering care according to their own institutional policies and standards. </li>
    <li>This guideline has been developed within the context of pediatric oncology and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). It is acknowledged that the recommendations presented here are based on the available evidence and that there are many gaps. Readers are reminded that implementation of these recommendations will require adaptation to the local context appreciating factors such as individual patient needs and preferences, clinician knowledge, skill and practice scope, available resources and organizational policies and standards. The choice of antifungal may also be affected by patient co-morbidities, the local incidence and prevalence of fungal disease, local epidemiology and environmental factors, antifungal resistance patterns, and potential drug-drug interactions. </li>
    <li>The information contained in this document was prepared with care. However, any application of this material is expected to be based on judicious independent medical assessment in the context of individual clinical circumstances or with the input of a qualified clinician. The C<sup>17</sup> Guidelines Committee does not make any guarantees of any kind with respect to the content or use or application of this guideline.

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Implementation Considerations</strong></p>
<p>The guideline will be circulated to the seventeen Canadian centers providing tertiary pediatric hematology/oncology care for feedback prior to finalization of the guideline. This is an essential step to identify and address concerns and build consensus. This will also allow identification of center specific barriers to guideline implementation and develop multi-faceted implementation strategies targeting these barriers to change. The aspect most likely to cause difficulty in implementation is the site availability and financial burden of some of the recommended antifungal agents (i.e., posaconazole). To deal with this, panel members plan to specifically target administrators of health care institutions, insurance companies and pharmacies with educational interventions. Alternative antifungal agents are also presented in the guideline for those instances where a medication is contraindicated or not available.</p>
<p>A second aspect that may affect implementation is the geographical differences in fungal species, including higher rates of mold infections at certain centers. This may result in some centers recommending the use of broader agents to include mold coverage when our recommendation is for a narrower agent.</p>
<p>It will also be essential to communicate the recommendations to physicians, nurses and pharmacists at the various C<sup>17</sup>sites. To accomplish this knowledge transfer, panel members will employ multiple strategies including educational interventions, monitoring and feedback and collaborative care with pharmacists. Panel members will identify key stakeholders at the various C<sup>17</sup>hospital sites to conduct small group sessions to disseminate the information to other physicians, nurses and pharmacists with the goal of incorporating these antifungal prophylaxis recommendations into protocols. A key component of this knowledge transfer will be to educate health care providers about the use of prophylaxis and considerations if a patient develops an invasive fungal infection (IFI) having received antifungal prophylaxis. In general, the use of a chemoprophylaxis strategy based on one antifungal class, precludes use of members of that class for therapy. Finally, computerized real-time alerts could provide reminders to physicians to order antifungal prophylaxis when patients are admitted for chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.</p>
<p><strong>Tools for Application</strong></p>
<p>Appropriate information and support will be provided to families so as to facilitate decision-making regarding the risks and benefits of antifungal prophylaxis when the guideline has been approved.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Barriers and Cost Implications</strong></p>
<p>Potential organizational barriers/cost implications to applying the recommendations found in this guideline include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Inability to obtain antifungal agents </li>
    <li>Costs of some antifungal agents </li>
</ul>
<p>Patient/ family preferences:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Religious or other objection to antifungal prophylaxis </li>
    <li>Administration limitations of some antifungal agents (need for intravenous medication vs. oral) </li>
