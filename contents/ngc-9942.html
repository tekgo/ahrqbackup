<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post- Polypectomy</span></strong></p>
<p>The majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from adenomas, the 'adenoma&ndash;carcinoma sequence'. Two major types of polyps are found in the colon and rectum: adenomas and hyperplastic polyps. Hyperplastic polyps are considered to have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span></strong> malignant potential.</p>

</table>
<p class="Note">*Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is an appropriate follow-up modality for this group. FOBT should not be used until 10 years after the last colonoscopy for the hyperplastic polyp patient. All other risk groups above should not be followed with FOBT.</p>
<p class="Note">**Individuals with HNPCC or FAP should be referred to the Hereditary Cancer Program at the BC Cancer Agency for assessment, counseling and if appropriate, genetic testing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post-Cancer Resection</span></strong></p>
<p>The goal of follow-up after resection is to identify recurrent disease or metastases and to detect subsequent adenomas. These recommendations are generally expert consensus-based. Patients with significant co-morbidities, very advanced age or limited 5 year life expectancy are not routinely offered surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up Visits with Family Physician</strong></p>
<p>Focused history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for a total of 5 years (Desch et al, 2005; National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2012). It is recommended that each follow-up visit include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>History to elicit gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms, including nutritional status. </li>
    <li>Physical examination with particular attention to the abdomen, liver and rectal evaluation (or perineal inspection and palpation in those patients who have had an abdominal perineal resection). </li>
    <li>Routine laboratory investigations, such as liver chemistry, in the absence of symptoms are not useful. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controversies in Care</strong></p>
<p>Aspirin (and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS]) has been shown to reduce the incidence of subsequent colorectal adenomas and cancer, but because of potential adverse effects it is currently not recommended (Din et al., 2010).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tumour Markers</span></strong></p>
<p>A carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test is recommended at diagnosis of CRC and repeated to monitor rising levels of CEA (at least doubling) which can indicate hepatic or pulmonary metastases. Eligible patients for surveillance with CEA are those with stage II or III tumors (i.e., tumour through the bowel wall or metastatic to locoregional lymph nodes). These patients are offered CEA every 3 months for the first 3 years and every 6 months during years 4 and 5. No CEA is required beyond 5 years.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Imaging and X-Rays</span></strong></p>
<p>Liver imaging, by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan (CT preferable) (Kinkel et al., 2002; Miles &amp; Burkill, 2007), is recommended every 6 months for the first 3 years, then once per year for 2 more years (Figueredo et al., 2003). For those with advanced stage cancers or undergoing chemotherapy, follow the recommendations of the oncologist (Desch et al., 2005; Pfister, Benson, &amp; Somerfield, 2004). Routine CT scanning is not recommended beyond 5 years.</p>
<p>There is little evidence to show a survival benefit for routine chest x-ray for post CRC resection patients (Gan, Wilson, &amp; Hollington, 2007). A chest CT scan is recommended for every 12 months for the first 3 years in cases of advanced cancer or rectal cancer (Desch et al., 2005; NCCN, 2012).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Colonoscopy</span></strong></p>
<p>Patients with CRC should undergo a complete cancer and polyp clearing colonoscopy prior to or within 12 months of surgical resection of the colorectal tumour. A colonoscopy should follow at one year after resection or clearing colonoscopy (Brooks et al., 2008; NCCN, 2012). If the one year colonoscopy is normal, the next colonoscopy should be performed in 3 years; if those results are normal, the next colonoscopy should be performed in 5 years (Brooks et al., 2008; NCCN, 2012) to look for another primary colorectal malignancy or adenomatous polyps. After the one year colonoscopy, the intervals between subsequent colonoscopies may be shortened if there is evidence of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) or if adenoma findings warrant earlier colonoscopy.</p>
<p>Performance of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is unnecessary in patients undergoing colonoscopic surveillance (Winawer et al., 2006).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surveillance after 5 Years</span></strong></p>
<p>Continued surveillance is recommended with a colonoscopy conducted every 5 years. There is no place for FOBT in this population.</p></div>
