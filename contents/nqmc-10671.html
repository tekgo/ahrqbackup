Description

<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of women aged 51 to 74 years who have had at least one mammogram performed during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease among women in Israel, comprising 30% of all cancer cases among Israeli women (Ministry of Health, 2014). The relative survival rates among women with breast cancer have improved and mortality rates have fallen in Israel over the last few years (Ministry of Health, 2014) - an improvement that can be partially attributed to early detection and treatment. Israel's Ministry of Health recommends performing mammography screening once every two years, among women aged 50 to 74 with regular risk within a targeted screening program, commensurate with the recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, 2009). This screening program extends personal invitations to all eligible women. Meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing women who underwent mammography screening versus those who did not showed a decrease of 6% to 23% in breast cancer mortality among those who were screening compared to the control group (G&oslash;tzsche &amp; J&oslash;rgensen, 2013).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Data quality assessment as well as performance audits were carried out in three stages: by each health plan, by the Quality Indicators in Community Healthcare (QICH) program directorate and by an accredited external auditor. Data checks that included logical tests for negative numbers, unit tests, and valid numerator and denominator entries as well as tests examining subgroups and changes over time were performed by each health plan internally and by the QICH program directorate. An external auditor conducted a procedural audit for each health plan as well as the for the QICH directorate. </p></div>
