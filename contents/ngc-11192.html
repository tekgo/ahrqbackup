Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of recommendation (<strong>1A&ndash;2C, consensus-based [CB]</strong>) and the approach to rating the quality of evidence are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In adult and adolescent athletes (&ge;12 years of age) complaining of acute or recurrent cough, the Expert Panel suggests to initially evaluate for the most commonly reported causes of cough in this group such as asthma, exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), respiratory tract infections (RTIs), upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) due to rhinosinus conditions, and environmental exposures related to the sport training environments (<strong>Ungraded, Consensus Based</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult and adolescent athletes (&ge;12 years of age) complaining of acute or recurrent cough, the Expert Panel suggests that pulmonary function tests, particularly bronchoprovocation challenges, and assessment of allergy to common airborne allergens be performed in the investigation of cough to identify common etiologies such as asthma and EIB, and to evaluate the effects of environmental exposures such as allergens, respiratory irritants, and pollutants (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult and adolescent athletes (&ge;12 years of age) complaining of acute or recurrent cough, the Expert Panel suggests to proceed with a systematic investigation based on suspected cause(s) from initial clinical assessment, with specific attention to the athlete's particular sport and training environment and context (exercise related or not) in which cough occurs, to determine its etiology (<strong>Ungraded, Consensus Based</strong>). </li>
    <li>In adult and adolescent athletes (&ge;12 years of age) complaining of cough, the Expert Panel suggests a treatment trial directed at the suspected causes of cough similarly to the general population, but taking into account the sport performed and training environment. The anti-doping regulations and potential side effects of medications that could interfere with training performances should be reviewed and considered when appropriate (<strong>Ungraded, Consensus Based</strong>).
    <p>Remarks: Anti-doping regulations are provided by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) (<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org" title="World Anti-Doping Agency Web site">https://www.wada-ama.org</a>). The World Anti-Doping Code is a document that brings consistency to anti-doping rules, regulations, and policies worldwide. It is updated annually and the Prohibited List identifies the substances and methods prohibited to athletes in and out of competition. The Global Drug Reference Online (Global DRO) provides athletes and support personnel with information about the prohibited status of specific substances based on the current WADA Prohibited List. The Global DRO provides specific information on products sold in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The Global DRO is created through a partnership between UK Sport, the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, and the US Anti-Doping Agency (<a href="http://www.globaldro.com/Home" title="Global DRO Web site">http://www.globaldro.com/Home</a>). </p>
    </li>
    <li>In adult and adolescent athletes (&ge;12 years of age) complaining of acute and recurrent cough, the Expert Panel suggests that investigators perform randomized control trials to assess the effects of disease-specific and/or environment-specific (e.g., cold-air-induced cough) treatments on cough because there are minimal data on how to optimally treat cough in these groups (<strong>Ungraded, Consensus Based</strong>). </li>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>Systematic review of the literature was performed. Studies published in PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were identified using the following search terms: (cough OR exercise induced asthma OR rhinitis OR sinusitis OR laryngitis OR GERD OR gastro-esophageal reflux OR gastroesophageal reflux OR "chronic eosinophilic bronchitis" OR bronchoconstriction OR "environmental exposures" OR "vocal cord" OR "upper airway diseases" OR allergies) AND (athlete OR athletes OR skiers OR skiing OR swimmers OR swimming OR runners OR rowing OR marathon OR Olympic OR "competitive sports") were identified. The search was limited to articles in French and English; it began with the initiation of these databases and ended in April 2015.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Being aware that there were only a few clinical trials on cough in the athlete, the Expert Panel included all types of study designs in the list of articles to review. References of included studies were searched to identify additional relevant publications. The study characteristics and inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected from the patient problem or population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) elements for all key clinical questions (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). To be included, studies had to meet the following criteria: subjects were described as athletes, adults and adolescents aged &ge;12 years who complained of acute or recurrent cough, regardless of the duration and relationship to exercise. A subject was considered an athlete if he/she participated in an organized team or individual sport and took part in regular sport competitions against other athletes. Ideally, the sport had to require some form of systematic and usually intense training, regardless of the level of competition or number of training hours.</p>
<p>Two authors independently analyzed the titles and content of the abstracts recovered to assess inclusion criteria. From the selected titles and abstracts, full reports about potentially relevant studies were obtained, and the authors independently assessed eligibility of the studies. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. A third author was available to help resolve disagreements if necessary.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>For randomized controlled trials, the reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias criteria using criteria in the Cochrane Reviews. The criteria used were random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) to the study protocol, blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), and selective reporting (reporting bias). Quality assessment of observational studies was also performed.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Framework</span></strong></p>
<p>Grading of recommendations/suggestions was made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework as adopted by CHEST. This framework separates the process of rating the quality of evidence from that of determining the strength of the recommendation. The quality of evidence was based on risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, reporting bias, and imprecision. The quality of evidence (i.e., the confidence in estimates) was rated as high (A), moderate (B), and low or very low (C). The strength of recommendation was determined based on the quality of evidence and the balance of benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, and availability of resources. Level 1 represented strong recommendations in which benefits or harms clearly outweighed the other. Level 2 represented a weak recommendation in which it was not clear that the benefits outweighed the harms (or vice versa), and new research could change the direction or strength of these recommendations (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Developing Recommendations/Suggestions</span></strong></p>
<p>To be included in this guideline, a recommendation or suggestion had to be voted on by 75% of the eligible members of the entire Cough Expert Panel and achieve ratings of "strongly agree" or "agree" by 80% of the voting panelists. No cough panel member was excluded from voting.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The guideline aimed to provide specific recommendations or suggestions about identification of the cause of cough as well as the assessment and treatment of cough in this population. It was suggested that evaluation and management of cough in athletes should take into account many specific characteristics and special considerations for athletes, such as daily training, training environment, doping regulations, and frequent traveling. As each cause of cough might have a specific treatment, accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid using unnecessary medication.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclaimer</span></strong></p>
<p>American College of Chest Physician (CHEST) guidelines are intended for general information only, are not medical advice, and do not replace professional medical care and physician advice, which always should be sought for any medical condition. The complete disclaimer for this guideline can be accessed at <a href="http://www.chestnet.org/Guidelines-and-Resources" title="CHEST Web site">http://www.chestnet.org/Guidelines-and-Resources</a>. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strengths and Limitations</span></strong></p>
<p>Even though cough is a very commonly reported respiratory symptom in athletes, analysis of the literature stresses the paucity of data on cough in the athlete. The strengths of this analysis include the extensive review of &gt; 1,200 publications obtained according to the key words selected, the methodology used to perform the analysis, and its review by the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.</p>
<p>Its limitations are associated with the lack of high quality studies, the variable definition of an athlete among reports (resulting in a relatively heterogeneous group of athletes), the lack of specific analysis of cough among other types of respiratory symptoms, and the variable outcomes chosen to assess cough response to treatment. In addition, the number of patients enrolled in the studies was small.</p></div>
