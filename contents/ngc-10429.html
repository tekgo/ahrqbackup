Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of May 2014. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/gallstone.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text of the original guideline document for detailed information on each of the screening procedures.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key Points</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Patients presenting with upper abdominal pain or jaundice should be evaluated for gallstone-related disease.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The evaluation for gallstone-related disease is summarized in Table 1 of the original guideline document. The evaluation routinely includes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Complete physical exam </li>
    <li>Laboratory evaluation &ndash; complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, amylase/lipase </li>
    <li>Imaging &ndash; right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound </li>
</ol>
<p>In the vast majority of patients with acute cholecystitis, the diagnosis can be made based upon the history, physical findings, laboratory tests, and ultrasound (see Table 3 in the original guideline document for ultrasound findings that are suggestive of acute cholecystitis). In rare cases where the diagnosis of cholecystitis remains uncertain after this evaluation, additional imaging modalities may be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The treatment of gallstone-related diseases is summarized in Figure 1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><em>Biliary Colic</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Minimally symptomatic or with symptoms that resolve: Provide reassurance, education on avoidance of triggers (e.g., dietary fat). Provide direct referral to elective surgery (at University of Michigan, Priority Gallbladder Clinic for surgery within 2 weeks, see Appendix A in the original guideline document) <em>[II-C]</em>. </li>
    <li>Moderate to severe symptoms: Consult surgery. Perform non-urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during same visit <em>[II-C]</em>. Timing of surgery determined by patient preference and operating room availability. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Acute Cholecystitis</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Admit to Surgery. </li>
    <li>Initiate intravenous (IV) antibiotics (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). Perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 24 to 48 hours <em>[I-A]</em>.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>In patients without gallstones who have RUQ and/or epigastric pain and a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan showing delayed gallbladder filling or lack of gallbladder emptying, cholecystectomy should be recommended <em>[I-A]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Choledocholithiasis</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Evaluate for evidence of cholangitis. If suspected, treat as cholangitis (below). </li>
    <li>If no evidence of cholangitis, admit to surgery and prepare for cholecystectomy. </li>
    <li>Estimate the likelihood of choledocholithiasis (see Table 4 in the original guideline document).
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>For low likelihood, no additional evaluation is needed, and routine intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) is not recommended <em>[III-B]</em>. </li>
        <li>For intermediate risk, recommended approach is a one-stage procedure with laparoscopic cholecystectomy with IOC within 48 hours of admission (preferably within 24 hours) <em>[I-A]</em>. Alternate approaches might include preoperative imaging with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), especially if IOC will not be performed.
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>If IOC demonstrates a retained common bile duct (CBD) stone:
            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
                <li>Perform procedure to remove CBD stones during the same operation <em>[I-A]</em>, or </li>
                <li>Obtain gastroenterology consult within 24 hours after surgery for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). </li>
            </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="3">
        <li>For high risk patients, or those with documented choledocholithiasis, preoperative ERCP is often performed to clear the duct. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Cholangitis</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Admit to Medicine service. </li>
    <li>Initiate IV antibiotics, nil per os (nothing by mouth, NPO) (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>Obtain Gastroenterology consult. </li>
    <li>Classify severity of acute cholangitis (see Table 6 in the original guideline document).
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>If mild cholangitis with adequate response to medical therapy: ERCP within 72 hours. </li>
        <li>If moderate-severe and not responsive to medical therapy: ERCP within 24 hours. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>Consult surgery for laparoscopic cholecystectomy during same admission, after cholangitis resolves. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Gallstone Pancreatitis</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Evaluate for evidence of cholangitis. If suspected, treat as cholangitis (above). </li>
    <li>Classify severity of gallstone pancreatitis (see Table 7 in the original guideline document).
    <p><strong>Mild Gallstone Pancreatitis</strong></p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Admit to Surgery service. </li>
        <li>Perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy with IOC within 48 hours (preferably 24 hours) <em>[I-B]</em>. </li>
        <li>If IOC demonstrates a retained CBD stone:
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Surgical removal of CBD gallstone <em>[I-A ]</em>, or </li>
            <li>Gastroenterology consult for ERCP within 24 hours of surgery. </li>
        </ol>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The literature search for this guideline was conducted in Medline prospectively using major key words: biliary colic, cholecystitis, cholangitis, choledocholithiasis, gallstone pancreatitis. The search was limited to human adults population, and published in the English language between January 2009 and June 2013.</p>
<p>Additional key words included: clinical protocols, physician practice patterns, algorithms, consensus development conferences, practice guidelines, guidelines, outcomes and process assessment (health care); clinical trials, controlled clinical trials, multicenter studies, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, meta-analysis or meta-analyses; diagnosis, diagnostic use, sensitivity and specificity, false negative reactions, false positive reactions, likelihood functions, sensitivity, specificity; predictive value therapy, drug therapy, antibiotics, ultrasound, HIDA, CT, MRCP, cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasound, cholecystography, cholangiography, cholecystectomy, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube (PCT), biliary drainage tube, endoscopic retrograde, IOC.</p>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. The search was a single cycle.</p>
<p>Within the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 18 reviews were found using the strategy in the search strategies document.</p>
<p>The literature search revealed 10 established national guidelines specifically addressing gallstone-related diseases.</p></div>
