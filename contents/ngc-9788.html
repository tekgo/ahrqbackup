Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>In Patients with Symptomatic Intraparenchymal Neurocysticercosis, is Cysticidal Therapy More Effective Than No Therapy, and Does it Affect Long-term Seizure Outcome?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Based on imaging findings in 4 Class I studies (3 concordant, 1 underpowered study failing to show an effect) and a meta-analysis of 2 Class I and 4 Class II studies, albendazole (400 mg twice daily [BID] for adults or weight-based dosing for either adults or children) is probably safe and effective in reducing both the number of cysts and long-term seizure frequency in adults and children with neurocysticercosis. In most studies, corticosteroids were coadministered, in varying dosages, and this combination appears effective. Data are insufficient to indicate whether corticosteroids are necessary in this setting.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>The available studies have used different stratification methods for seizure analysis and different criteria for judging improvement in imaging. On the basis of the 3 Class I studies it appears albendazole plus corticosteroids decreases the number of active brain lesions relative to placebo and, on the basis of a meta-analysis of available data, decreases the number of patients with seizures, at modest cost. These findings appear to be consistent in adults and children.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Albendazole plus either dexamethasone or prednisolone should be considered for adults and children with neurocysticercosis, both to decrease the number of active lesions on brain imaging studies <strong>(Level B)</strong> and to reduce long-term seizure frequency <strong>(Level B)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In Patients with Symptomatic Intraparenchymal Neurocysticercosis, is Treatment with Corticosteroids More Effective Than No Treatment?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>On the basis of one Class I study showing no benefit radiologically and ambiguous benefit clinically and one Class II/IV study showing benefit, there is insufficient evidence to recommend steroid treatment alone for patients with solitary intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis granulomata.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>The effect of corticosteroid treatment alone in neurocysticercosis has not been widely studied. Most trials include a combination of cysticidal therapy and steroid treatment.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of steroid treatment alone in patients with intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis <strong>(Level U)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>When During the Course of Antiparasitic Treatment Should Steroids be Started?</strong></p>
<p>The Subcommittee found no studies to answer this question.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Efficacy of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) in Treating or Decreasing Occurrence of Subsequent Seizures Secondary to Intraparenchymal Neurocysticercosis, and What is the Optimal Time Course of AED Treatment for Seizures Secondary to Intraparenchymal Neurocysticercosis?</strong></p>
<p>The Subcommittee found no studies to answer this question.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>Given the well-established efficacy and safety of a broad range of AEDs and the frequency with which neurocysticercosis causes seizures, it is reasonable to treat these patients with AEDs at least until the active lesions have subsided.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Therapeutic Intervention</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences. The following are also required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for dropouts (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and crossovers with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias. </li>
    <li>For noninferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or noninferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the results of the study is based upon a per protocol analysis that takes into account dropouts or crossovers. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A randomized controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a&ndash;e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b&ndash;e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.**</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria including consensus or expert opinion.</p>
<p class="Note">*Note that numbers 1-3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class="Note">**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">* In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Because cysticercosis is quite prevalent in Latin America, a number of relevant studies have been published in the Spanish-language literature. Therefore, a comprehensive search was performed of both English- and Spanish-language articles (with the latter reviewed by 2 panel members who are fluent in Spanish) in Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1980 to 2008, using the search terms "neurocysticercosis," "cerebral cysticercosis," "brain cysticercosis," "antiparasitic agents," "antihelmintics," "cysticidal," "clinical trials," "research design," "antiseizure," "anticonvulsant," "antiepileptic," "albendazole," "praziquantel," "steroid," "corticosteroid," "anti-inflammatory agents," "hydrocortisone," "prednisone," "prednisolone," "dexamethasone," and "neurosurgery" (see appendix e-1 for complete search strategy [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The search identified 590 citations. An updated search of Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed in January 2012 and identified an additional 20 citations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>Medline was searched from January 2012 to January 2016 using the same search terms used for the 2013 guideline. Inclusion/exclusion criteria included RCTs, humans only, relevant to clinical questions; criteria used to screen search results were the same as described in the 2013 published guideline.</p></div>

<p>For this evidence-based guideline, the Guideline Development Subcommittee (GDS) asked the following question:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In patients with symptomatic intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis, is cysticidal therapy more effective than no therapy, and does it affect long-term seizure outcome? </li>
    <li>In patients with symptomatic intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis, is treatment with corticosteroids more effective than no treatment? </li>
    <li>When during the course of antiparasitic treatment should steroids be started? </li>
    <li>What is the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in treating or decreasing occurrence of subsequent seizures secondary to intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis, and what is the optimal time course of AED treatment for seizures secondary to intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis? </li>

<p>Recommendations are based on the strength of the evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) member who had expertise in neuro-infectious diseases conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists.</p></div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The AAN is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee before project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects.
