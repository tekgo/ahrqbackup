<p><strong>Structured Website Search</strong></p>
<p>A member of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team (project coordinator) searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines.</p>
<p>Guidelines were selected based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Focus on topic assessment and management of pain--in general (excluding condition specific entities e.g., musculoskeletal, cardiac or urology disease/disorders) for all types of pain (e.g., acute, persistent [chronic], nociceptive, neuropathic) which includes:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Assessment </li>
        <li>Prevention &amp; Management </li>
        <li>Education/Training programs </li>
        <li>Organizational Responsibilities </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Published between 2007 to 2012 </li>
    <li>Published in English, national and international in scope </li>
    <li>Accessible for retrieval </li>
</ul>
<p>See the search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for a list of websites searched.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Search</strong></p>
<p>RNAO expert panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify and submit potentially relevant guidelines. Guidelines submitted for consideration by RNAO expert panel members were integrated into the retrieved list of guidelines if they had not been identified by the on-line guideline search and met the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Review</strong></p>
<p>Members of the expert panel critically appraised 16 international guidelines using the <em>Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument</em> II. From this review, the eleven guidelines were selected to inform the review process.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Review Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>Concurrent with the review of existing guidelines, a search for recent literature relevant to the scope of the guideline was conducted with guidance from the RNAO's chair of the expert panel. The systematic literature search was conducted by a health sciences librarian. The search, limited to English-language articles published between 2006 and 2012, was applied to CINAHL, EMBASE, DARE, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ERIC, Joanna Briggs, and PsycINFO databases. The initial search for relevant studies returned 11,768 articles. Due to the volume of research, the inclusion criteria for study methodology was changed and limited to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, integrative reviews, randomized controlled trials and qualitative evidence syntheses. Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms, is available online at www.RNAO.ca. Two research associates (master's prepared nurses) independently assessed the eligibility of studies according to established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The RNAO Best Practice Guideline program manager working with the expert panel, resolved disagreements.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For this edition of the guideline, Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled an expert panel of health-care professionals comprised of members from the previous panel as well as other recommended individuals with particular expertise in this practice area. A systematic review of the evidence took into consideration the scope of the original guideline and subsequent revision supplement (2007). However, the ultimate focus of this review was on core competencies within the scope of nursing practice required for assessing and managing pain, which was supported by four clinical questions. It captured relevant literature and guidelines published between 2007 and 2012. These are the research questions that guided the systematic review:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What are the most effective nursing methods of assessment of pain in persons? </li>
    <li>What are the most effective nursing interventions to prevent and manage pain in persons (pharmacological; non-pharmacological, complementary/alternative)? </li>
    <li>What education is needed for nursing students on effective pain care? </li>
    <li>How do health-care organizations support optimal pain assessment and management practices? </li>
</ol>
<p>The RNAO expert panel's mandate was to review the original (2002) and revision supplement (2007) in light of the new evidence, specifically to ensure the validity, appropriateness and safety of the guideline recommendations. This edition is the result of the expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence to update the guideline recommendations and supporting evidence from the 2007 revision supplement.</p>
<p>The comprehensive data tables and summary were provided to all panel members. In September 2012, the RNAO expert panel convened to revise and achieve consensus on guideline recommendations and discussion of evidence.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Many opioid-na&iuml;ve patients will develop nausea or vomiting when starting opioids, tolerance usually occurs within 5 to 10 days. Patients commencing an opioid for moderate to severe pain should have access to an antiemetic to be taken if required. </li>
    <li>The majority of patients taking opioids for moderate to severe pain will develop constipation. Little or no tolerance develops. The commonest prophylactic treatment for preventing opioid-induced constipation is a combination of stimulant (senna or bisocodyl) and osmotic laxatives (lactulose or PEG 3350). </li>
    <li>Sedation can be a common adverse effect when initiating opioids and when increasing opioid doses for pain management. Sedation generally precedes significant respiratory depression. Gradual increase in sedation is an early warning sign and a particularly sensitive indicator of impending respiratory depression in the context of opioid administration. </li>

    <li>These guidelines are not binding on nurses or the organizations that employ them. The use of these guidelines should be flexible, and based on individual needs and local circumstances. They neither constitute a liability nor discharge from liability. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the contents at the time of publication, neither the authors nor the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) give any guarantee as to the accuracy of the information contained in them nor accept any liability, with respect to loss, damage, injury or expense arising from any such errors or omission in the contents of this work. </li>
    <li>This nursing best practice guideline is a comprehensive document, providing resources for evidence-based nursing practice and should be considered a tool, or template, intended to enhance decision making for individualized care. The guideline is intended to be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of individual organizations or practice settings and the needs and wishes of the person (throughout this document, the word "person" is used to refer to clients, or patients; that is, the person, their family and caregivers being cared for by the interprofessional team). In addition, the guideline provides an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care. </li>
    <li>Nurses, other health-care professionals and administrators who lead and facilitate practice changes will find this document invaluable for developing policies, procedures, protocols, educational programs and assessments, interventions and documentation tools. Nurses in direct care will benefit from reviewing the recommendations and the evidence that supports them.

Description of Implementation Strategy

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Toolkit: Implementing Clinical Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Best practice guidelines can only be successfully implemented if planning, resources, organizational and administrative supports are adequate and there is appropriate facilitation. In this light, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO), through a panel of nurses, researchers and administrators, has developed the <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> (2012). The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on available evidence, theoretical perspectives and consensus. The RNAO recommends the <em>Toolkit</em> for guiding the implementation of any clinical practice guideline in a health-care organization.</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> provides step-by-step directions to individuals and groups involved in planning, coordinating and facilitating the guideline implementation. These steps reflect a process that is dynamic and iterative rather than linear. Therefore, at each phase preparation for the next phases and reflection on the previous phase is essential. Specifically, the <em>Toolkit</em> addresses the following key steps, as illustrated in the "Knowledge to Action" framework in implementing a guideline:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Identify problem: identify, review, select knowledge (Best Practice Guideline). </li>
    <li>Adapt knowledge to local context:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Assess barriers and facilitators to knowledge use </li>
        <li>Identify resources </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Select, tailor and implement interventions. </li>
    <li>Monitor knowledge use. </li>

<p>Implementing guidelines in practice that result in successful practice changes and positive clinical impact is a complex undertaking. The <em>Toolkit</em> is one key resource for managing this process. The <em>Toolkit</em> can be downloaded at <a href="http://rnao.ca/bpg" title="RNAO Web site">http://rnao.ca/bpg</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evaluating and Monitoring This Guideline</strong></p>
<p>As you implement the recommendations in this guideline, the RNAO asks you to consider how you will monitor and evaluate its implementation and impact.</p>
<p>Table 7 in the original guideline document is based on a framework outlined in the <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines</em> (2012) and illustrates some specific indicators for monitoring and evaluation of this guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Strategies</strong></p>
<p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multifaceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. Our <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines (2012)</em> provides an evidence-informed process for doing that.</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health care is more likely when:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guideline is relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses a knowledge-to-action model that depicts the process of choosing a guideline in the centre triangle, and follows detailed step-by-step directions for implementing recommendations locally.</p></div>
