<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of heart failure patients age 18 years and older who have comprehensive patient education and follow-up care.</p>
<p>Heart failure is a major health problem in the United States (U.S.), and the incidence of the disease is increasing. The overall estimated 2004 prevalence of heart failure in adults age 20 and older in the U.S. was 5.2 million, with it being equally distributed among men and women.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoking increases the incidence of congestive heart failure. As heart failure continues to increase in prevalence in the U.S., there is a need to look at how to prevent decompensation of previously stable heart failure patients. Several precipitating factors have been suggested in the relapse of heart failure, and one of them includes cigarette smoking. </p>
<p>Research on the participants in the Study of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) showed that current cigarette smoking increased mortality and hospitalization compared to ex-smokers and those who never smoked. Quitting smoking is associated with a significant decrease in risk of all-cause mortality among patients with coronary heart disease. In fact, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, research on the SOLVD participants showed that quitting smoking substantially decreases morbidity and mortality within two years.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In age 20 to 39, the incidence of heart failure is 0.3% of the population in men and 0.2% of the population in women. In the ages 40s and 50s, the incidence is 2% in men and 1.5% in women. In the 60 to 79 age group, the incidence is 7.2% in men and 5.2% in women. However, once reaching age 80, the incidence of heart failure is higher in women, with 11.6% of men and 12.4% of women. </li>
    <li>Seventy-five percent of heart failure cases have antecedent hypertension in that the lifetime risk for heart failure doubles for people with blood pressure greater than 160/90 versus those with blood pressure less than 140/90. A community-based cohort study conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota, showed that the incidence of heart failure (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD9]-428) has not declined during the past two decades, but survival after onset has increased overall, with less improvement among women and elderly persons. </li>
