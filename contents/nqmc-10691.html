<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Bony manifestations of myeloma, in the form of diffuse osteopenia and/or osteolytic lesions, develop in 85% of patients. Related complications are the major cause of limitations in quality of life and performance status in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). A large, double-blind, randomized trial has shown that monthly use of intravenous pamidronate (a bisphosphonate) can decrease pain and bone-related complications, improve performance status, and, importantly, preserve quality of life in patients with Durie-Salmon stage III MM and at least one lytic lesion. </p>
<p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Multiple Myeloma recommend bisphosphonates for all patients receiving myeloma therapy for symptomatic disease regardless of documented bone disease (NCCN, 2015).</p>
<p>In patients with smoldering or stage I MM, according to the NCCN Panel, bisphosphonates may be considered but preferably in a clinical trial (NCCN, 2015).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) in collaboration with the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conducted a measure testing project from May to September of 2010 to ensure that all four hematology measures were feasible to implement and reliable. Two testing projects were conducted utilizing patient records in the electronic health record (EHR) environment and claims data. The two sites were located in different United States (U.S.) states and were selected based on their ability to meet the measure testing site criteria. Site 1 was a small-scale hematology group practice and Site 2 was a large-scale multi-specialty group clinic; both sites were in an urban setting.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Measures were tested using information stored in the EHR environment and claims data from both sites. Inter-rater reliability was performed in the EHR environment. Parallel forms reliability was performed reviewing Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) claims information compared to a manual review of the patient chart.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing Results</strong></p>
<p>Overall the measures were found to be reliable. Inter-rate reliability testing was conducted and Kappa statistics were calculated for the measures, which demonstrated almost perfect agreement.</p>
<p>One of the two measure testing sites participated in the PQRS program and submitted claims comparison on two measures. PQRS claims were reviewed and information was verified in the record review for a significant portion of these charts.</p></div>
