<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Support (verbatim) from The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines</em>:<br />
Due to the risk of hepatitis B reactivation, the [NCCN] panel has included hepatitis B testing (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb]) as part of essential work-up prior to initiation of treatment in all patients who will receive anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-based regimens. Furthermore, hepatitis B reactivation has been reported with chemotherapy alone and testing should be considered in anyone with a risk factor (e.g., blood transfusion, intravenous [IV] drug abuse) or if from a region with a non-negligible prevalence of hepatitis B infection. </p>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported to occur in patients treated with chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy agents. HBV carriers with lymphoid malignancies have a high risk of HBV reactivation and disease, especially those treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., rituximab, ofatumumab). Cases of liver failure and death associated with HBV reactivation have occurred in patients receiving rituximab-containing regimens. The panel recommends HBsAg and HBcAb testing for all patients planned for treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing regimens (NCCN, 2015).</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure
</h2>
<div class='field field_picklist-choice'>
<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A clinical practice guideline or other peer-reviewed synthesis of the clinical research evidence
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
One or more research studies published in a National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexed, peer-reviewed journal
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Statement (verbatim) from American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) on gap:</em><br />
An ASCO provisional clinical opinion (PCO) offers timely clinical direction to ASCO's membership following publication or presentation of potentially practice-changing information. This PCO addresses recommendations for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection screening in patients receiving cytotoxic or immunosuppressive chemotherapy for treatment of malignant diseases. </p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued Recommendations for Identification and Public Health Management of Persons with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection, recommending screening for hepatitis B infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], antihepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc], and antibodies to HBsAg [anti-HBs]) for "persons receiving cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., chemotherapy for malignant diseases&hellip;)." </p>
<p>The evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefits and harms of routine screening for chronic HBV infection in individuals with cancer who are about to receive cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy or who are already receiving therapy. Individuals with cancer who undergo certain cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapies and have HBV infection or prior exposure to HBV may be at elevated risk of liver failure from HBV reactivation. As such, HBV screening requires clinical judgment. Physicians may consider screening patients belonging to groups at heightened risk for chronic HBV infection (such as those with lymphoproliferative diseases &ndash; qualification added by the American Society of Hematology [ASH] Lymphoma Task Force) or if highly immunosuppressive therapy is planned (such as corticosteroids, purine analogues, rituximab or wide field radiation &ndash; note added by ASH Lymphoma Task Force). Highly immunosuppressive treatments include, but are not limited to, hematopoietic cell transplantation and regimens including rituximab. Screening based on a high risk of prior HBV exposure or risk of reactivation due to planned therapeutic regimens should include testing for HBsAg as a serologic marker for HBV infection. </p>
<p>In some populations, testing for anti-HBc should also be considered. There is no evidence to support serologic testing for anti-HBs in this context. When evidence for chronic HBV infection is found, antiviral therapy before and throughout the course of chemotherapy may be considered to reduce the risk of HBV reactivation, although evidence from controlled trials of this approach is limited. Screening and/or treating HBV infection should not delay the initiation of chemotherapy (Artz et al., 2010).</p>
<p><em>Statement from ASH Lymphoma Task Force on gap</em>:<br />
New guidelines on hepatitis B testing were released from the CDC in September 2008. Concerns were raised in the oncology community regarding the degree of change and associated costs and potential for risk without proven benefits. In response, ASCO released a provisional clinical opinion in July 2010 specifying the need for hepatitis B testing in patients being considered for rituximab and hematopoetic cell transplant. As this clarification in relatively new, we believe a gap in care continues.</p>
<p>This measure has been in use for the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification Performance Improvement Module since July 2013. Performance over the first 10 months (through May 2014) among this highly select group of hematologists is 69%. We believe performance among all hematologists would be somewhat lower. This gap remains significant and identifies a deficiency that poses serious risk of catastrophic liver failure for patients if not appropriately prophylaxed. </p></div>
