<h2>Brief Abstract
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the proportion of children whose parents were assessed by a health provider on one or more of the recommended psychosocial well-being topics, including depression, emotional support, changes or stressors in the home, and how parenting is working.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Recommended developmental services, as set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, include family psychosocial assessment and follow-up, which consists of maternal depression; mental health of parents; smoking, alcohol and drug use; presences of adequate economic, social, and emotional supports; guns; family violence; and other safety issues.  In order to gauge the quality of recommended care provided, this type of information must be collected from the parent in order to identify the level at which providers discuss these issues with parents.  Previous studies have shown that parents are willing  to discuss such sensitive topics with providers.</p>

<p>Few standardized quality measures are available that provide specific information about preventive health care for young children, especially on aspects of care for which parents and families are a reliable source of information about the quality of their child's health care.  A majority of the measures currently used provide information about whether children come in for well-child visits (access to care measures) or are based on medical chart reviews which are not accurate for the specific level of information obtained in the Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>1999: Pilot Testing by Mail in Three Health Plans</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the Promoting Healthy Development Survey (PHDS) quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability).  Findings are displayed in the article, "Assessing Health System Provision of Well-child Cared: the Promoting Healthy Development Survey."</li>
<li>In-depth cognitive testing of the draft survey was conducted with 15 families representing a range of socioeconomic and demographic groups, as well as different types of health insurance coverage, age of child, age and sex or parent, and number of children in family.  Survey design and formatting was finalized with input from a group of experts and family representatives.  Reliability assessments indicated the PHDS to be written at the 8th-9th grade reading level.  Cognitive testing confirmed the readability of the PHDS for people across a range of educational levels.</li>

<p><strong>2000-2001: Implementation by Telephone Three-State Medicaid Clients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cognitive interviews were conducted with 20 parents of children 3 to 48 months old who were enrolled in Medicaid.  Five of these interviews were conducted in-person; the remaining 15 were conducted over the telephone in order to assess the response burden and cognitive ease of the PHDS when using a telephone administration.  Using behavior coding methods, for each item in the PHDS, instances where the respondent required clarification or did not appropriately answer an item were noted.  Also, items where the interviewer had difficulty asking the question without edits to the wording were noted.  Survey modifications were made based on findings in order to improve the reliability, validity and cognitive ease of the PHDS items.</li>
<li>The PHDS was administered by telephone to parents in 3 state Medicaid programs.</li>
<li>Psychometric analyses demonstrated that the PHDS quality measure scales have strong construct validity and internal consistency (reliability). These findings are displayed in the report, "Partnering with Parents to Promote the Healthy Development of Young Children Enrolled in Medicaid."</li>
