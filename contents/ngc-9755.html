<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Awake Asymptomatic Patient</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence was previously reported on this topic. The current updated review identified additional <strong>Class I</strong> evidence supporting a <strong>Level I</strong> recommendation that in the awake, asymptomatic patient who is without neck pain or tenderness, is neurologically intact without an injury detracting from an accurate evaluation, and who is able to complete a functional range of motion examination, radiographic evaluation of the cervical spine is not recommended. The discontinuance of cervical immobilization in this patient population is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Awake Symptomatic Patient</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence was previously reported on this topic. This current updated review identified additional <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence that alters the previous <strong>Level I</strong> recommendation. High-quality CT imaging of the cervical spine in the symptomatic trauma patient has been proven to be more accurate than CSRs with higher sensitivity and specificity for injury following blunt trauma. If high-quality CT is available, 3-view CSRs are not necessary. If high quality CT is not available, a 3-view cervical spine series (anteroposterior, lateral, and odontoid views) remains a <strong>Level I</strong> recommendation.</p>
<p>The question of "what to do?" if anything for the awake patient with neck pain or tenderness and normal high-quality CT or 3-view CSR remains less clear. Only lower level medical evidence is available to guide treatment decisions for these patients. The current literature offers less robust medical evidence in support of the 3 following strategies in the awake but symptomatic patient: (1) continue cervical immobilization until asymptomatic, (2) discontinue cervical immobilization following either normal and adequate dynamic flexion/extension radiographs, or a normal MRI study obtained within 48 hours of injury, or (3) discontinue immobilization at the discretion of the treating physician. Several studies favor the use of MRI <strong>(Level II)</strong> over dynamic radiographs <strong>(Level III)</strong> in further study of these patients, but may not be feasible or indicated in all situations.</p>
<p><strong>Obtunded or Unevaluable Patient</strong></p>
<p>A large number of studies have been produced since the previous guideline publication on imaging the obtunded or unevaluable patient in order to clear the cervical spine without the benefit of the clinical examination. The current <strong>Level I</strong> recommendation, based on <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence, is that high-quality CT imaging is recommended as the initial imaging study of choice. If high-quality CT imaging is available, routine 3-view CSRs are not necessary, similar to the <strong>Level I</strong> recommendations in the other categories. If high-quality CT is not available, a 3-view cervical spine series (anteroposterior, lateral, and odontoid views) is recommended. The plain cervical spine x-ray studies should be supplemented with CT (when it becomes available) if necessary, to further define areas that are suspicious or not well-visualized on the plain cervical x-rays.</p>
<p>The most controversial issue in the obtunded/unevaluable patient group is the recommendation on the discontinuation of immobilization. The current recommendation is that in the obtunded or unevaluable patient who has normal high-quality CT imaging or a normal 3-view cervical spine series, 1 of the following strategies be considered: (1) continue cervical immobilization until asymptomatic, (2) discontinue cervical immobilization following a normal MRI study obtained within 48 hours of injury, or (3) discontinue immobilization at the discretion of the treating physician. MRI appears to be the imaging modality of choice in this situation based on limited and conflicting <strong>Class II</strong> and<strong> Class III</strong> medical evidence. <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence suggests that the routine use of dynamic imaging is of marginal benefit and is not recommended. <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence suggests that the decisions for the subsequent patient management of the obtunded/unevaluable patient including whether or not to obtain an MRI study on individual patients involve physicians trained in the diagnosis and management of spinal injuries.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A computerized search of the database of the National Library of Medicine (PubMed) between 1966 and 2011 was conducted using the search terms "spinal cord injury" or "spinal fractures" or "spinal injuries" and resulted in 30,238 references. A similar search was conducted with search terms "clearance" or "diagnosis" or "radiographs" that provided 23,005,577 citations. Combining these 2 searches using "and" gave 6,399 references. The search was limited to the English language and human subjects. This resulted in 4,942 citations. The titles and abstracts of these references were reviewed. Studies that investigated the diagnostic potential of an imaging technique to assess cervical trauma were selected. Additional articles were obtained from the bibliographies of selected manuscripts. Thirty-two manuscripts were identified that provided either direct or supporting medical evidence on the diagnostic potential of cervical spinal imaging modalities. In general, priority was given to large (&gt;100 patients) prospective studies, meta-analyses, and articles published since the previous iteration of this guideline.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Selected articles were carefully reviewed by the authors. Evidentiary tables were created (refer to Tables 3 to 5 in the original guideline document) that reflected the strengths and weaknesses of each article.</p>
<p>On occasion, the assessed quality of the study design was so contentious and the conclusions so uncertain that the guideline authors assigned a lower medical evidence classification than might have been expected without such a detailed review. In every way, adherence to the Institute of Medicine's criteria for searching, assembling, evaluating, and weighing the available medical evidence and linking it to the strength of the recommendations presented in this document was carried out.</p>
<p>Articles that did not achieve immediate consensus among the author group were discussed extensively until a consensus was reached. Very few contributions required extensive discussion. Most articles were easily designated as containing Class I, II, or III medical evidence using the criteria set forth by the author group at the initiation of the literature evaluation process (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
