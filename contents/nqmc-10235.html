<h2>Brief Abstract

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the number of computed tomography (CT) exams performed at the facility that were submitted to the Dose Index Registry. </p>
<p>Measure calculated at facility/group level (National Provider Identifier [NPI]/Taxpayer Identification Number [TIN]) with rate assigned to all physicians within the facility/group who interpret CTs.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The determination of ionizing radiation dose to a living human is very complex and poses many challenges for referring physicians, radiologists, radiologic technologists, medical physicists, equipment vendors, regulators, and patients. To determine the absorbed radiation dose, the initial x-ray beam exposure and the absorption in each organ must be known. It is the latter quantity that complicates this determination. This absorption is dependent on the amount and properties of each tissue encountered by the x-ray beam, and these parameters vary widely among patients. The situation is further complicated because it is not practical to insert radiation detectors into each organ of every patient. It is important to understand that the reported numerical values for individual radiation doses may vary by factors of 5 to 10 depending on individual patients and the manner of image acquisition. </p>
<p>There are many challenges in dose monitoring, including collection of accurate data with minimal effort on the part of the facility, standardization of procedure names so that benchmarks can be applied appropriately, and adjustment for patient sizes. Dose registries would enable facilities to compare their radiation doses to those delivered in other facilities for the same exam, and such comparisons over time could assist in optimizing patient radiation doses for medical imaging. The goals of tracking imaging exams and the associated radiation exposure include: 1) providing information at the point-of-care for the referring practitioner (i.e., supporting justification); 2) promoting development and use of diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) (i.e., supporting optimization); 3) providing information for assessment of radiation risks; and 4) establishing a tool for use in research and epidemiology.</p>
<p>Dose index monitoring is still at an early stage and there are no clear benchmarks for most exams. In addition, computed tomography (CT) scanners have the capability to alert users regarding potentially high radiation exposures but facilities do not have adequate guidance on where to set notification levels for acceptable exposure for any particular protocol. The primary goal of this measure at this point is to facilitate the development of infrastructure for radiation dose monitoring at the facility-level through participation in the registry. Increasing participation in the registry will enable the development of benchmarks and guidance for a broad range of exams. The goal of the Dose Index Registry participation measure is to improve patient safety by helping facilities adjust their imaging protocols to obtain diagnostic images using the lowest reasonable dose. There is likely to be quality improvement simply with participation but the larger benefit in the role of an attestation measure is supporting the development of an infrastructure to provide richer means of dose index monitoring and implementation of safety checks against high exposure levels. </p>
<p>This measure is calculated at the facility level because registry participation and protocol optimization are the combined effort of physicians, medical physicists and technologists in the practice, and change needs to be driven by the interpreting physicians as a team.</p></div>

<p>The ACR recognizes the importance of thorough testing all of its measures and encourages ongoing robust testing of the ACR National Radiology Data Registry measurement set for feasibility and reliability by organizations or individuals positioned to do so. The ACR will welcome the opportunity to promote such testing of these measures and to ensure that any results available from testing are used to refine the measures on an ongoing basis. Since these measures are in use for quality improvement and reporting, we can support data analysis of registry data to perform the testing, such as evaluation of gaps for validity testing, and signal-to-noise estimation for reliability testing. </p></div>
