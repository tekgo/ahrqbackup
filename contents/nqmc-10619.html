Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the number of acute inpatient stays during the measurement year that were followed by an unplanned acute readmission for any diagnosis within 30 days and the predicted probability of an acute readmission, for members 18 years of age and older. Data are reported in the following categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Count of Index Hospital Stays (IHS) (denominator) </li>
    <li>Count of 30-day readmissions (numerator) </li>
    <li>Average adjusted probability of readmission </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: For commercial, report only members 18 to 64 years of age. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Discharge from a hospital is a critical transition point in a patient's care. Poor care coordination at discharge can lead to adverse events for patients and avoidable rehospitalization. Hospitalization readmissions may indicate poor care or missed opportunities to coordinate care better. Research shows that specific hospital-based initiatives to improve communication with beneficiaries and their caregivers, coordinate care after discharge and improve the quality of care during the initial admission can avert many readmissions. </p>
<p>There is extensive evidence about adverse events in patients, and this measure aims to distinguish readmissions from complications of care and pre-existing comorbidities (Gallagher, Cen, &amp; Hannan, 2005). </p>
<p>Potentially preventable readmissions are defined as readmissions that are directly tied to conditions that could have been avoided in the inpatient setting. While not all preventable readmissions can be avoided, most potentially preventable readmissions can be prevented if the best quality of care is rendered and clinicians are using current standards of care. </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A "readmission" occurs when a patient is discharged from the hospital and then admitted back into the hospital within a short period of time. A high rate of patient readmissions may indicate inadequate quality of care in the hospital and/or a lack of appropriate post-discharge planning and coordination. Unplanned rehospitalizations are associated with increased mortality and higher health care costs, and are often avoidable. </li>
    <li>Approximately 3.3 million adults are readmitted to a hospital within 30 days in the United States (U.S.), contributing to $41.3 billion in hospital costs (Hines et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>Medicare beneficiaries account for the largest proportion of readmissions (55.9 percent) and costs associated with readmissions (58.2 percent) (Hines et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>An estimated 23 percent of readmissions are preventable (van Walraven, Jennings, &amp; Forster, 2012). </li>
    <li>The rate of readmission can vary almost two-fold across different areas of the U.S., suggesting room for improvement in some regions (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [RWJF], 2013). </li>
    <li>In one study, more than half of patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge had no evidence of any follow-up visit between discharge and readmission (Jencks, Williams, &amp; Coleman, 2009). </li>
    <li>Post-discharge follow-up programs can reduce readmissions by 22 to 30 percent (Melton et al., 2012; Novak et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Unplanned readmissions can be prevented by standardizing and improving coordination of care after discharge and increasing support for patient self-management (Boutwell et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
