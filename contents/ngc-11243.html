<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based</strong>, <strong>Formal consensus</strong>, <strong>Informal consensus</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>After a histopathologic confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis, what initial assessment is recommended before initiating any therapy for potentially curable pancreatic cancer?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: A multiphase computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis using a pancreatic protocol or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed for all patients with pancreatic cancer to assess the anatomic relationships of the primary tumor and to assess for the presence of intra-abdominal metastases. Endoscopic ultrasonography and/or diagnostic laparoscopy may be used as supplemental studies and to facilitate acquisition of a biopsy specimen. A chest x-ray may be performed to stage the thorax. Other staging studies should be performed only as dictated by symptom burden. A serum level of cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 and baseline standard laboratory studies should be assayed (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: The baseline performance status, symptom burden, and comorbidity profile of a patient diagnosed with potentially curable pancreatic cancer should be evaluated carefully (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: The goals of care (including a discussion of advance directives), patient preferences, and support systems should be discussed with every patient diagnosed with potentially curable pancreatic cancer and his or her caregivers (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.4</em>: Multidisciplinary collaboration to formulate treatment and care plans and disease management for patients with potentially curable pancreatic cancer should be the standard of care (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.5</em>: Every person with pancreatic cancer should be offered information about clinical trials, including therapeutic trials in all lines of treatment, as well as palliative care, biorepository/biomarker, and observational studies (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Which patients with potentially curable pancreatic cancer should be offered a potentially curative strategy with primary tumor resection?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: Primary surgical resection of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes is recommended for patients with potentially curable pancreatic cancer who meet all of the following criteria: no clinical evidence for metastatic disease, a performance status and comorbidity profile appropriate for a major abdominal operation, no radiographic interface between primary tumor and mesenteric vasculature on high-definition cross-sectional imaging, and an acceptable CA 19-9 level (in absence of jaundice) suggestive of localized disease (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Which patients with potentially curable pancreatic cancer should be offered a potentially curative strategy with preoperative therapy, followed by planned primary tumor resection?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em>: Preoperative therapy is recommended for patients with pancreatic cancer who meet any of the following criteria: radiographic findings suspicious but not diagnostic for extrapancreatic disease, a performance status or comorbidity profile not currently appropriate (but potentially reversible) for a major abdominal operation, a radiographic interface between primary tumor and mesenteric vasculature on cross-sectional imaging that does not meet the criteria in Clinical Question 2, or a CA 19-9 level (in absence of jaundice) suggestive of disseminated disease (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em>: Preoperative therapy should be offered as an alternative treatment strategy for any patient who meets all criteria in Recommendation 2.1 (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3</em>: If preoperative therapy is administered, a complete restaging evaluation (see Clinical Question 1) is recommended after completion of treatment and before final surgical planning (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the appropriate adjuvant regimen for patients with pancreatic cancer who have undergone an R0 or R1 resection of their primary tumor?</strong></p>
<p><em>Updated Recommendation 4.1</em>: All patients with resected pancreatic cancer who did not receive preoperative therapy should be offered 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy in the absence of medical or surgical contraindications. The doublet regimen of gemcitabine and capecitabine is a new option; alternatively, monotherapy with gemcitabine alone or fluorouracil plus folinic acid can be offered if there are concerns about toxicity or tolerance. Adjuvant treatment should be initiated within 8 weeks of surgical resection, assuming complete recovery (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.2</em>: Adjuvant chemoradiation may be offered to patients who did not receive preoperative therapy and present after resection with microscopically positive margins (R1) and/or node-positive disease after completion of 4 to 6 months of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy as outlined in Recommendation 4.1. There is clinical equipoise regarding the benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy in this setting pending results of an ongoing international randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Type: Informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.3</em>: For patients with pancreatic cancer who received preoperative therapy, there are no RCT data to guide the administration of postoperative therapy. The panel recommends that a total of 6 months of adjuvant therapy (including preoperative regimen) be offered based on extrapolation from adjuvant therapy trials (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>When should palliative care services be initiated for patients with pancreatic cancer that is potentially curable by surgery?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.1</em>: Patients with potentially curable pancreatic cancer should have a full assessment of symptom burden, psychological status, and social supports as early as possible, preferably at the first visit. In some instances, this may indicate a need for a formal palliative care consult and services (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.2</em>: Patients who have undergone pancreatectomy for potentially curable pancreatic cancer should receive ongoing supportive care for symptom burden that may result from the surgery and (preoperative and/or adjuvant) chemotherapy (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the recommended frequency of follow-up care or surveillance for patients with potentially curable pancreatic cancer after the administration of potentially curative multimodality therapy that includes resection?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6.1</em>: In the absence of RCT evidence, the panel recommends that patients who have completed treatment of potentially curable pancreatic cancer and have no evidence of disease be monitored for recovery of treatment-related toxicities and recurrence. Visits may be offered at 3- to 6-month intervals; the role of serial cross-sectional imaging, the extent to which surveillance intervals should be prolonged over time, and the duration of recommended surveillance are all undefined (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations were developed by the multidisciplinary Expert Panel using a systematic review of articles (April 2002 to June 2015) of phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Other peer-reviewed articles were used to inform the recommendations on patient and clinician communication, health disparities, and multiple chronic conditions (MCCs), as well as the section on cost implication. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence on the basis of the following criteria: included patients with potentially curable (resectable or borderline resectable) pancreatic cancer; involved phase III RCTs of preoperative (neoadjuvant) or adjuvant chemotherapy alone and/or with chemoradiotherapy and/or compared with a control arm; and written in English, with human patients.</p>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; or published in a non-English language.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Computerized literature searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. The searches of the English-language literature published from January 2000 to June 2015 combined pancreatic neoplasm terms and follow-up-related terms and MeSH headings. Results of the databases searches were supplemented with hand searching of the bibliographies of systematic reviews and selected seminal articles, and contributions from Expert Panel members' personal files.</p>
<p>Details of the literature search strategy are provided in Data Supplement 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). A Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) Diagram that reports the results of the literature search is available in Data Supplement 4 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Addendum</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guideline Update Process</strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) uses a signals approach to facilitate guideline updating. This approach is intended to identify new, potentially practice-changing data&mdash;signals&mdash;that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on routine literature searching and the expertise of ASCO guideline panel members to identify signals. The methodology supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provides additional information about the signals approach.</p>
<p>The recently published results of a randomized phase III study prompted an update of this guideline. The high quality of the reported evidence and the potential for its clinical impact prompted the Expert Panel to revise one of the guideline recommendations.</p></div>

<p>There were only nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for some of the guideline recommendations. Twelve systematic reviews or meta-analyses of various rigor and quality were obtained, but none were deemed suitable as the basis for recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by two American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewers in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by two staff reviewers and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in Data Supplements 1 and 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Study Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Study design aspects related to individual study quality, strength of evidence, strength of recommendations, and risk of bias were assessed and are provided in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The study quality was particularly high for this group of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed with factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, and so on, generally indicating a low potential risk of bias for most of the identified evidence. Follow-up times varied between studies, decreasing the comparability of the results. Refer to the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields for more extensive definitions of ratings of evidence quality, strength of recommendations, and overall potential risk of bias.</p>

<p><strong>Panel Composition</strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, pathology, community oncology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel met via webinar on several occasions and corresponded frequently through e-mail; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software&trade;. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p>
<p>Some recommendations are based on informal consensus by the panel because there was no randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Addendum</span></strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel used e-mail to consider the new evidence published in the October 2016 update (Appendix Table A1, online only).</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost Implications</span></strong></p>
<p>There are limited cost-effectiveness analyses regarding the various treatment modalities used in the multidisciplinary management of potentially curable pancreatic cancer. However, the available data seem to support the recommendations outlined in the guideline. A study from the United Kingdom evaluated the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic laparoscopy for assessing resectability in pancreatic and periampullary cancer and found that diagnostic laparoscopy before laparotomy in patients with potentially curable pancreatic cancer seems to be cost effective in pancreatic cancer (but not in periampullary cancer). A similar United States (U.S.) analysis found that routine diagnostic laparoscopy was the preferred strategy, allowing for cost reductions of $10,695 per quality-adjusted life-month (QALM) in patients receiving primary surgery and $4,158 per QALM in patients receiving preoperative therapy. A recent article evaluated a decision analytic model to compare neoadjuvant therapy with primary surgery in this population, estimating costs using Medicare payment (2011 U.S. dollars). Survival was reported in QALMs. The authors found that the surgery-first approach cost $46,830 and yielded survival of 8.7 QALMs, whereas the neoadjuvant chemoradiation approach cost $36,583 and yielded survival of 18.8 QALMs. Cost-effectiveness was driven primarily because the neoadjuvant approach identified patients with early metastases or poor performance status, who were spared an ineffective or prohibitively morbid operation. A similar prior analysis by the same group also found that incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were significantly lower for high-performing centers ($5,991 per QALM) than for low-performing centers ($9,144 per QALM), supporting the recommendation for multidisciplinary approach in high-volume centers. Finally, a Markov model evaluated various surveillance approaches in the postoperative setting. Not receiving scheduled surveillance was associated with a postoperative overall survival (OS) of 24.6 months and a cost of $3,837 per patient. Clinical evaluation and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 assay every 6 months until recurrence was associated with an OS of 32.8 months and a cost of $7,496 per patient. Additional routine imaging every 6 months incrementally increased total cost by $3,465 without increasing OS. The authors concluded that increasing the frequency and intensity of postoperative surveillance of patients after curative therapy for pancreatic cancer beyond clinical evaluation and CA 19-9 testing every 6 months increases cost but confers no clinically significant survival benefit.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Improved identification of patients with pancreatic cancer who should be offered potentially curative therapy or should receive preoperative and/or adjuvant treatment </li>
    <li>Adjuvant therapy improves survival and decreases recurrence compared with surgery alone, and the administration of chemotherapy in the postoperative setting is supported by randomized phase III data. </li>
    <li>Among patients with potentially curable pancreatic cancer, baseline performance status and a comorbidity profile should be evaluated carefully because both have implications with regard to a patient's ability to tolerate therapy. Performance status has been consistently identified as a prognostic factor for patients with pancreatic cancer. Measurement of constructs such as frailty and performance status is important, and such measurements may be used to predict chemotherapy toxicity and surgical risk. Geriatric assessment can identify underlying issues that increase the risk of adverse outcomes of older patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the "Literature review and analysis" and "Clinical interpretation" sections of the original guideline document for detailed discussions of the potential benefits and harms of each recommendation.</p>
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Operative mortality of patients age &ge;80 years is higher than in younger patients (age 65 to 69 years), and many are transferred to extended care facilities after surgery. </li>
    <li>Even on clinical trials, which enroll highly selected people with potentially curable pancreatic cancer, tolerance and completion of adjuvant therapy is challenging as a result of adverse events and toxicities. In patients undergoing surgery with curative intent, a high Charlson age-comorbidity index increased the risk of death significantly (score of &ge;6 increased by threefold the odds of death) within the first year after surgery. In another study of resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma that involved multivariable analysis of 326 patients, elevated blood urea nitrogen (hazard ratio [HR], 4.34; P&lt;.001) and a Khorana score &ge;3 (HR, 2.31; <em>P</em>=.039) were associated with early mortality. </li>
    <li>Cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 can be falsely elevated in the presence of obstructive jaundice, a common presentation for pancreatic cancer. Therefore, levels should be repeated after resolution of hyperbilirubinemia. </li>
    <li>Treatment-related toxicity. A recent systematic review showed that chemoradiation plus gemcitabine was ranked the most toxic, with significantly higher hematologic toxic effects than chemoradiation plus fluorouracil (odds ratio [OR], 13.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 169.36). The authors concluded that adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil or gemcitabine is optimal; adjuvant chemoradiation is less effective and more toxic. </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the <a href="http://www.asco.org/" title="ASCO Web site">ASCO Web site</a> and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (<em>JCO</em>) and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>

Categories for disclosure include employment; leadership; stock or other ownership; honoraria; consulting or advisory role; speakers bureau; research funding; patents, royalties, other intellectual property; expert testimony; travel, accommodations, expenses; and other relationships.
