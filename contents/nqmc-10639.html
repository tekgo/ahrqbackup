<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: To calculate domain scores, all relevant survey item responses were first standardized to a 0-to-1 scale, with 1 being the most desired response. For each domain, the mean of all included items was calculated for each survey to obtain patient and staff survey domain means (this accounts for varying numbers of items in each domain as well as the varying numbers of surveys collected at different sites). Finally, the means of the patient survey and the staff survey domain means were calculated (so that staff and patient scores carry equal weight in the overall domain score) and multiplied by 100. The domain scores are thus reported on standardized scales of 0 to 100 for each organization, with 100 being the best possible score. Refer to the <em>C-CAT Sampling and Analysis Guide</em> in the "Companion Documents" field for additional information. </p>
<p class="Note">This measure is one of nine composite measures derived from the C-CAT.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Effective communication is the foundation for quality health care (Kaplan, Greenfield, &amp; Ware, 1989; Flach et al., 2004; Markova &amp; Broome, 2007; Institute of Medicine Committee on Communication for Behavior Change in the 21st Century, 2002; Ashton et al., 2003; Gordon, Baker, &amp; Levinson, 1995; Seidel, 2004; Wanzer, Booth-Butterfield, &amp; Gruber, 2004; Safran et al., 2001; Zolnierek &amp; Dimatteo, 2009; Divi et al., 2007; The Joint Commission, 2007; Scalise, 2006). Communication between health care practitioners, patients, and other members of care teams affects patient satisfaction (Gordon, Baker, &amp; Levinson, 1995; Wanzer, Booth-Butterfield, &amp; Gruber, 2004; Safran et al., 2001), adherence to treatment recommendations (Seidel, 2004; Safran et al., 2001; Zolnierek &amp; Dimatteo, 2009), and patient safety (Divi et al., 2007; The Joint Commission, 2007; Scalise, 2006). According to the Joint Commission, miscommunication is the leading cause of sentinel events (serious medical errors) (The Joint Commission, 2007). In addition, health and health care disparities are created when miscommunication disproportionately affects certain patient populations (Institute of Medicine Committee on Communication for Behavior Change in the 21st Century, 2002; Ashton et al., 2003; Gregg, 2004; Cene et al., 2009; Weech-Maldonado et al., 2008). As a result, understanding and improving communication may be a key to addressing disparities (Institute of Medicine Committee on Communication for Behavior Change in the 21st Century, 2002), which is an important national health policy goal (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2009).</p>
<p>Patient-centered communication is well recognized as a key to quality care, and an organization's climate and infrastructure can affect communication in a number of important ways. A set of assessment tools was developed to measure a hospital or clinic's organizational climate specifically in regard to patient-centered communication. The tools provide a 360&deg; evaluation of organizational communication climate and include patient and staff surveys that can be used to derive standardized domain scores in each of 9 key areas of organizational communication climate.</p>
<p>An organization should create an environment that is respectful to populations with diverse backgrounds; this includes helping its workforce understand socio-cultural factors that affect health beliefs and the ability to interact with the health care system.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Health literacy refers to a person's ability to understand and act on health information (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2004). A growing body of evidence demonstrates that compared to individuals with adequate health literacy skills, those with limited health literacy are more likely to misunderstand health information (Friedman, Hoffman-Goetz, &amp; Arocha, 2006); face difficulty following medical instructions (Davis et al., 2006); inappropriately or infrequently use health care services (Gazmararian et al., 1999; Sudore et al., 2006); have worse physical and mental health (Wolf, Gazmararian, &amp; Baker, 2005); experience higher rates of hospitalization (Baker et al., 2002); and have a shorter life expectancy (Baker et al., 2007). Efforts to overcome limited health literacy have included developing plain language, patient-friendly education materials and navigation aids (Stableford &amp; Mettger, 2007); educating healthcare professionals about health literacy issues (Riley, Cloonan, &amp; Rogan, 2008); redesigning patient informed consent forms (Lorenzen, Melby, &amp; Earles, 2008); and using established communication methods such as the "teach back" techniques when communicating with patients (Villaire &amp; Mayer, 2007). While experts agree that implementing a range of system-wide strategies may be the most effective means of overcoming limited health literacy (Murphy-Knoll, 2007; O'Leary, Davis, &amp; Cordell, 2007), system-wide change to address limited health literacy has been difficult to stimulate and slow to develop in most health care organizations (Stableford &amp; Mettger, 2007). </li>
    <li>Recent evidence suggests that even when providers know about health literacy and the need for enhanced communication techniques, they underutilize these strategies (Turner et al., 2009). Many effective health communication strategies have been studied by physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, but remain unincorporated into routine clinical practice (Schwartzberg et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Obtaining informed consent is difficult when there are communication gaps between the clinician and the patient. For example, more than 90 million people in the United States (43% of adults) have literacy levels below what they need to understand most health information, including informed consent discussions (Marcus, 2006; National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2006; IOM, 2004). Lack of adequate skills to read or understand health care information is a particularly serious problem for the elderly, recent immigrants, and patients with limited educational attainment (Weiss, 2005). In addition, 22 million Americans have limited English proficiency, which poses a significant hurdle to effective health care communication (Flores, 2006). </li>
    <li>Research has shown that limited English proficiency (LEP) patients and patients from minority racial/ethnic groups experience communication problems more frequently than patients who speak English and those from traditionally advantaged groups. Regarding LEP patients, Flores (2005) has shown that provision of interpreters for LEP patients positively affects preventive screening rates, while those who either get no interpreter or an ad hoc interpreter have more medical tests, higher costs, and higher rates of hospitalization. Regarding patients of minority race/ethnicity, Hausman et al. (2011) have found that perceived racism is higher among African American patients than white patients, and that perceived racism negatively affects patient ratings of ease of communication (odds ratio [OR] 0.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07 to 0.67). </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Effective communication is critical to providing quality health care and can be affected by a number of modifiable organizational factors. Wynia et al. (2010) performed a prospective multisite validation study of an organizational communication climate assessment tool in 13 geographically and ethnically diverse health care organizations. Communication climate was measured across 9 discrete domains. Patient and staff surveys with matched items in each domain were developed using a national consensus process, which then underwent psychometric field testing and assessment of domain coherence. The authors found meaningful within-site and between-site performance score variability in all domains. In multivariable models, most communication domains were significant predictors of patient-reported quality of care and trust. The authors conclude that these assessment tools provide a valid empirical assessment of organizational communication climate in 9 domains. Assessment results may be useful to track organizational performance, to benchmark, and to inform tailored quality improvement interventions. </p></div>
