Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess whether the state collects and reports specific Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) results regarding whether parents of Medicaid-enrolled children get treatment or counseling services for their children when their children experience emotional, developmental, or behavioral problems.</p>
<p>This measure uses data on parent perceptions of the availability of treatment or counseling for Medicaid‐enrolled children experiencing emotional, developmental, or behavioral problems. The data are collected via CAHPS, specifically a question from the optional Item Set for Children with Chronic Conditions (CCC) supplement to the CAHPS Health Plan Survey&mdash;Child Medicaid. The treatment or counseling availability question is written as follows in the CAHPS CCC Item Set currently offered:</p>
<p class="Indent"><em>Version 4.0: In the last 6 months, how often was it easy to get this treatment or counseling for your child?</em></p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This question is asked of parents who answered affirmatively that they obtained or tried to obtain treatment or counseling for their child for an emotional, developmental, or behavioral problem in the previous 6 months. </li>
    <li>The term "state" implies other geographical entities, such as United States territories.</li>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Availability and Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) (the CAHPS Measure)</em><br />
Medicaid's EPSDT benefit provides the foundation for comprehensive and preventive health care services for all Medicaid-enrolled children under age 21. Health screenings are mandated by the EPSDT guidelines, under which states are required to arrange (directly or through referral) for corrective treatment as indicated by the screenings, which include screening for developmental and behavioral concerns. Further, states must report to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) the number of children referred for corrective treatment (Medicaid.gov, 2014). The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) measure assesses if parents are able to secure this care, regardless of whether the need derives from EPSDT screening or any other impetus.</p>
<p><em>The Value of Reporting Results on Availability of Care (the Q-METRIC Measure)</em><br />
This Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC) measure requires states to report CAHPS data regarding whether parents of Medicaid-enrolled children get treatment or counseling for their children when needed. The value of a parent‐reported measure is that it offers a comprehensive view of both the need for care and the receipt of services across settings. Contrary to specialty care, treatment and counseling can occur in a multitude of settings; therefore, medical record reviews are unlikely to capture services provided through schools or community agencies. Utilization measures will be incomplete if they do not capture behavioral/mental health services provided under both medical benefits and behavioral/mental health carve‐outs, and would not include services provided but not billed. Furthermore, neither of these methods will capture unmet need. Thus, parents' views may be the most accurate indicator on the availability of treatment and counseling services.</p>
<p>Reporting about parental views on the availability of care is presumed to foster improvement through two mechanisms (Werner &amp; Asch, 2005). First, by ensuring a consistent mechanism to generate data on treatment or counseling availability, Medicaid programs can track their progress toward improving parental perceptions of availability of behavioral/mental health services for their beneficiaries. Second, if such information is reported in a forum accessible to the public, patients (parents) have additional information on which to compare health plans (when available), and all stakeholders have a mechanism to compare availability across states and to track progress over time (Werner &amp; Asch, 2005). </p>
<p>Public reporting in the health care setting is defined as data, publicly available or available to a broad audience free of charge or at a nominal cost, about a health care structure, process, or outcome at any provider level (individual clinician, group, or organizations [e.g., hospitals, nursing facilities]) or at the health plan level ("Public reporting," 2012). Public reporting is seen as a possible way to bridge the gap between current and improved levels of quality in the practice of health care (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2011). Both consumer‐driven and provider‐driven changes can improve the quality of care after the initiation of public reporting (Werner, Stuart, &amp; Polsky, 2010). Likewise, a study of the effect that voluntary information disclosure had on quality of care in health maintenance markets showed a significant and positive effect on quality (Jung, 2010). Disclosing data collected as part of the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) led to a ~7% improvement in quality scores, though improvement was not universal across all quality measures (Jung, 2010).</p>
<p>Public reporting has also been noted to have the potential for unintended and negative consequences (Werner &amp; Asch, 2005). These largely derive from the scenario in which physicians or providers screen their patients to avoid negative outcomes in their reported performance scores. As this measure relies on aggregate and anonymous reporting, it is not expected that these unintended negative consequences will occur.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Performance Gaps</em><br />
Research shows a variety of issues related to the availability of behavioral/mental health treatment and counseling for Medicaid-enrolled children:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Physicians report varying degrees of success in their ability to refer Medicaid- and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)-enrolled patients versus privately insured patients to specialists. Mental health care (such as psychology and psychiatry) is one of "the most frequently cited specialties for children" by physicians when asked with which specialties they experienced the most difficulty when referring children (United States Government Accountability Office, 2011). </li>
    <li>Parents may have different expectations regarding their roles in setting up specialist appointments for a child (Stille et al., 2007; Clark et al., 2014). It is possible this type of relationship extends to treatment and counseling appointments when parents are referred or directed by other authority figures. </li>
    <li>Many states and regions have variable geographic distribution and shortages of specialists. In particular, developmental behavioral pediatrics typically requires larger populations of children to attract a physician (Mayer, 2006). </li>
</ul>
<p>Research shows that consumers are beginning to seek out health care quality data. A report by the Kaiser Family Foundation (2004) noted that the number of consumers seeking such information increased from 27% in 2000 to 35% in 2004; moreover, 14% of consumers reported using quality information to choose health plans. However, the extent of public reporting varies by state.</p>
<p><em>Availability and Medicaid/CHIP</em><br />
According to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), approximately 43 million children are currently covered by Medicaid/CHIP programs (Medicaid.gov, n.d.). Recent research estimates one in six U.S. children experience developmental disorders of one kind or another (Boyle et al., 2011). Other research estimates that nearly half of all children will experience an emotional or behavioral disorder (separate from developmental disorders) at some point in their life (Merikangas et al., 2010). Combined, this evidence suggests that a significant proportion of children at some point will be in a situation to require treatment or counseling services and that the overall number of Medicaid‐enrolled children needing these services could be substantial. Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey data are focused on capturing the parent's success in obtaining this care. The Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC) measure is focused on ensuring that states collect and report this data in a systematic manner, demonstrating whether states and programs make this information publicly available to allow tracking over time.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability</strong><br />
<em>Data and Methods</em>. This measure has two aspects of reliability to consider: reliability of reporting the specific availability measure and reliability of the data collected.</p>
<p>The first aspect, reliability of reporting the specific availability measure, has not been assessed. Reliability of reporting is expected to be high, as common threats to reliability identified by the National Quality Forum (2011) (specifically "ambiguous measure specifications" and "small case volume or sample size") are not expected to be concerns. </p>
<p>The second aspect is the reliability of the underlying Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) data. This measure is based on parents' responses to the CAHPS survey. CAHPS surveys have been extensively tested for reliability and have been consistently found to have high reliability (&gt;0.70) (Dyer et al., 2012; Scholle et al., 2012). There may be some concern over using a single‐item question to assess the concept of availability. However, West et al. (2012) found that reliability of single‐item measures is relatively unaffected compared with multiple‐item measures of the same concept. Hays, Reise, &amp; Calder&oacute;n (2012) hypothesized that this may be due to the narrowness of the concept being measured, which would be consistent with the current measure's conceptual focus. As a consequence, a high degree of reliability is anticipated for this measure.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><br />
<em>Validity of CAHPS Questions</em>. CAHPS is a well-established tool for obtaining patient reports of their health care experience and is accepted by a variety of stakeholder groups. The measurement question was only asked of parents who responded <strong><em>Yes</em></strong> when asked if they got or tried to get treatment or counseling for their child for an emotional, developmental, or behavioral problem in the previous 6 months. CAHPS tests their surveys for reliability and validity, and notes that the survey results "will be reliable and valid if (the survey) specifications are followed" (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2012). Medicaid programs are likely to contract with approved CAHPS vendors who agree to adhere to CAHPS specifications, and thus their CAHPS results would be expected to maintain their validity. </p>
<p><em>Face Validity</em>. The validity of this measure was determined from face validity, the degree to which the measure construct characterizes the concept being assessed. The face validity of the relevant CAHPS question was reviewed by a panel convened by Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC). The Q-METRIC expert panel included nationally recognized experts representing pediatrics, family medicine, psychiatry, dentistry, and two parent representatives. In addition, validity was considered by experts in state Medicaid program operations, health plan quality measurement, health informatics, and health care quality measurement. In total, the Q-METRIC Availability of Specialty Services panel included 13 experts, providing a comprehensive perspective on the availability of specialty services and the measurement of quality metrics for states and health plans.</p>
<p>The Q-METRIC expert panel concluded that this measure has a high degree of face validity through a detailed review of concepts and metrics considered to be essential to the ability of parents to obtain appointments for children referred to treatment and counseling. Concepts and draft measures were rated by this group for their relative importance. The measure was rated as follows: parent-reported-availability of specialty appointments received a score of 6.7 on a scale of 1 to 9, with 9 representing the highest possible ranking.</p>
<p>The Q-METRIC expert panel had additional discussion about the data that would be reported out for this measure. Prior to deciding to use the CAHPS measure, this discussion included such topics as whether appointments should refer to urgent or non‐urgent appointments, and whether the measure should be stratified by age due to the typical practice that mental health practitioners often do not see patients under age 3 or 4.</p></div>
