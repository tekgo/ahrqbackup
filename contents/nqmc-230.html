<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Health behaviors, such as alcohol use and drunk driving, sexual activity, depression, suicide, smoking, violence, and guns are the primary causes of morbidity and mortality among adolescents. Preventive counseling and screening on these and other health risk topics are the centerpiece of adolescent preventive services guidelines. Common components in adolescent preventive services guidelines set forth by the American Medical Association (AMA), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the U.S. Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) include:</p> 

<ol>
<li>Periodic adolescent health care visits specifically 
  focused on preventive screening and counseling. 
  
<li>Private and confidential care whereby adolescents can 
  meet privately with providers with assurances of confidentiality. 
  
<li>Education and counseling on behavioral, emotional, 
  and medical risks to health. This includes encouraging good health habits 
  (e.g., healthy eating, physical activity) and providing guidance on avoiding 
  risky behaviors (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, unprotected sexual activity, 
  drunk driving, ignoring or reacting inappropriately to negative emotions, use 
  of drugs, violence, and guns). 
  
<li>Screening, early identification and referrals for behavioral, emotional, and medical risks. This includes screening for smoking, alcohol, sexual activity, depression, street drug use, involvement in or victim of violence or abuse, access to and use of guns, and unsafe practices such as infrequent helmet and seatbelt use or driving in a care with a driver who has been drinking alcohol.</li></ol>

<p>Studies demonstrate that adolescents trust health care providers. Adolescents are interested and willing to talk with providers about recommended preventive counseling and screening topics, especially during private, confidential health care visits. Yet, for many reasons, including young adult access barriers to care and provider training and incentives, few adolescents receive recommended comprehensive preventive counseling and screening services on key topics such as alcohol use, depression, sexual activity, smoking, injury prevention, physical activity, and diet.</p>

<p>Among other strategies, performance measurement can be a powerful component of efforts to improve preventive services for adolescents. Experts and consumers emphasize the importance of adolescent preventive care as a top priority for health care system accountability and performance reporting, and point to the current lack of measurement methods. While the rate at which adolescents have yearly well-visits is being used by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as a national indicator of quality for health maintenance organizations, this measure provides no information about the provision of preventive counseling and screening nor takes into account the fact that preventive services are often provided outside the context of well-visits.</p>

<p>The Young Adult Health Care Survey (YAHCS) was developed to complement existing performance measurement methods. This 45-item survey was designed to provide a parsimonious, comprehensive and actionable assessment of adherence to adolescent preventive counseling and screening guidelines.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Health behaviors, such as alcohol use and drunk

the primary causes of morbidity and mortality among adolescents. The 1995 Youth 
Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey, a national survey of students in grades nine 
through 12, revealed that 72% of all deaths among school-aged youth were 
the result of four primary causes: motor vehicle accidents, other unintentional 
injury, homicide and suicide. Similar data from patients five to 21 years of age 
identified the same causes of mortality, indicating a need for physicians to 
focus on accidents and violence in preventive care.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><ul>
<li>1999: Five health plans and one professional review organization: CIGNA HealthCare (Southern California Branch), Blue Cross Blue Shield of the Rochester Area, Permanente Medical Group, San Francisco Health 
Plan, United Health Plan, and the Institute for Child Health Policy, as part of their Florida KidCare Evaluation efforts. The psychometric properties of the Young Adult Health Care Survey (YAHCS) measures of care were examined and confirmed to be sound.</li>
<br><br>
In-depth cognitive testing of the draft survey was conducted with 35 
adolescents representing different socioeconomic groups, resulting in 
adjustments to the design, formatting, and wording of survey items.  
Readability analyses indicate that the YAHCS survey items are written at the 6th-8th grade reading level and cognitive testing confirmed the readability of the YAHCS across adolescents with a range of educational levels.
<br><br>
YAHCS measurement scales demonstrated strong construct validity (mean factor loading = 0.64) and reliability (mean Cronbach's alpha =      
0.77).</p>

<li>2000-2001: Washington State Department of Health to assess for quality of care provided to adolescents enrolled in Medicaid in 
Snohomish County. Psychometric properties assessed and were confirmed again. Findings were similar to those shown by Bethell and colleagues.
