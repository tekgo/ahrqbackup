Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level 30-day risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal diagnosis of heart failure (HF). The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission. A specified set of planned readmissions do not count as readmissions. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Readmission of patients who were recently discharged after hospitalization with heart failure (HF) represents an important, expensive, and often preventable adverse outcome. The risk of readmission can certainly be modified by the quality and type of care provided to these patients. Improving readmission rates is the joint responsibility of hospitals and clinicians. Measuring readmission will create incentives to invest in interventions to improve hospital care, better assess the readiness of patients for discharge and facilitate transitions to outpatient status.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Many care processes that can influence readmission risk. In general, randomized controlled trials have shown that improvement in the following areas can directly reduce readmission rates: quality of care during the initial admission; improvement in communication with patients, their caregivers, and their clinicians; patient education; predischarge assessment; and coordination of care after discharge. Evidence that hospitals have been able to reduce readmission rates through these quality-of-care initiatives illustrates the degree to which hospital practices can affect readmission rates. Successful randomized trials have reduced 30-day readmission rates by 20% to 40% (Jack et al., 2009; Coleman et al., 2004; Courtney et al., 2009; Garasen, Windspoll, &amp; Johnsen, 2007; Koehler et al., 2009; Mistiaen, Francke, &amp; Poot, 2007; Naylor et al., 1994; Naylor et al., 1999; van Walraven et al., 2002; Weiss, Yakusheva, &amp; Bobay, 2010; Krumholz et al., 2002). Since 2008, 14 Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations have been funded to focus on care transitions, applying lessons learned from clinical trials. Several have been notably successful in reducing readmissions. The strongest evidence supporting the efficacy of improved discharge processes and enhanced care at transitions is a randomized controlled trial by the Project RED (Re-Engineered Discharge) intervention, in which a nurse was assigned to each patient as a discharge advocate, responsible for patient education, follow-up, medication reconciliation, and preparing individualized discharge instructions sent to the patient's primary care provider (Jack et al., 2009). There was also a follow-up phone call from a pharmacist within 4 days of discharge. This intervention demonstrated a 30% reduction in 30-day readmissions (Jack et al., 2009). Hospital processes that reflect the quality of inpatient and outpatient care such as discharge planning, medication reconciliation, and coordination of outpatient care have been shown to reduce readmission rates (Nelson, Maruish, &amp; Axler, 2000). Although readmission rates are also influenced by hospital system characteristics, such as the bed capacity of the local health care system, these hospital characteristics should not influence quality of care (Fisher et al., 1994). Therefore, this measure does not risk adjust for such hospital characteristics. </p>
<p>The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) (2007) has called for hospital-specific public reporting of readmission rates, identifying heart failure (HF) as a priority condition. MedPAC finds that readmissions are common, costly, and often preventable. Based on 2005 Medicare data, MedPAC estimates that about 12.5% of Medicare HF admissions were followed by a readmission within 15 days, accounting for more than 90,000 admissions at a cost of $590 million. Between July 2005 and June 2008, the median 30-day readmission rate for HF was 24.4%, with a range of 15.9% to 34.4% (Krumholz et al., 2009). </p>
<p>HF incidence approaches 10 per 1000 of the population after 65 years of age (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2007); prevalence of HF in the U.S. is estimated at nearly 6 million (Mozaffarian et al., 2015; Lloyd-Jones et al., 2010). HF is the most common principal discharge diagnosis among older adults and the third highest for hospital reimbursements in 2005 (Jessup &amp; Brozena, 2003; Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services [CMS], 2006), and the leading cause of readmission among Medicare beneficiaries, with nearly half of HF patients expected to return to the hospital within 6 months of discharge (Jencks, Williams, &amp; Coleman, 2009; Krumholz et al., 1997). All-cause 30-day readmission rates per 1,000 patients discharged with HF increased by 11% between 1992 and 2001 (Merrill, 2003). HF readmission is a costly event and represents an undesirable outcome of care from the patient's perspective, and highly disparate HF readmission rates among hospitals suggest there is room for improvement (MedPAC, 2007; Bernheim et al., 2010). Moreover, there is substantial inter-hospital variation in the risk of readmission that is not clearly explained by differences in case mix.</p>
<p>The HF risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) measure is thus intended to inform quality-of-care improvement efforts, as individual process-based performance measures cannot encompass all the complex and critical aspects of care within a hospital that contribute to patient outcomes. Many stakeholders, including patient organizations, are interested in outcomes measures that allow patients and providers to assess relative outcomes performance for hospitals. </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models</strong></p>
<p>The heart failure (HF) readmission measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year.</p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero.</p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.4 of the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><strong>HF Readmission 2017 Model Result</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of HF Model Variables</em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Increases in Asthma (10.1% to 13.3%), Cardio-respiratory failure and shock (29.9% to 33.7%), Other psychiatric disorders (21.1% to 23.6%), and Renal failure (62.8% to 65.0%) </li>
    <li>A decrease in Other urinary tract disorders (30.9% to 28.5%) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>HF Model Parameters and Performance</em></p>
<p>Table 4.4.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.4.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the HF readmission model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic remained constant at 0.61.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Inclusions</strong><br />
The measure assesses unplanned readmissions, from any cause, with 30 days from the date of discharge from an index heart failure (HF) admission.</p>
<p>If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, only the first is considered a readmission. The measures assess a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has any unplanned readmission within 30 days. If the first readmission after discharge is planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not considered in the outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.</p>
<p>The risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions at a given hospital, multiplied by the national observed readmission rate. For each hospital, the numerator of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted based on the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.</p>
<p class="Note">See the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;cid=1219069855841" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 Condition-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures</a></em> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Admissions identified as planned by the planned readmissions algorithm are not counted as readmissions. The planned readmission algorithm is a set of criteria for classifying readmissions and planned among the general Medicare population using Medicare administrative claims data. The algorithm identified admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. </p>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm has three fundamental principles: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>
    <li>Otherwise, a planned readmission is defined as a non-acute readmission for a scheduled procedure; and </li>
    <li>Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned </li>
</ol>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm uses a flow chart and four tables of specific procedure categories and discharge diagnosis categories to classify readmissions as planned. The flow chart and tables are available in the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;cid=1219069855841" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 Condition-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures</a></em>.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measures to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) readmission rates are higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission.</p></div>
