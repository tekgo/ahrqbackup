Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years who have a documented mental health and/or depression screening using one of the specified validated tools at a well-child visit during the measurement period.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Two million United States (U.S.) adolescents ages 12 to 17 years had a major depressive episode in 2008 (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2011). The annual estimate for the percentage of children and adolescents with mental, emotional and behavioral disorders is between 14% and 20% (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2009). National mental health treatment expenditures were estimated at more than $11 billion in 1998 (Ringel &amp; Sturm, 2001).</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics' Bright Futures guidelines report:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Half of all the lifetime cases of mental illness begin by the age of 14 years, which means that mental disorders are chronic diseases of the young. </li>
    <li>An estimated 21% of U.S. children and adolescents ages 9 to 17 years have a diagnosable mental health disorder that causes at least some impairment. The under-detection of mental health problems in pediatric practice has been well documented and recognized. </li>
    <li>One of the most efficient ways for health care professionals to improve the recognition and treatment of psychosocial problems in children and adolescents is by using a mental health screening tool. </li>
</ul>
<p>U.S. Preventive Services Task Force conducted a study in April 2009 assessing the health effects of routine primary care screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) among children and adolescents ages 7 to 18 years, including evaluating the accuracy of screening tests. The study concluded primary care feasible screening tools may be accurate in identifying depressed adolescents. Pilot testing of measure with 17 medical groups representing 123 clinics and 20,350 adolescents demonstrated opportunity for improvement and variability among practices with an overall average rate of screening of 46.3%.</p></div>

Validity testing is done to see if the concept behind the measure reflects the quality of care that is provided to a patient and if the measure, as specified, accurately assesses the intended quality concept. Reliability testing is done to see if calculated performance scores are reproducible.</p></div>
