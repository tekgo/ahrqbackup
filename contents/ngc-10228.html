Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The primary literature search employed the MEDLINE (via the PubMed interface) and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. The search strategies used a combination of subject heading terms appropriate for each database and key words relevant to airway clearance (e.g., sputum clearance, CPT). Reviewers limited searches to literature published in English since 1990 to ensure that interventions used currently would be represented. The searches were conducted in August 2012. Reviewers imported all citations into an electronic database and into the DistillerSR program for screening. They also manually searched the reference lists of included studies and of recent narrative and systematic reviews and meta-analyses addressing airway clearance in adults to locate citations of potential relevance.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Studies needed to include subjects over 1 year of age without cystic fibrosis, who were receiving nonpharmacologic airway clearance therapies and who were either hospitalized (but not postoperative) or postoperative, had neuromuscular disease or respiratory muscle weakness, or who had impaired cough. Note that reviewers excluded studies of subjects with cystic fibrosis, as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recently published guidelines specifically related to airway clearance. Studies had to report on interventions explicitly used for airway clearance and include a treatment group and an appropriate comparison group (see Table 1 in the systematic review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Comparators included other nonpharmacologic airway clearance approaches, no airway clearance intervention, or placebo. The reviewers also required that studies address one of the outcomes related to the effects of the intervention on mucus clearance outlined in Table 1 in the systematic review. Studies with any length of follow-up and in the hospital setting (i.e., not home- or out-patient-clinic-based) were included.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Once they identified potential articles, reviewers examined the abstracts to determine whether studies met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers separately evaluated each abstract for inclusion or exclusion, using an abstract review form. If one reviewer concluded that the article could be eligible for the review based on the abstract, it was retained for full text assessment. Two reviewers independently assessed the full text of each included study, using a standardized form that included questions stemming from the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by a third-party adjudicator. The group of abstract and full text reviewers included expert clinicians and health services researchers, and studies had to be excluded by at least one clinician and one methodologist. AARC members involved in screening were paired with Vanderbilt Evidence-Based Practice Center staff in order to maintain rigor and protect against bias.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Data Extraction and Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>Reviewers extracted data on study design, population characteristics (including age, underlying conditions, and need for mechanical ventilation), intervention characteristics (including type and duration of intervention and concomitant therapies), and key outcomes data into evidence tables. In addition to outcomes related to airway clearance intervention effectiveness, reviewers extracted all data available on harms of airway clearance. Harms encompass the full range of specific negative effects, including the narrower definition of adverse events. Reviewers determined that the differences among populations, interventions, controls, and outcome measures rendered meta-analysis inappropriate. Thus, the analysis was qualitative.</p>
<p><strong>Quality (Risk of Bias) Assessment of Individual Studies</strong></p>
<p>Reviewers assessed quality using separate tools, as appropriate by study design. Tools included the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Reviewers rated the quality for key outcomes for which data were provided. If a study noted, for example, that a given outcome was not significantly different between groups but did not provide the relevant data, the authors did not rate quality for that outcome. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of each study, with final decisions made via discussion to reach consensus or by third-party adjudication by a senior methodologist, as needed. The parameters outlined in Table 2 in the systematic review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) were used to translate quality ratings into final levels (good, fair, poor). Reviewers defined "good" studies as not having any of the criteria that create a high risk of bias. For studies with "unclear" ratings, they considered the likelihood that a factor would bias a given outcome and the importance of the limitation and down-graded the final level as appropriate.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) commissioned a systematic literature review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), and AARC committee members participated in the review process. As a collaborative effort, the AARC team and the Vanderbilt Evidence-Based Practice Center developed the key questions and inclusion and exclusion criteria, and engaged in identification and review of abstracts. The AARC members involved in the work were paired with Vanderbilt Evidence-Based Practice Center staff in order to maintain rigor and protect against bias.</p>
<p>Because no high-level evidence was available and the recommendations are based on low-level evidence, the guideline authors have not used a formal guideline development process such as the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Rather, the recommendations are based on a consensus of the committee, informed by a systematic review of the literature (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and clinical experience. The systematic review helped frame the issues and allowed for an identification of potential harms.</p></div>
