<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patients with diabetes are at high risk of developing neuropathic problems of the lower limbs along with peripheral vascular disease. When these conditions are not diagnosed in the early stage, a window of opportunity is missed to ameliorate symptoms and prevent the development of the foot ulcers, infection, or other causes of limb ischemia that can lead to non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation. Lower-extremity amputation not only leads to physical disability and loss of quality of life, but also to economic burden (i.e., healthcare costs and industrial disability).</p>
<p>The majority of lower-extremity amputations associated with diabetes can be prevented through better primary and specialty care. This starts with early identification of diabetes and long-term glycemic control followed by early identification and appropriate therapy of the patient who is at increased risk for ulceration and amputation. Lowering A1C to below or around 7% has been shown to reduce long-term vascular disease if implemented soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Preventing lower-extremity amputation requires a partnership between providers and patients. Patients at risk require lifelong surveillance, examination of the feet at each healthcare visit, risk stratification, and referral for therapeutic footwear and orthoses when needed. Patients and or caregivers must be educated and equipped to fulfill their responsibilities of daily foot inspection, associated foot care practices, and general diabetic management. Early identification and management of the diabetic neuropathy provides an opportunity to alleviate symptoms and prevent the development of major clinical neuropathic endpoint of the lower limbs. When infection or a wound does occur, proper wound care, optimal metabolic control, and early aggressive, appropriate surgical and medical therapy can often preserve function and prevent the loss of limb.</p>
<p>This measure is an avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) type indicator. ACSC type indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of potentially avoidable hospitalization if appropriate outpatient care, other healthcare services or community services were accessed and obtained (i.e., measures of the health care system broadly defined). These measures are designed to assess population access to timely, high quality outpatient and public health services in a particular geographic area, for the purpose of managing chronic disease or diagnosing acute illnesses before progressing to inpatient treatment. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), accountable care organizations (ACOs) or public health agencies. ACSC indicators correlate with each other and they may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a national, regional or county level.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In the United States, there are approximately 24 million people (7.8% of the population) currently living with diabetes, nearly 6 million of whom are unaware of their diagnosis (American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2010). The financial cost of diabetes is estimated at approximately $132 billion annually; $92 billion is attributed to direct medical care and the remaining $40 billion is due to disability, work loss, and premature mortality (Hogan, Dall, &amp; Nikolov, 2003). With the continued increase in diabetic prevalence, it is estimated that annual diabetes-related costs will reach $336 billion by 2034 (Huang et al., 2009). Much of the costs associated with diabetes results from long-term complications, such as lower-extremity amputation (Correa-de-Araujo, McDermott, &amp; Moy, 2006; Abou-Zamzam et al., 2007). Patients with diabetes are 20 times more likely to undergo a lower-extremity amputation than those without (van Houtum, Lavery, &amp; Harkless, 1996). Diabetic patients who have lower-extremity amputation and other diabetes-related foot disorders have lower quality-of-life measures (health-related quality of life, physical functioning, social functioning, and mental health) compared to other patients with diabetes (Hjelm, Nyberg, &amp; Apelqvist, 2002). Given the important economic, health, and personal costs, reducing the number of diabetes-related lower-extremity amputation has become a national healthcare priority (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000).</p>
<p>Despite the ADA (2013) long standing recommendations for neurological foot examinations, many practitioners are unable to correctly identify peripheral neuropathy in their patients (Driver et al., 2010). A large telephone survey of patients with diabetes also confirmed that patients did not recognize the term neuropathy and did not associated the term with the cause of their neuropathic symptoms (Sanders, 2005). Besides long-term glycemic control (which reduces the risk of lower-extremity amputation but does not appear to change the overall risk of macrovascular complications) (Hemmingsen et al., 2011), team approaches to manage diabetic foot ulcers, such as foot clinics, outpatient case management programs, limb salvage teams, increased access to care, and podiatrists have been shown to significantly reduces diabetic lower-extremity amputation rates (Driver et al., 2010; R&uuml;menapf et al., 2013; Robbins, Valdmanis, &amp; Webb, 2008; Gibson et al., 2014; Etnyre et al., 2011; Sloan et al., 2008). According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Fact Sheet (2011), it is estimated that 45% to 85% of amputations can be prevented by comprehensive foot care programs (i.e., that include risk assessment, foot-care education and preventive therapy, treatment of foot problems, and referral to specialists).</p>
<p>Amputations are higher for black Americans and other racial groups compared to white (CDC, 2011; Gornick et al., 1996; Chin, Zhang, &amp; Merrell, 1998). Many of the racial differences in amputation can be attributed to access to care and family poverty. Racial differences are diminished when access to care is equivocal (Karter et al., 2002; Reiber, Pecoraro, &amp; Koepsell, 1992; Selby &amp; Zhang, 1995). </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong><br />
The developer's metric of reliability is the signal to noise ratio, which is the ratio of the between county (area) variance (signal) to the within county (area) variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). There is a county (area)-specific signal to noise ratio, which is used as an empirical Bayes univariate shrinkage estimator. The overall signal to noise ratio is a weighted average of the county (area)-specific signal-to-noise ratio, where the weight is [1 / (signal + noise)^2]. The signal is calculated using an iterative method. The analysis reports the reliability of the risk-adjusted rate (before applying the empirical Bayes univirate shrinkage estimator).</p>
<p>Overall the risk-adjusted rate is moderately reliable. Based on a norm of a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.80, 30% of counties (areas) exceed the norm. Reliability is less than the norm in counties with population less than approximately 35,000 persons, meaning that the performance score is reliability adjusted closer to the shrinkage target in those counties.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong><br />
The developer conducted construct validity testing to examine the association between the risk-adjusted rate and county (area) structural characteristics potentially associated with quality of care, including prior performance, using regression analysis.</p>
<p>Given the stated rationale, the expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "Less Access to High Quality Outpatient Care" construct validity measure (F1) and the county (area) risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "More Market Competition" construct validity measure (F2) and the county (area) risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The results are consistent with expectations. Also, past performance is a moderate predictor of current performance with a coefficient of 0.75.</p>

Description of Allowance for Patient or Population Factors
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The predicted value for each case is computed using a hierarchical model (logistic regression with area random effect) and covariates for gender and age (in 5-year age groups). The reference population used in the regression is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Data (SID) for the year 2010 (combined), a database consisting of 46 states and approximately 38 million adult discharges, and the United States (U.S.) Census data by county. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., area). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population rate.</p>
