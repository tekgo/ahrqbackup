Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the level of the evidence (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) and strength of the recommendations (<strong>Grade A-C</strong>) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Despite its widespread and longtime use, there have been a limited number of studies that have examined the effect of assisted hatching (AH) on live birth rate (LBR). As a result, there is insufficient evidence that AH improves birth rates (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>There is good evidence that AH slightly improves clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) in poor prognosis patients, including those with prior failed in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles and who have a poor prognosis (<strong>Level A</strong>). </li>
    <li>AH appears to be associated with an increased risk of multiple pregnancy (<strong>Level A</strong>), but there is insufficient evidence that it is associated with an increased risk of monozygotic (MZ) twin pregnancy (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Until data about LBR are available and in the context of increased risk of multiple pregnancy, it is premature to recommend AH in all patients with poor prognosis. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>AH should not be recommended routinely for all patients undergoing IVF (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized, controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong>: There is good evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong>: There is fair evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong>: There is insufficient evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>A systematic literature search was performed using the following two search strategies:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>(Assisted OR zona hatching OR drilling OR thinning) AND (pregnancy OR implantation OR live birth) AND blastocyst </li>
    <li>Assisted hatching AND in vitro fertilization (IVF) (Humans [Mesh] AND English [lang]) </li>
</ol>
<p>The literature search was performed from 1966 through November 2013. Studies were eligible if they met one the following criteria: primary evidence (clinical trials) which assessed the effectiveness of procedure correlated with an outcome measure (pregnancy, implantation or live birth rates), meta-analyses, and relevant articles from bibliographies of identified articles.</p>
<p>Randomized trials, cohort studies, case control studies and cross-sectional studies written in English were selected for review. Two reviewers screened the papers by title and abstracts. Then full text papers were obtained and reviewed.</p></div>

<p>Quality of the studies was assessed by reviewing the study design, assessment of exposure and outcome, confounders, bias, statistical methods, and reported limitations. The quality of the evidence was evaluated using grading system found in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field. The strength of the evidence was evaluated by the guideline committee after reviewing the results of the literature search and recommendations were graded as described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Many assisted reproductive technology (ART) programs have incorporated the use of assisted hatching (AH) in an effort to improve clinical outcomes. There is good evidence that AH slightly improves clinical pregnancy rates in poor prognosis patients, including those with prior failed in vitro fertilization cycles and who have a poor prognosis.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The assisted hatching procedure may be associated with specific complications independent of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure itself, including lethal damage to the embryo and damage to individual blastomeres with reduction of embryo viability. In addition, artificial manipulation of the zona pellucida (ZP) has been associated with an increased risk of monozygotic (MZ) twin pregnancy. </li>
    <li>Despite limited evidence of the benefits or risks, patients whose embryos undergo assisted hatching are often treated with antibiotics and steroids before and after embryo transfer (ET), exposing them to the potential risks and side effects of such treatments. </li>
</ul>
