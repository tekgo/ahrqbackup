Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The guideline was developed by an interdisciplinary workgroup using a process that combined evidence- and consensus-based approaches. The workgroup included practitioners and others involved in patient care in long-term care facilities. Beginning with a general guideline developed by an agency, association, or organization such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), pertinent articles and information, and a draft outline, the group worked to make a concise, usable guideline that is tailored to the long-term care setting. Because scientific research in the long-term care population is limited, many recommendations were based on the expert opinion of practitioners in the field.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Following the steps in this guideline should permit facilities and their staff and practitioners to:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Optimize their approach to problematic behavior and delirium.</li>

<li>Prevent unnecessary hospitalizations.</li>

<li>Avoid over-reliance on psychiatric consultation for problematic behavior or altered mental function that might harm the patient if it substitutes for or delays recognition and management of medical causes.</li></ul></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Hospitalization of patients with problematic behavior and delirium may be traumatic for the patient. Hospital staff may not be familiar with the patient's history and symptoms, understand what triggers the problematic behavior, or be aware of the environment in which the patient functions. Frequently, hospitalization omits vital supportive care or relevant nonpharmacologic approaches and may result in undesirable changes in the patient's medication regimen. Many patients have a recurrence of problematic behavior after hospitalization, and repeat hospital transfers may not be any more helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Adverse Effects of Medications</strong></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Unwarranted or unnecessarily prolonged <em>antibiotic</em> treatment is a widespread concern. Antibiotics can lead to additional complications (e.g., anorexia- or diarrhea-related fluid loss) that can contribute to impaired mental function or to the development of resistant organisms.</li>

<li>All <em>antipsychotics</em> should be used cautiously, and their risks identified and documented, in patients with cerebrovascular risk factors. Patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies generally have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotics. Second-generation antipsychotics may have a lower frequency of extrapyramidal side effects such as parkinsonism or tardive dyskinesia, but all antipsychotics have some significant associated risks.&nbsp; Also, antipsychotics may exacerbate symptoms in patients with Lewy body dementia. All antipsychotic medications have the potential to induce akathisia, a sense of motor restlessness that can result in pacing, physical agitation, and complaints of leg and thigh discomfort.</li>

<li>In April 2005, the FDA issued an overall health advisory concerning an increased risk of death in patients with dementia who are treated with second-generation (so-called &quot;atypical&quot;) antipsychotics. This warning has since been expanded to include all antipsychotic medications. For example, warnings about the use of <em>haloperidol</em> have been revised to include cases of sudden death due to impairment of cardiac conduction in patients treated with this agent, especially when the medication is given intravenously (a common but hazardous off-label use) or at doses higher than recommended.</li>

<li>When inappropriately prescribed for patients with problematic behavior due to other causes, <em>antidepressants</em> may exacerbate symptoms. Excessive serotonin stimulation due to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, alone or in combination with other medications that affect serotonin levels) can lead to agitation, delirium, seizures, other psychiatric symptoms, or death (&quot;serotonin syndrome&quot;). The concurrent use of several antidepressants for diverse symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, pain, appetite stimulation, and insomnia) may also increase the risk for adverse consequences such as falls and serotonin syndrome. Unless another medication in the same class is being substituted, withdrawing antidepressants too rapidly may cause behavioral symptoms that can be mistaken for a return of the underlying condition.</li>

<li>Adverse consequences of <em>cholinesterase inhibitors</em> can include hallucinations, confusion, and agitation, and those for <em>memantine</em> may include fatigue, headache, and hypertension. Cholinesterase inhibitors can also cause anorexia and other gastrointestinal symptoms that eventually lead to weight loss.</li>

<li>Medications with <em>anticholinergic effects</em> can cause problematic behavior and may counteract the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors. Therefore, it is important to review the medication regimen and reduce or eliminate medications with anticholinergic properties or side effects, whether or not cholinesterase inhibitors are being given.</li>

<li><em>Divalproex</em> sodium and other earlier-generation <em>anticonvulsants</em> are associated with significant side effects, such as sedation. <em>Lamotrigine</em> may have fewer significant side effects than the earlier-generation anticonvulsants.</li>

<li>Inappropriate use of <em>benzodiazepines</em> to try to manage patients with delirium and psychosis may permit symptoms to progress and may lead to the use of additional inappropriate and ineffective medications or to avoidable hospitalization. All benzodiazepines are associated to some degree with adverse consequences such as increased confusion, sedation, falls, and hip fractures in a susceptible population. In addition, they may cause increased agitation, insomnia, and other side effects. Tolerance occurs rapidly with short half-life benzodiazepines. Short-half-life benzodiazepines such as lorazepam, which are often used to treat patients with psychosis, delirium, and nonspecific agitated or combative behavior, are best avoided. They are often ineffective and commonly cause oversedation and &quot;rebound&quot; effects (anxiety and insomnia) after each dose.</li></ul></div>
