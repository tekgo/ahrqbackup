Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of all pediatric (less than 18 years old) patient-months in the sample for analysis who were on end stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment for 91 days or more, and dialyzing greater than 2 or less than 4 times weekly whose delivered dose of hemodialysis (calculated from the last measurements of the month using the Urea Kinetic Modeling [UKM] or Daugirdas II formula) was a single pool (sp)Kt/V greater than or equal to 1.2 during the study period.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In considering target single pool (sp)Kt/V, the pediatric hemodialysis population should receive at least a spKt/V of 1.2, which is the minimum requirement for the adult population in order to allow for the increased nutritional needs of children. Analysis of clinical process measure data further support this cutoff since adolescents with spKt/V below 1.2 were found to have significantly increased risk of hospitalization as compared to those with spKt/V of 1.2 to 1.4.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb and Medicare claims data to calculate the inter-unit reliability (IUR) for the overall 12 months to assess the reliability of this measure. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based IUR was estimated using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. The developer notes that the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. Since this measure is not normally distributed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>For reliability the developer calculated the monthly and annual IUR across the 12 reporting months. As explained above, the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. IUR=0.807 with the confidence interval being (0.623, 0.929). This suggests that 81% of variation in the measure is attributed to between facility variation. </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The IUR suggests this measure is moderately reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Assessment based on face validity by the 2010 hemodialysis (HD) pediatric technical expert panel (TEP). </p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>This measure is being maintained on the basis of face validity. </p>
<p>Use of small solute clearance (urea reduction ratio and more recently Kt/V) as a dialysis quality measure was initially developed and approved by the clinical TEP in 2010 on pediatric dialysis adequacy, which agreed that this quality measure domain is important in the assessment of the quality of care for pediatric dialysis patients. Achieving target Kt/V was finalized for the End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP) beginning with program year (PY) 2015, and has been reported on Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) since January 2013. </p>
<p>In July 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the University of Michigan Kidney and Epidemiology Cost Center (UM-KECC) revised this measure in response to concerns from the NQF Steering Committee regarding the appropriateness of single pool Kt/V for measuring Kt/V in patients who are dialyzing 3 or 4 times per week. Members of the committee argued that single pool Kt/V is not appropriate for assessing patients on different dialysis frequencies, i.e., 3 or 4 times. Standard Kt/V would be more appropriate for assessing different dialysis frequencies, such as 3 or 4 times per week. </p>
<p>The 2010 TEP that recommended this measure originally specified that the measure include patients on dialysis 3 or 4 times per week. This was based in part on analyses presented at that 2010 TEP meeting showing that 4 times per week hemodialysis was observed in approximately 5.6% of pediatric patient-weeks, and nearly 90% of pediatric patient-weeks reflected either 3 or 4 times per week hemodialysis (based on 2007 Medicare claims data). Given that this was not an insignificant proportion of patients, as the TEP concluded that these patients should all be included in this measure. UM-KECC recently updated this analysis using 2014 Medicare claims data. This showed that 4 times per week hemodialysis is now observed in 8.06% of patient-weeks and approximately 92% of pediatric patient-weeks reflected either 3 or 4 times per week hemodialysis. Results were generally similar using 2014 CROWNWeb data. About 7% of pediatric patient-weeks were 4 times per week hemodialysis, and 94% of pediatric patient-weeks were 3 or 4 times per week. </p>
<p>In response to the NQF Steering Committee concerns of including patients on 3 or 4 times per week dialysis, UM-KECC contacted the members of the 2010 TEP and asked them to consider a revision to limit the measure to pediatric patients on three times a week dialysis. This revision would make this pediatric hemodialysis adequacy measure consistent with the corresponding adult measure (#0249). A majority of the TEP members supported this revision. To date, 5 of the 2010 TEP members (including the TEP chair) voted to revise the measure and limit it to pediatric patients on 3 times per week dialysis (the 2 remaining TEP members have not yet responded to the request for their feedback on this proposed change). The revised measure retains face validity based on the results of this vote. </p>
<p>Here is the specific decision provided by the TEP Chair on behalf of the TEP: </p>
<p>Specifically, the Pediatric CMS-TEP (2010) members who participated in the Pediatric Hemodialysis Adequacy Technical Expert Panel acknowledged that the measure developed in 2010 pertaining to the use of single pool (sp)Kt/V stipulated that the measure should include patients on 3 and 4 times per week dialysis. However, they also appreciate the concern of the NQF steering committee charged with reviewing the measure for maintenance of endorsement that "the UKM or Daugirdas formulas are designed for a fixed number of dialysis treatments a week, not 3 or 4." In addition, they recognize that there are no data justifying the inclusion of children who receive more than 3 sessions of dialysis per week in this measure. As a result, the TEP members are in favor of revising the specifications to limit the measure to pediatric patients receiving dialysis 3 times per week. They believe that this would be consistent with the adult measure, which specifies that the measure is for adult hemodialysis patients dialyzing 3 times per week (patients dialyzing less than 3 or greater than 3 times per week are excluded). </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>This measure was established on the basis of face validity. Clinical TEP members agreed that this measure will improve quality of care for pediatric HD patients.</p></div>
