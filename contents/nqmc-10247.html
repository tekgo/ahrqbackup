<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy with seizure frequency greater than 0 for whom an intervention to reduce seizure frequency was offered or discussed with the patient or caregiver.</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The main objective in treating epilepsy is to reduce the frequency of seizures and achieve seizure freedom without side effects. An intervention should be considered when patients are not seizure-free, because if intervention is provided seizure freedom may be achieved (Fisher &amp; Handforth, 1999; French et al., "Treatment of new onset epilepsy," 2004; French et al., "Treatment of refractory epilepsy," 2004; Wiebe et al., 2001; Engel et al., 2003; Morris et al., 2013).</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>"All of the new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were found to be appropriate for adjunctive treatment of refractory partial seizures in adults." "The choice of AED depends upon seizure and/or syndrome type, patient age, concomitant medications, AED tolerability, safety, and efficacy" (Fisher &amp; Handforth, 1999). </li>
    <li>The decision to initiate AED therapy should be taken between the child, young person or adult, their family and/or carers (as appropriate) and the specialist after a full discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment. This discussion should take into account details of the person's epilepsy syndrome, prognosis and lifestyle (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2012). </li>
    <li>It is recommended that combination therapy (adjunctive or 'add-on' therapy) should only be considered when attempts at monotherapy with AEDs have not resulted in seizure freedom. If trials of combination therapy do not bring about worthwhile benefits, treatment should revert to the regimen (monotherapy or combination therapy) that has proved most acceptable to the child, young person or adult, in terms of providing the best balance between effectiveness in reducing seizure frequency and tolerability of side effects (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>If the patient continues to have seizures after initiating treatment then interventions should be performed (Pugh et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in adults who are refractory to antiepileptic medication but who are not suitable for resective surgery. This includes adults whose epileptic disorder is dominated by focal seizures (with or without secondary generalization) or generalised seizures (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Evidence exists to rank VNS for epilepsy as effective and safe, based on a preponderance of Class I evidence (Fisher &amp; Handforth, 1999). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Evidence indicates treatment interventions that may result in seizure freedom are not offered in a timely manner. There is likely a group of patients who have treatment resistant (intractable) epilepsy by definition (Kwan et al., 2010) but are not considered by their medical care provider to be treatment resistant because the seizures are considered mild or "infrequent." This measure will assess the degree to which all patients with epilepsy receive timely intervention. The opportunity for improvement is evident in many studies demonstrating that patients are not being offered efficacious interventions. For example, the duration of epilepsy before surgery is offered remains almost 20 years despite strong evidence of efficacy of epilepsy surgery and after the release of a guideline recommending referral (Haneef et al., 2010).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy data is lacking. In 2012, the Institute of Medicine released <em>Epilepsy across the Spectrum: Promoting Health and Understanding</em>, detailing epilepsy research disparities and highlighting specific areas where further research is needed, including the extent of epilepsy, consequences, comorbid conditions and outcomes of epilepsy (England et al., 2012). The following statistics only touch on the magnitude of epilepsy given lack of research and stigma: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It is estimated 2.2 million people in the United States are diagnosed with epilepsy, and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the United States annually (England et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Epilepsy prevalence might be underestimated because of underreporting associated with repercussions and stigma in disclosing epilepsy (Kobau et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Common comorbidities among people with epilepsy include somatic (i.e., fractures, asthma, diabetes, and heart disease), neurological (i.e., stroke, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, chronic pain), and mental health conditions (i.e., mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, anxiety disorders, suicidality) (England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>It is estimated the number of people with epilepsy who die of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) range from 1 of every 10,000 who are newly diagnosed to 9 of every 1,000 candidates for epilepsy surgery (England et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>People with epilepsy are more likely to be unemployed or unable to work, have low annual household incomes, be obese and physically inactive, and to smoke (England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>People with epilepsy have poorer overall health status, impaired intellectual and physical functioning, a greater risk for accidents and injuries, and negative side effects from seizure medications (Fountain et al., 2011; England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>It is estimated the annual direct medical cost of epilepsy in the United States is $9.6 billion. This estimate does not include community service costs or indirect costs from losses in quality of life and productivity (England et al., 2012). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunities for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Additional data on opportunities for improvement and gaps in care specific to the epilepsy measures can be located in the updated epilepsy measures. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A review of 261 patient responses using the PatientsLikeMe survey system indicated a gap remains between recommended care detailed in the 2009 epilepsy measurement set and the care delivered to patients with epilepsy (Wicks &amp; Fountain, 2012). </li>
    <li>The Institute of Medicine noted several gaps in care and opportunities for improvement, including 1) timely referrals and access to treatments, 2) epilepsy care and prevention, 3) education of persons with epilepsy and their families, and 4) the stigma of epilepsy (England et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Surgery continues to be heavily underutilized as a treatment for epilepsy, with significant disparities by race and insurance coverage (Englot et al., 2012). </li>
