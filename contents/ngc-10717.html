Major Recommendations

<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of certainty (<strong>High-Low</strong>) and the grade of recommendations (<strong>Strong-Against</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Recommendation and Rationale</span></strong></p>
<p>Using the level of certainty categories as a guide (see definitions below), the 2014 Panel judged with moderate certainty that there is no association between dental procedures and the occurrence of prosthetic joint infections (PJIs). The 2014 Panel made this judgment on the basis of the following 2 considerations. The first was consistency between results, in that the results of 3 of 4 studies failed to show an association between dental procedures and PJI, and the results of the fourth study showed a protective effect of dental procedures on PJI. The second was that although the number of studies was limited, it is unlikely that the results of the additional studies would have changed the conclusion. The 2014 Panel made the assumption that the evidence regarding hip and knee joint infections can be extrapolated to all joints on the basis of the morphologic and physiological characteristics of the tissues involved. This extrapolation is necessary for clinical relevance because, to the Panel's knowledge knowledge, no studies have been published addressing the relationship between dental treatment and infections of other types of prosthetic joints. Using the American Dental Association's (ADA's) methods for generating clinical recommendation statements (see the "Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations" field), when there is <em>moderate</em> certainty of no association, the strength of the recommendation is <em>against</em>. The term <em>against</em> means that evidence suggests not implementing this intervention or discontinuing ineffective procedures (see the definitions for "Strength of the Recommendation" below).</p>
<p>On the basis of this rationale, the 2014 Panel makes the following clinical recommendation: In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection. The practitioner and patient should consider possible clinical circumstances that may suggest the presence of a significant medical risk in providing dental care without antibiotic prophylaxis, as well as the known risks of frequent or widespread antibiotic use.</p>
<p>This report is intended to assist practitioners with making decisions about the prophylactic use of antibiotics to prevent PJIs. The recommendations in this document are not intended to define a standard of care and rather should be integrated with the practitioner's professional judgment and the patient's needs and preferences.</p>

            <p>In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibodies are <em>not</em> recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection (PJI).</p>
            <p class="Note">For patients with a history of complications associated with their joint replacement surgery who are undergoing dental procedures that include gingival manipulation or mucosal incision, prophylactic antibiotics should only be considered after consultation with the patient and orthopedic surgeon.* To assess a patient's medical status, a complete health history is always recommended when making final decisions regarding the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>

            <p><strong>Clinical Reasoning for the Recommendation</strong></p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>There is evidence that dental procedures are not associated with prosthetic joint implant infections. </li>
                <li>There is evidence that antibiotics provided before oral care do not prevent prosthetic joint implant infections. </li>
                <li>There are potential harms of antibiotics including risk for anaphylaxis, antibiotic resistance, and opportunistic infections like <em>Clostridium difficile</em>. </li>
                <li>The benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis may not exceed the harms for most patients. </li>
                <li>The individual patient's circumstances and preferences should be considered when deciding whether to prescribe prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="Note">*In cases where antibiotics are deemed necessary, it is most appropriate that the orthopedic surgeon recommend the appropriate antibiotic regimen and when reasonable, write a prescription.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>In 2012, a panel of experts representing the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American Dental Association (ADA) (the 2012 Panel) published a systematic review and accompanying clinical practice guideline (see the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the <a href="/content.aspx?id=39406" title="Guideline #9564" target="_blank">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline on prevention of orthopaedic implant infection in patients undergoing dental procedures</a>). See also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the 2012 guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Because the 2012 Panel conducted a comprehensive search of the biomedical literature and screened the results of the search according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, the 2014 Panel chose to use the literature selected by the 2012 Panel as the foundation of this clinical practice guideline. In addition, the 2014 Panel updated the literature search and screening process to identify additional evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>The 2014 Panel conducted an updated literature search in February 2014 by using the identical search strategy as that described in Appendix IV of the 2012 Panel's article to identify any articles published since the previous search was conducted in 2011. The updated literature search and full-text review process compelled the 2014 Panel to review the list of articles excluded at the full-text stage in the 2012 Panel's manuscript (see Table 58 in Appendix III in the 2012 Panel's article) for the reason that they were retrospective. According to the study selection criteria, only retrospective case series were eligible for exclusion; therefore, the 2014 Panel judged that 2 additional case-control studies that had been rejected should be included in the evidence. Records were screened independently and in duplicate. The articles that were excluded at the full-text stage are shown in eTable 4 in the original guideline document with reasons for the exclusions.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The 2014 Panel assessed each identified study according to the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme case-control critical appraisal tool and then summarized the body of evidence to determine the level of certainty in the effect estimate and corresponding strength of the recommendation (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields). See the "Evidence Review" section of the original guideline document for more details on the included studies.</p>
<p>eTable 5 in the original guideline document shows the critical appraisal results for each of the four included studies.</p>
<p>The level of certainty in the effect estimate is judged as high, moderate, or low, according to a grading system amended from the <em>ADA Clinical Practice Guidelines Handbook: 2013 Update</em> (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The level of certainty refers to the probability that the 2014 Panel's assessment of the effect estimate is correct. The criteria for assessment include several components of the evidence, including the number of studies, number of participants, methodological quality, believability of results, applicability of the results to populations of interest, and consistency of findings across studies.</p>
<p>The 2014 Panel did not conduct a meta-analysis because a meta-analysis of observational studies can produce precise, but possibly spurious, estimates of risk owing to the effects of confounding.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>In 2012, a panel of experts representing the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American Dental Association (ADA) (the 2012 Panel) published a systematic review and accompanying clinical practice guideline (see the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the <a href="/content.aspx?id=39406" title="Guideline #9564" target="_blank">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline on prevention of orthopaedic implant infection in patients undergoing dental procedures</a>). See also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the 2012 guideline document. The 2012 Panel initially considered 222 questions concerning the relationship between dental procedures, bacteremia (as an intermediate outcome), and the risk of developing a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) as a clinical end point. The 2012 Panel published a comprehensive evidence-based guideline. The release of this guideline was followed by calls to the ADA Member Service Center hotline requesting additional clarification, which indicated that this guideline was 1 of the top 2 issues of concern to dental practitioners. Therefore, the ADA's Council on Scientific Affairs convened a panel of experts (the 2014 Panel) to provide dental professionals with a more specific and practical set of guidelines.</p>
<p>The 2014 Panel considered the direct evidence linking a PJI with a dental procedure but did not reevaluate intermediate outcomes, including bacteremia from manipulation of oral mucosa. The 2014 Panel addressed the following clinical question: For patients with prosthetic joints, is there an association between dental procedures and PJI, and, therefore, should systemic antibiotics be prescribed before patients with prosthetic joint implants undergo dental procedures?</p>

Potential Harms

<div class="content_para"><p>The following considerations contribute to the argument against antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Antibiotic Resistance</span></strong></p>
<p>There is a long-standing and increasing concern that repeated exposure to antibiotics is a risk factor for the development of resistant bacterial species (for example, penicillin-resistant streptococci).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adverse Drug Reactions</span></strong></p>
<p>Although there are no data regarding the risk of developing a drug reaction from 1 dose of amoxicillin prescribed to prevent a distant site infection such as prosthetic joint infection (PJI), older data involving prophylaxis regimens that included intramuscular injections and multiple oral doses suggest that more people who are given antibiotic prophylaxis would experience drug reactions from penicillin-type drugs&mdash;some of which may be fatal&mdash;than would be prevented from developing PJI. Of all allergens, penicillin is the most frequent medication-related cause of anaphylaxis in humans, and its use is the cause of approximately 75% of fatal anaphylaxis cases in the United States each year. Other potential antibiotic-associated adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. There also is an increased risk of experiencing adverse reactions with increasing patient age (that is, in patients 70 years or older), which is compounded by the increased frequency of arthroplasty in older patient cohorts.</p>
<p>Prolonged treatment with antibiotics is associated with infections secondary to changes in the gastrointestinal microbial flora, which includes that involved in the development of oral thrush. For example, <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection potentially can cause pseudomembranous colitis after patients are prescribed antibiotics to treat other infections. Recognizing that a single dose of antibiotics for prophylaxis of PJI is unlikely to cause a <em>C difficile</em> infection, comprehensive dental care often involves multiple appointments over a short period. In addition, patients may have taken antibiotics for other medical conditions in the past, increasing their risk of experiencing changes in the gastrointestinal flora. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that annually there are approximately 250,000 people with <em>C difficile</em> infections that require hospitalization or already affect hospitalized patients, resulting in 14,000 deaths per year. Investigators have identified clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as the inducing agents.</p></div>
