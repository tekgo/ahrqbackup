<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Systematic Literature Review</strong></span></p>
<p>American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are based on systematic reviews of the literature. A protocol for each systematic review defines parameters for a targeted literature search. Additional parameters include relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature identified. The protocol for this guideline was reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee's Thoracic Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG).</p>
<p>In 2007, the ASCO and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) published a joint guideline on adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy for stage I to IIIA resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CCO recently updated the systematic review on adjuvant chemotherapy, bringing it current to January 2016, and expanded the search strategy to include recent trials of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. That CCO systematic review and accompanying guideline recommendations serve as the basis for the adjuvant systemic therapy portion of this updated CCO/ASCO joint guideline. To improve the currency of the evidence base, a final literature search for any additional adjuvant systemic therapy trials published between January and June 2016 was conducted. </p>
<p>In 2015, ASCO endorsed the American Society for Radiation Oncology's (ASTRO's) evidence-based guideline on adjuvant radiation therapy in locally advanced NSCLC, with a systematic review that was current to March 2013. The ASTRO systematic review and accompanying guideline recommendations serve as the basis for the adjuvant radiation therapy portion of this guideline. To update the evidence base, a search for any additional adjuvant radiation therapy trials that were published between March 2013 and June 2016 was conducted. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></span></p>
<p>MEDLINE was searched using PubMed on June 21, 2016, using keywords and MeSH terms related to NSCLC and chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The complete literature search strategy used in the PubMed database is available in Data Supplement 1 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Reference lists of included articles were scanned for additional eligible citations. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Study Selection Criteria</strong></span></p>
<p>Publications with the following study designs were eligible for inclusion in the evidence base: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with or without meta-analyses, </li>
    <li>Phase III RCTs, </li>
    <li>Observational comparative studies based on the:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>National Cancer Database (NCDB), a large, prospectively acquired database that is gathered and maintained by the American College of Surgeons, the Commission on Cancer, and the American Cancer Society; </li>
        <li>SEER Program database, which collects registry data on cancer cases from various locations and sources throughout the United States (<a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/about" title="National Cancer Institute Web Site: About the SEER Program" target="_blank">seer.cancer.gov/about</a>). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Studies were considered for inclusion if they reported the following outcomes by tumor, node and metastasis (TNM) stage for comparisons of surgery alone versus surgery plus adjuvant systemic therapy or surgery plus radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy in the target population of patients with completely resected lung cancers (i.e., no macroscopic disease and uninvolved resection margins after surgery): </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Overall survival (OS), </li>
    <li>Disease-free survival (DFS), </li>
    <li>Adverse events. </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were not considered if they were: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Published only as an abstract; </li>
    <li>Trials of neoadjuvant (i.e., preoperative) chemotherapy; </li>
    <li>Trials of tegafur and uracil; </li>
    <li>Included patients with incomplete resections (i.e., had positive margins or macroscopic residual disease); </li>
    <li>Noncomparative study designs, including editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, and narrative reviews; </li>
    <li>Non-English language publications. </li>

<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by two American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewers in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by two staff reviewers and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the guideline and/or in Data Supplements 1 and 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study quality was formally assessed for the studies identified. Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer and included factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, etc. The risk of bias is assessed as "low," "intermediate," or "high" for most of the identified evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>

<p>Quality assessments conducted by Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) were adopted for this guideline and have been published elsewhere. Briefly, the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group (NSCLCCG) meta-analysis scored well on the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool because it included an a priori design and comprehensive literature search, provided characteristics of included studies, and reported on heterogeneity. However, the NSCLCCG authors did not assess the likelihood of publication bias or the quality of the included studies or state any conflicts of interest. In a quality assessment of individual phase III trials of chemotherapy included in the NSCLCCG meta-analysis and CCO review, studies were judged using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology to be at a moderate to high risk of bias due to lack of reporting of allocation concealment during randomization and lack of blinding. Two newer trials that were not included in the meta-analyses were also at risk for bias due to lack of blinding. The quality of evidence for trials of immunotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) was judged to be moderate due to inconsistency of comparators between trials. Evidence from National Cancer Database (NCDB) or Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) is considered low quality because of the retrospective, nonrandomized nature of the data, which increases the risk of bias in the estimated effect.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></span></p>
<p>This clinical practice guideline addresses two overarching clinical questions: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: disc;" start="1">
    <li>What is the benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with completely resected stage I to IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLCs)? </li>
    <li>What is the benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy in patients with completely resected stage I to IIIA NSCLCs? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expert Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, and patient/advocacy representation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. For this guideline product, the Co-Chairs selected additional members to assist in the development and review of the guideline drafts.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></span></p>
<p>The Expert Panel met on several occasions and corresponded frequently through e-mail; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs/Steering Committee along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence.* </p>
<p class="Note">*If Consensus Methods were used, then: The Expert Panel was supplemented by additional experts recruited to rate their agreement with the drafted recommendations as part of the consensus process. The entire membership of experts is referred to as the Consensus Panel. The Co-Chairs/Steering Committee and ASCO staff prepared a draft guideline for review and rating by the Consensus Panel.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software&trade;. This method helps Guideline Expert Panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Expert Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p>
<p>In addition, a guideline implementability review is conducted. Based on the implementability review, revisions were made to the draft to clarify recommended actions for clinical practice. Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias are provided with each recommendation (see the Methodology Supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>One study evaluated the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in a National Cancer Database (NCDB) data set of 25,267 patients who underwent complete resection from 2004 to 2011. Approximately 20% (4,996) received adjuvant chemotherapy, which was associated with significantly improved median survival and overall survival (OS) for all tumor size groups, from 3.1 to 7 cm, grouped by 1-cm intervals, within the T2 stage. </li>
    <li>Using the Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE) data to estimate absolute benefit, adjuvant chemotherapy raises 5-year survival from 64% up to 67% for stage IB, from 39% up to 49% for stage II, and from 26% up to 39% for stage IIIA disease extent. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the "Quality Assessment" and "Key Evidence" sections of the original guideline document for further details on benefits of specific recommendations.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In the Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation (LACE) meta-analysis of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the rate of overall grade 3 to 4 toxicity was 66% among 1,190 patients in four trials for which this information was available. With data from five trials, the rate of grade 4 toxicity was 32%. The most frequent toxicity was neutropenia (grade 3, 9%; grade 4, 28%); however, the rate was highly variable across trials, likely due to differing methods of surveillance and data collection. There were 19 chemotherapy-related deaths (0.9%) reported. </li>
    <li>The most commonly encountered adverse events with radiation therapy have previously been reported in a meta-analysis to be mild esophagitis, dysphagia, and odynophagia. In that study, cough and pneumonitis requiring steroid therapy were the most common pulmonary toxicities, radiation myelitis was reported in one patient, and no severe late complications were noted. Late complications were few, although analysis of this outcome was likely limited by the follow-up duration. The adverse effect of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on cardiac events has not been adequately studied. </li>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, providing adequate services in the face of limited resources, as well as the challenge of discriminating between multiple guideline products from various sources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
