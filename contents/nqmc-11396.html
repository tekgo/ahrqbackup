<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines state the following: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Arteriovenous (AV) fistulas (AVFs) have the lowest rate of thrombosis and require the fewest interventions, </li>
    <li>Cost of AV fistula use and maintenance is the lowest, </li>
    <li>Fistulas have the lowest rates of infection, and </li>
    <li>Fistulas are associated with the highest survival and lowest hospitalization rates. </li>
</ol>
<p>Indeed, a number of epidemiologic studies consistently demonstrate the reduced morbidity and mortality associated with greater use of AVFs for vascular access in maintenance hemodialysis.</p>
<p>As the accompanying literature review indicates, there are a growing number of studies reporting that creating AVF in some patients is less likely to be successful in the presence of certain comorbidities. In addition, certain patient groups may have less incremental benefit from an AVF relative to an AV graft. By adjusting the fistula rate for patient characteristics and comorbidities associated with low AV fistula success rates, this measure accounts for patients where a graft or even a catheter may be a more appropriate option.</p>
<p>This measure is intended to be jointly reported with Hemodialysis Vascular Access: Long-term Catheter Rate (see the related NQMC summary, <a href="/summaries/summary/51319" title="Measure Summary #11397" target="_blank">End stage renal disease [ESRD]: percentage of adult hemodialysis patient-months using a catheter continuously for three months or longer for vascular access</a>). These two vascular access quality measures, when used together, consider AVF use as a positive outcome and prolonged use of a tunneled catheter as a negative outcome. With the growing recognition that some patients have exhausted options for an AVF or have comorbidities that may limit the success of AVF creation, joint reporting of the measures accounts for all three vascular access options. The fistula measure adjusts for patient factors where fistula placement may be either more difficult or not appropriate and acknowledges that in certain circumstances an AV graft may be the best access option. This paired incentive structure that relies on both measures (standardized fistula rate [SFR], long-term catheter rate) reflects consensus best practice, and supports maintenance of the gains in vascular access success achieved via the Fistula First/Catheter Last Project over the last decade.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2014&ndash;December 2014 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility-level annual performance scores. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between-facility variation (&sigma;_b^2) and the within-facility variation (&sigma;_(t,w)^2) in the measure is determined. The inter-unit reliability (IUR) measures the proportion of the total variation of a measure (i.e., &sigma;_b^2 + &sigma;_(t,w)^2) that is attributable to the between-facility variation, the true signal reflecting the differences across facilities. The developer assessed reliability by calculating inter-unit reliability (IUR) for the annual performance scores. A small IUR (near 0) reveals that most of the variation of the measure between facilities is driven by random noise, indicating the measure would not be a good characterization of the differences among facilities, whereas a large IUR (near 1) indicates that most of the variation between facilities is due to the real difference between facilities.</p>
<p>The reliability of standardized fistula rate (SFR) calculation only included facilities with at least 11 patients during the entire year.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The IUR is 0.736 which indicates that about 74% of the variation in the annual SFR can be attributed to between-facility differences in performance (signal) and about 26% to the within-facility variation (noise).</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The result of IUR testing suggests a high degree of reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Validity was assessed using Poisson regression models to measure the association between facility level quintiles of performance scores and the 2014 standardized mortality ratio (SMR, NQF 0369) and 2014 standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR, NQF 1463). Facility-level performance scores were divided into quintiles (Q1 to Q5) and the relative risk (RR) of mortality (and hospitalization, separately) was calculated for each quintile, using the combined Q4 and Q5 as the reference group. Thus, a RR greater than 1.0 would indicate a higher RR of mortality or hospitalization, compared to the highest performance score quintiles.</p>
<p>In 2015, a vascular access technical expert panel (TEP) was convened to provide input on the development of access measures, and specifically input on exclusions for both catheter and fistula measures, and for fistula, risk adjustment factors to be considered. Ultimately, evaluation and selection of the clinical and patient risk factors for this measure was informed by the final TEP recommendations. The TEP recognized that while fistulas are preferred, an unintended consequence of a fistula measure that doesn't account for the patient's overall health status could harm patients by subjecting them to fistula surgery that is less likely to succeed or limit access to care for patients with more comorbidities. To accomplish this goal, the TEP discussed adjusting the measure for conditions or scenarios where a graft may be an acceptable or preferred alternative to a fistula. The candidate measure was reviewed and validated by the TEP in 2015.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Quintiles of the performance scores were defined as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Q1: 9.2% - less than 55.9% </li>
    <li>Q2: 55.9% - less than 62.0% </li>
    <li>Q3: 62.0% - less than 67.4% </li>
    <li>Q4*: 67.4% - less than 73.4% </li>
    <li>Q5*: 73.4% - less than 97.5% </li>
</ul>
<p>*Q4 and Q5 as reference</p>
<p>Results from the Poisson model indicated that the percent of patient-months with a fistula was significantly associated with the risks of mortality and hospitalization.</p>
<p>For the 2014 SMR, the RR of mortality increased as the performance measure quintile decreased from the reference group (combined Q4 and Q5) with the highest risk in quintile 1. For quintile 3, RR = 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.05; p = 0.003), quintile 2, RR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.07; p less than 0.001), and quintile 1, RR = 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.12; p less than 0.001).</p>
<p>Similarly for 2014 SHR, the RR of hospitalization increased as the performance measure quintile decreased from the reference group (combined Q4 and Q5) with the highest risk in quintile 1. For quintile 3, RR = 1.07 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.07; p less than 0.001), quintile 2, RR = 1.08 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.09; p less than 0.001), and quintile 1, RR = 1.11 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.11; p less than 0.001).</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>These results of the Poisson regression suggest the predictive relationship of lower fistula use with higher mortality and hospitalization, as measured by the respective standardized mortality and hospitalization rates, and compared to facilities with higher fistula use.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is a directly standardized percentage, in that each facility's percentage of autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) use is adjusted to the national distribution of covariates (risk factors) (with 'national' here referring to all-facilities-combined). The SFR for facility is an estimate of what the facility's percentage of AVF would equal if the facility's patient mix was equal to that of the nation as a whole. The measure is adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics based on a logistic regression model. This model includes the facility indicators and assumes that the regression coefficients of risk factors are the same across all facilities.
