<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)-eligible pregnant patients who have a collaborative conversation with their clinician about the risks and benefits of VBAC.</p>
<p>There is near-universal agreement that prenatal care is both beneficial and cost effective. Care designed to help bring healthy babies into the world is regarded as the highest of aspirations. Yet when examined critically, not all prenatal care can be shown to demonstrably improve maternal or neonatal health.</p>
<p>In 1989, the Expert Panel on the Content of Prenatal Care established guidelines on the timing and content of prenatal care, including a schedule consisting of fewer prenatal visits than traditional models provided. This reduced schedule of visits applied to women considered at low risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Timing and focusing prenatal visits at these intervals, along with providing designated education pieces at each visit, should serve to provide a more comprehensive and satisfying prenatal program than has existed in the past. </p>
<p>After consideration of the individual situation of the patient, VBAC is still a viable option for the majority, due to the high probability of successful vaginal delivery and the low rate of complications after trial of labor. This data should be discussed when counseling a patient.</p></div>
