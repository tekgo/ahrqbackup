Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 19 to 64 years of age during the measurement year with schizophrenia who were dispensed and remained on an antipsychotic medication for at least 80 percent of their treatment period.</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For people with schizophrenia, nonadherence to treatment with antipsychotics is common, and medication nonadherence is a significant cause of relapse (Olfson, Hansell, &amp; Boyer, 1997; Ascher-Svanum et al., 2010). Measuring antipsychotic medication adherence may lead to less relapse and fewer hospitalizations. Additionally, there is potential to lead to interventions to improve adherence and help close the gap in care between people with schizophrenia and the general population.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling psychiatric disorder that requires ongoing treatment and monitoring. Symptoms include hallucinations, illogical thinking, memory impairment and incoherent speech (American Psychiatric Association [APA], n.d.). Medication nonadherence is common and a major concern in the treatment of schizophrenia. Using antipsychotic medications as prescribed reduces the risk of relapse or hospitalization (Busch et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2002, the overall economic burden of schizophrenia was estimated to be $62.7 billion (Wu et al., 2005).</li>
    <li>The cost of care for people with schizophrenia and a history of prior relapse is three times higher than it is for people without a history of prior relapse (Ascher-Svanum et al., 2010).</li>
    <li>1.1 percent of adults in the United States have schizophrenia (Wu et al., 2005).</li>
    <li>Approximately 40 percent of hospital readmissions for patients with schizophrenia are attributed to nonadherence to antipsychotic medications (Weiden &amp; Olfson, 1995).</li>
    <li>Nearly half of people with schizophrenia take less than 70 percent of prescribed medication doses (Goff, Hill, &amp; Freudenreich, 2010).</li>
    <li>People with schizophrenia who discontinue their medications are twice as likely to experience a relapse in symptoms than those who continue their prescribed doses (Wunderink et al., 2007).</li>
    <li>Schizophrenia is a life-long mental illness that can be tough to treat and manage. Continuation of medication is important to reduce the number of relapse episodes and the need for hospitalization.</li>
