<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suspecting Frailty</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Opportunity Approach</strong></p>
<p>This kind of approach is used by health professionals. Some researchers have stated that listening to the patient's narrative and observing attitudes and emotion manifestations in clinical practice allows them to use intuition as a clinical method.</p>
<p>Clinicians suspect frailty syndrome using a clinical approach centered on listening (see box below), and therefore on the basis of their "narrative competence."</p>
<p>The opportunity approach can be used:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>By general practitioners within a primary care setting </li>
    <li>While referring to territorial and hospital specialists </li>
    <li>While referring to social and health services </li>

<p><strong>Screening of Target Population (Proactive Approach)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1A</strong>: Subjects over 75 should be always considered potentially frail. The suspicion of frailty can be based on observation and/or the patient's narrative, gathering information on health status and in particular on mobility, cognitive function, feeding and life habits, and sensory functions (<strong>evidence VI A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1B</strong>: Frailty can be suspected by healthcare professionals following an opportunity approach, and in particular:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Within a primary care setting </li>
    <li>While referring to specialists </li>
    <li>While referring to social and health services </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of mailed questionnaires, in terms of health policy, can allow a preliminary screening of the subjects at risk, before their direct clinical observation (<strong>evidence VI A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessing and Confirming Frailty</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: If frailty is suspected, the elder adult should be evaluated:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Using the SPPB test (see box below) </li>
    <li>Assessing loss of bodyweight, reduced physical activity and fatigue </li>
</ul>
<p>Assessment should be carried out by specifically trained professionals (<strong>evidence IV A</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>: Frailty in an older adult is confirmed if at least 3 of the following conditions are present:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Unintended weight loss (&ge;5% during the last 12 months) </li>
    <li>Rapid onset of fatigue in carrying out daily activities </li>
    <li>Reduced weekly frequency of physical activity </li>
    <li>Reduced gait speed (SPPB-gait test &le;3) </li>
    <li>Reduced muscular strength (SPPB-chair test &le;2)
    <p>(<strong>evidence IV A</strong>)</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analyzing Frailty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 4</strong>: Older adults in whom a frailty status has been identified should be assessed for:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Functional status (instrumental activities of daily living [IADLs]) </li>
    <li>Clinical status </li>
    <li>Cognitive function and psychological and affective status </li>
    <li>Pharmacological treatments </li>
    <li>Social, economic and environmental conditions </li>
    <li>Individual preferences, needs and values </li>
</ul>
<p>The assessment is included within the multi-professional group of primary care, relying on support from other healthcare professionals where necessary (<strong>evidence I A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Preventing Progression of Frailty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 5</strong>: Frailty is caused by several concomitant factors whose main aspect is the progressive reduction of muscular strength and bodyweight. Therefore, the main strategies to stabilize the system and control frailty are promoting physical activity and monitoring diet and bodyweight (<strong>evidence III A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 6</strong>: A subject defined frail should be regularly monitored and assessed within a primary care setting using specific tools for data collection.</p>
<p>The general practitioner should identify and coordinate all necessary actions to be taken to solve problems related to frailty, with support from other health professionals and social workers if needed (<strong>evidence II A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hospitalization of Frail People</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence is available confirming the effectiveness of discharge planning (DP) in limiting re-hospitalization, also specifically referring to frail subjects. The box below shows the principles of discharge planning as elaborated by the Department of Veterans' Affairs of the Australian Government (<a href="http://www.dva.gov.au/service_providers/dental_allied/discharge_planners/Documents/dprk.pdf" title="Department of Veterans Affairs Australia Web site">http://www.dva.gov.au/service_providers/dental_allied/discharge_planners/Documents/dprk.pdf</a>).</p>

                <li>Hospitalization should be considered an opportunity to identify frail subjects, to assess their global health, to define recommendations, and to start long-term actions coordinated by the general practitioner along with other health professionals. </li>
                <li>An effective DP is the standard for all patients receiving hospital care in National Health Services. </li>
                <li>A DP is a global approach to health that underlines the importance of continuity in healthcare provision and launches a strong message on preferring longitudinal care rather than episodic care. </li>
                <li>The DP is part of the care plan and includes both hospitalization and all therapies, treatments and care provided after discharge. </li>

</table>
<p><strong>Recommendation 7</strong>: A possible condition of frailty should be identified in older adults at admission to the hospital. This can be done gathering already known data and through suspected diagnosis and/or adequate diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>Hospitalized frail subjects should be taken in charge using the Geriatric Multidimensional Assessment method to avoid adverse events and progression to disability.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the personalized Discharge Planning should start at the moment of admission to hospital (<strong>evidence I A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing of Information and Bioethical Aspects</span></strong></p>
<p>Sharing information is consequent to the bioethical principles shown in the box below.</p>
<p><strong>Box. Bioethical Principles of Information</strong></p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" summary="Table: Bioethical Principles of Information">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">
            <p>Information on frailty should be managed with adequate means to protect patients' sensitive data. Consent should be obtained to disseminate data.</p>
            <p>Communicating and informing frail elder patients to obtain their consent can be difficult due to a possible progressive reduction of their cognitive competence and their relationship with families, which are often very present and actively participate relating with the caregivers.</p>
            <p>The difficulties raised by interacting with frail older adults should not affect the ethical integrity of the processes involving them, neither should elder patients be deprived of their rights, including the right of self-determination.</p>
            <p>Gathering data on frailty in a computer system results in the creation of a precious set of data that can be very useful to expand our knowledge on frailty, and to carry out epidemiological studies and clinical pharmacology trials.</p>
            <p>Considering the complexity of this specific subject, its ethical weight, and the legitimacy issues related to the transmission of data, all the recommendations included in the present guideline should be complemented with the ethical and deontological indications from the competent bioethical commission.</p>
