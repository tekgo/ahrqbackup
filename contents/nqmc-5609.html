<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Hospitals cannot provide adequate and appropriate language services to their patients if they do not create mechanisms to screen for limited English-proficient patients and record patients' preferred spoken language for health care. Standard practices of collecting preferred spoken language for health care would assist hospitals in planning for demand. Access to and availability of patient language preference is critical for providers in planning care. This measure provides information on the extent to which patients are asked about the language they prefer to receive care in and the extent to which this information is recorded.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>22.3 million U.S. residents (8.4%) have limited English proficiency (LEP). </li>
    <li>Between 1990 and 2000, the number with LEP grew by 53%. </li>
    <li>80% of hospitals reported treating LEP patients on a regular basis. </li>
    <li>Hispanics who do not speak English at home are less likely to receive all recommended health care services. </li>
    <li>Follow-up compliance, adherence to medications, and patient satisfaction are significantly lower for LEP populations than they are for English speaking patients. </li>
    <li>Language barriers are associated with less health education, worse interpersonal care, and lower patient satisfaction. </li>
    <li>LEP populations are less likely to receive preventative health services such as mammograms. </li>
    <li>Persons with LEP experience disproportionately high rates of infectious disease and infant mortality. </li>
    <li>Persons with LEP are more likely to report risk factors for serious and chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. </li>
    <li>Physicians who are unable to communicate effectively with their patients often compensate by engaging in costly practices such as: more diagnostic procedures; more invasive procedures; overprescribing medications. </li>
    <li>Language barrier between physicians and their patients are associated with a $38 increase in test charges and 20-minute longer emergency department (ED) stay. </li>
    <li>ED decision making behavior (e.g., diagnostic testing, admission, IV hydration) is more costly when non-English speaking patients did not receive care from bilingual physician or with an interpreter present. </li>
    <li>The average cost per interpretation for health maintenance organizations (HMOs) patients was $79 and the total cost per year was $279, a relatively small cost given total medical expenditures, and given improved patient utilization of preventive and primary care services that may reduce long-term medical costs. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The measure was pilot tested in one inpatient and in one outpatient care setting in two (2) large metropolitan hospitals October 2006.</p>
<p>The measure was used by the 10 grantee hospitals in the Speaking Together National Language Services Collaborative from November 2006 - May 2008. Ten (10) hospitals reported data monthly on 40,000 - 60,000 patients seen in inpatient and ambulatory care settings. Hospitals ranged in size from 11,500 - 44,000 admissions, included 2 children's hospitals and were comprised of both academic teaching and non-teaching community hospitals.</p>
<p>The measures specifications were revised based on the learning from the Speaking Together Collaborative and input from the participating hospitals.</p>
