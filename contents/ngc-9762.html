</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>A summary of the recommendations for the acute management of axis fractures is provided in Table 1 and the data supporting the recommendations in this section are provided in Table 2 (please refer to the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Fractures of the Odontoid</strong></p>
<p>There is no <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence on the management of patients with acute traumatic odontoid fractures. <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence exists indicating that the risk of nonunion of a type II odontoid fracture in patients &ge;50 years of age is 21 times greater than the incidence of nonunion for younger patients with a similar type II odontoid fracture. Therefore, consideration of surgical stabilization and fusion for type II odontoid fractures in patients &ge;50 years of age is recommended. Type I, II, and III odontoid fractures are often effectively managed with external cervical immobilization, with the understanding that the failure of external immobilization is significantly higher for type II odontoid fractures. Treatment of type II odontoid fractures with a cervical collar alone or traction followed by cervical collar immobilization may be undertaken but is associated with lower fracture union rates. <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence indicates that factors associated with nonunion of type II fractures include age, fracture displacement, secondary loss of reduction, and delays in treatment. Similarly, <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence suggests that a change in angulation of the type II odontoid fracture of &ge;5&deg; on lateral radiography taken at 2 weeks after immobilization in a halo device is associated with failure of fusion. Closed reduction of displaced type II odontoid fractures is associated with successful treatment with halo immobilization. Type II and III odontoid fractures should be considered for surgical fixation in patients with dens displacement of &ge;5 mm, comminution of the odontoid fracture (type IIA), and/or inability to achieve or maintain fracture alignment with external immobilization. The treatment of isolated type I odontoid fractures with cervical immobilization is recommended, resulting in fusion rates approaching 100%. Anterior and posterior surgical fixation and fusion of type II and III odontoid fractures have been reported with fusion rates exceeding 90% with low morbidity. The management of odontoid fractures in elderly patients is associated with increased failure rates, and higher rates of morbidity and mortality irrespective of the treatment offered.</p>
<p><strong>Traumatic Spondylolisthesis of the Axis</strong></p>
<p>There is no <strong>Class I</strong> or <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence in the literature addressing the management of traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis. <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence supports a variety of treatments for these injuries. The majority of Hangman fractures heal with 12 weeks of cervical immobilization with either a rigid cervical collar or a halo immobilization device. Surgical stabilization is an option in the treatment of Hangman fractures and is typically reserved for cases of severe angulation, disruption of the C2-C3 disk space, or inability to establish or maintain fracture alignment with external immobilization.</p>
<p><strong>Fractures of the Axis Body (Miscellaneous Axis Fractures)</strong></p>
<p>There is no <strong>Class I</strong> or <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence in the literature addressing the management of traumatic fractures of the axis body. <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence supports the use of external immobilization as the initial treatment strategy for the variety of traumatic fractures of the C2 body.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search from 1966 to 2011 was undertaken using Medical Subject Headings in combination with "spinal cord injury": "axis," "vertebrae," "fracture," and "human." A total of 1181 articles were identified. Those articles focusing on the clinical management of acute traumatic axis fractures were selected for review. The bibliographies of these articles were scanned for additional references to confirm completeness of the literature review. Relevant articles addressing the mechanism of injury or the biomechanics and radiology of the C2 vertebra were considered for inclusion in the scientific foundation of this document.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Forty-six articles not previously included in the original guidelines document were identified, reviewed, and classified using established methodology. Thirty-one articles described the management of odontoid fractures; 10 articles were focused on traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis; and 5 articles described the treatment of patients with miscellaneous axis fractures.</p></div>

<p>On occasion, the assessed quality of the study design was so contentious and the conclusions so uncertain that the guideline authors assigned a lower medical evidence classification than might have been expected without such a detailed review. In every way, adherence to the Institute of Medicine's criteria for searching, assembling, evaluating, and weighing the available medical evidence and linking it to the strength of the recommendations presented in this document was carried out.</p>
<p>Articles that did not achieve immediate consensus among the author group were discussed extensively until a consensus was reached. Very few contributions required extensive discussion.

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Halo immobilization is associated with a number of known complications, including but not limited to pin loosening, infection, cranial fracture, pressure sores, poor patient compliance, pulmonary issues, pneumonia, and restricted patient mobility. </li>
    <li>Perioperative complications, including death, may occur with surgical fixation and fusion, especially in the elderly. </li>
    <li>The ability of elderly patients to tolerate halo fixation immobilization has been questioned. Mortality rates as high as 26% with the use of the halo device have been reported. </li>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
