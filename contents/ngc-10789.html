<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Level A recommendations</strong>. Generally accepted principles for patient care that reﬂect a high degree of clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level B recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reﬂect moderate clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level C recommendations.</strong> Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances where consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.</p></div>

Searches of MEDLINE, MEDLINE InProcess and other nonindexed citations portion of MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database were performed. All searches were limited to English-language sources, human studies, and adults, from January 2011 to September 2014; searches were conducted on January 27, 2014, and September 3, 2014. Speciﬁc key words/phrases and inclusion criteria used in the searches are identified in the original guideline document under each critical question.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Classes of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least 2 committee members or methodologists; all Class I and Class II articles were graded by at least 2 methodologists. Each article was assigned a design class with design 1 representing the strongest study design and subsequent design classes (e.g., design 2, design 3) representing respectively weaker study designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic clinical reports, or meta-analyses (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, such as randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassiﬁcation biases, sample size, and generalizability. Using a predetermined process related to the study's design, methodological quality, and applicability to the critical question, articles received a ﬁnal Class of Evidence grade (i.e., Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles identiﬁed with fatal ﬂaws or that were ultimately not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade "X" and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the speciﬁc critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question for which it is being considered. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different Classes of Evidence as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-speciﬁc Classes of Evidence grading can be found in the Evidentiary Table in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Additionally, given recent changes to the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy development process, articles rated as Class I or II in the 2012 policy were also reviewed and graded by the committee methodologists using current grading forms (available at <a href="http://acep.org/clinicalpolicies" title="ACEP Web site">http://acep.org/clinicalpolicies</a>). </p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the print journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of <em>Annals of Emergency Medicine </em>and its editors. </li>
    <li>This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of patients with acute ischemic stroke but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. </li>
    <li>It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain adequate empirical data to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. </li>
    <li>This clinical policy is not intended to represent a legal standard of care for emergency physicians. Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic or management options available to the emergency physician. ACEP recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment and patient preferences. This guideline deﬁnes for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the critical questions addressed in this policy. </li>
