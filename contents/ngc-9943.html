Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least two subcommittee members for strength of evidence. The articles were classified by the subcommittee members into three classes of evidence on the basis of the design of the study, with design 1 representing the strongest design and design 3 representing the weakest design for therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic clinical reports, respectively (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, including but not necessarily limited to randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, external validity, generalizability, and sample size. Articles received a final grade (Class I, II, III) on the basis of a predetermined formula, taking into account the design and study quality (Appendix B in the original guideline document). Articles identified with fatal flaws or that were not relevant to the critical question received an "X" grade and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the specific critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different levels of grading as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-specific level of evidence grading may be found in the Evidentiary Table included at the end of the original guideline document.</p></div>

    <li>Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the print journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of <em>Annals of Emergency Medicine</em> and its editors. </li>
    <li>This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of patients with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. </li>
    <li>It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain enough quality information to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. </li>
    <li>Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic and management options that the emergency physician should consider. ACEP clearly recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment. Rather, this guideline defines for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the critical questions addressed in this policy. </li>
