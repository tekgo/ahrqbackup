Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The definitions for quality of evidence (<strong>strong</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, and <strong>very low</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>conditional</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition and Causes of Esophageal Eosinophilia</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Esophageal eosinophilia, the finding of eosinophils in the squamous epithelium of the esophagus, is abnormal and the underlying cause should be identified (<strong>Recommendation strong, evidence moderate</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Definition of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) and Diagnostic Criteria</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li>EoE is a clinicopathologic disorder diagnosed by clinicians taking into consideration both clinical and pathologic information without either of these parameters interpreted in isolation, and defined by the following criteria:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction </li>
        <li>Eosinophil-predominant inflammation on esophageal biopsy, characteristically consisting of a peak value of &ge;15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf) </li>
        <li>Mucosal eosinophilia is isolated to the esophagus and persists after a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) trial </li>
        <li>Secondary causes of esophageal eosinophilia excluded (see Table 2 in the original guideline document) </li>
        <li>A response to treatment (dietary elimination; topical corticosteroids) supports, but is not required for, diagnosis (<strong>Strong recommendation, low evidence</strong>). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Esophageal biopsies are required to diagnose EoE; 2&ndash;4 biopsies should be obtained from both the proximal and distal esophagus to maximize the likelihood of detecting esophageal eosinophilia in all patients in whom EoE is being considered (<strong>Recommendation strong, evidence low</strong>). </li>
    <li>At the time of initial diagnosis, biopsies should be obtained from the antrum and/or duodenum to rule out other causes of esophageal eosinophilia in all children and in adults with gastric or small intestinal symptoms or endoscopic abnormalities (<strong>Recommendation strong, evidence low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Challenges: PPI-Responsive Esophageal Eosinophilia and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>Proton-pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) should be diagnosed when patients have esophageal symptoms and histologic findings of esophageal eosinophilia, but demonstrate symptomatic and histologic response to proton-pump inhibition. At this time, the entity is considered distinct from EoE, but not necessarily a manifestation of GERD (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence low</strong>). </li>
    <li>To exclude PPI-REE, patients with suspected EoE should be given a 2-month course of a PPI followed by endoscopy with biopsies (<strong>Recommendation strong, evidence low</strong>). </li>
    <li>A clinical, endoscopic and/or histologic response to a PPI does not establish gastroesophageal reflux as the cause of esophageal eosinophilia. To determine whether reflux is contributing to esophageal eosinophilia, additional evaluation for GERD, as per standard clinical practice, is recommended. This may include ambulatory pH testing in selected cases (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Endpoints of Treatment in EoE</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="8">
    <li>The endpoints of therapy of EoE include improvements in clinical symptoms and esophageal eosinophilic inflammation. While complete resolution of symptoms and pathology is an ideal endpoint, acceptance of a range of reductions in symptoms and histology is a more realistic and practical goal in clinical practice (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence low</strong>). </li>
    <li>Symptoms are an important parameter of response in EoE, but cannot be used alone as a reliable determinant of disease activity and response to therapy, given that compensatory dietary and lifestyle factors can mask symptoms (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence moderate</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pharmacologic Treatments</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="10">
    <li>Topical steroids (i.e., fluticasone or budesonide, swallowed rather than inhaled, for an initial duration of 8 weeks) are a first-line pharmacologic therapy for treatment of EoE (<strong>Recommendation strong, evidence high</strong>). </li>
    <li>Prednisone may be useful to treat EoE if topical steroids are not effective or in patients who require rapid improvement in symptoms (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence low</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients without symptomatic and histologic improvement after topical steroids might benefit from a longer course of topical steroids, higher doses of topical steroids, systemic steroids, elimination diet, or esophageal dilation (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence low</strong>). There are few data to support the use of mast cell stabilizers or leukotriene inhibitors, and biologic therapies remain experimental at this time. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Dietary Treatments</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="13">
    <li>Dietary elimination can be considered as an initial therapy in the treatment of EoE in both children and adults (<strong>Strong recommendation, evidence moderate</strong>). </li>
    <li>The decision to use a specific dietary approach (elemental, empiric, or targeted elimination diet) should be tailored to individual patient needs and available resources (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence moderate</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinical improvement and endoscopy with esophageal biopsy should be used to assess response to dietary treatment when food antigens are either being withdrawn from or reintroduced to the patient (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence low</strong>). </li>
    <li>Gastroenterologists should consider consultation with an allergist to identify and treat extraesophageal atopic conditions, assist with treatment of EoE, and to help guide elemental and elimination diets (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Endoscopic Treatment</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="17">
    <li>Esophageal dilation, approached conservatively, may be used as an effective therapy in symptomatic patients with strictures that persist in spite of medical or dietary therapy (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence moderate</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients should be well informed of the risks of esophageal dilation in EoE including post-dilation chest pain, which occurs in up to 75 % of patients, bleeding, and esophageal perforation (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence moderate</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Natural History of EoE</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="19">
    <li>While knowledge of the natural history of EoE is limited, patients should be counseled about the high likelihood of symptom recurrence after discontinuing treatment due to the chronic nature of this disease (<strong>Recommendation strong, moderate evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Maintenance Therapy</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="20">
    <li>The overall goal of maintenance therapy is to minimize symptoms and prevent complications of EoE, preserve quality of life, with minimal long-term adverse effects of treatments (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence low</strong>). </li>
    <li>Maintenance therapy with topical steroids and/or dietary restriction should be considered for all patients, but particularly in those with severe dysphagia or food impaction, high-grade esophageal stricture and rapid symptomatic/histologic relapse following initial therapy (<strong>Recommendation conditional, evidence low</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) System</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence was either strong (further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate), moderate (further research is likely to change confidence in the estimate), low (further research is very likely to change confidence in the estimate), or very low (the estimate of the effect is very uncertain).</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations Using the Grade System</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations were either strong (desirable effects outweigh undesirable effects) or conditional (trade-offs are less certain).</p></div>

Potential Harms

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risks of Esophageal Dilation</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients should be well informed of the risks of esophageal dilation in esophageal eosinophilia (EoE) including post-dilation chest pain, which occurs in up to 75 % of patients, bleeding, and esophageal perforation. </li>
    <li>In two recent meta-analyses of esophageal dilation in EoE, the perforation rate for dilation was 0.3 %, similar to that quoted for esophageal dilation for other benign esophageal diseases. It is important to note, however, that this rate was achieved at academic centers experienced in performing esophageal dilation in patients with EoE. </li>
    <li>The most common risk of dilation in EoE is post-procedural chest pain, reported in almost three quarters of patients when asked about this symptom prospectively. Major bleeding defined by need for endoscopic hemostasis or blood product is rare (only 1 patient reported to date). </li>
