Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of in-hospital deaths per 1,000 discharges with esophageal resection for cancer, ages 18 years and older.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Esophageal resection is a complex cancer surgery. In 1996, 265 hospitals (19.7 percent of providers) performed at least 1 procedure. Of these hospitals, the mean number of procedures was 2; the median was 1; and the 90th and 95th percentiles were 4 and 6, respectively. In general, there are a moderate number of hospitals with lower volumes and a few hospitals with much higher volumes. Overall procedure volume was stable over the 2008 time period.</p>
<p>Several studies have noted that providers with higher volumes have lower mortality rates for the procedure than providers with lower volumes. This suggests that perhaps providers with higher volumes have some characteristics, either structurally or with regard to processes that influence mortality after this procedure. However, if these characteristics do indeed exist, what they are is unclear.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: The following caveats affect the validity of the indicator:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Confounding Bias</em>: Patient characteristics may substantially affect the performance of the indicator; risk adjustment is recommended. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature. </li>
    <li><em>Unclear Construct</em>: There is uncertainty or poor correlation with widely accepted process measures. The concern is theoretical or suggested, but no specific evidence was found in the literature. </li>
</ul></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The predicted value for each case is computed using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) logistic regression and covariates for age (in 5-year age groups), All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG) and Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC). The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., county or state). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population rate. The Smoothed Rate is the risk-adjusted rate shrunken to the volume specific rate and the prior year smoothed rate.</p>
