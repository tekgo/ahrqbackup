Description

<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 years of age or older with major depression or dysthymia who reached remission 6 months (+/- 30 days) after an index visit.</p>
<p>This measure applies to both patients with newly diagnosed and existing depression.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Depression is a common and treatable mental disorder. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that an estimated 6.6% of the United States adult population (14.8 million people) experiences a major depressive disorder during any given 12-month period. Additionally, dysthymia accounts for an additional 3.3 million Americans. In 2006 and 2008, an estimated 9.1% of U.S. adults reported symptoms for current depression (CDC, 2010). Persons with a current diagnosis of depression and a lifetime diagnosis of depression or anxiety were significantly more likely than persons without these conditions to have cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma and obesity and to be a current smoker, to be physically inactive and to drink heavily (Strine et al., 2008).</p>
<p>Depression is associated with higher mortality rates in all age groups. People who are depressed are 30 times more likely to take their own lives than people who are not depressed and five times more likely to abuse drugs (Joiner, 2010). Depression is the leading cause of medical disability for people aged 14 to 44 (Stewart et al., 2003). Depressed people lose 5.6 hours of productive work every week when they are depressed, fifty percent of which is due to absenteeism and short-term disability. </p>
<p>People who suffer from depression have lower incomes, lower educational attainment and fewer working days each year, leading to seven fewer weeks of work per year, a loss of 20% in potential income and a lifetime loss for each family who has a depressed family member of $300,000 (Smith &amp; Smith, 2010). The cost of depression (lost productivity and increased medical expense) in the United States is $83 billion each year (Greenberg et al., 2003). </p>
<p>The 2006 and 2008 CDC study estimated that the prevalence of current depression among adults in Minnesota was 5.9%, and the percent of Minnesotans who have a lifetime diagnosis of depression is 13% to 15%. In 2011, the suicide rate for Minnesotans was 12.4 per 100,000 population, increased from 2010 and 2009 rates which were 11.2 and 10.8, respectively (Heinen et al., 2013).</p></div>
