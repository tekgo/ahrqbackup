<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the total score for the "Practice/Organization" characteristics on the Site Self Assessment (SSA) Evaluation Tool.</p>
<p>Survey respondents are instructed to focus on their site's <em>current</em> extent of integration for patient and family-centered primary care, behavioral and mental health care, using a 1 to 10 scale, where higher scores represent more complex levels of integrated care. The 9 characteristics include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Organizational leadership for integrated care </li>
    <li>Patient care team for implementing integrated care </li>
    <li>Providers' engagement with integrated care ("buy-in") </li>
    <li>Continuity of care between primary care and behavioral/mental health </li>
    <li>Coordination of referrals and specialists </li>
    <li>Data systems/patient records </li>
    <li>Patient/family input to integration management </li>
    <li>Physician, team and staff education and training for integrated care </li>
    <li>Funding sources/resources </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: The "Practice/Organization" characteristics comprise one of two sections on the SSA Evaluation Tool, each of which has a possible total of 90 points (for a possible total of 180 points for the overall tool).</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There is growing knowledge and appreciation for the high prevalence of mental health conditions in the general adult population and, moreover, the impact that this issue is having on the primary care setting. The rationale or purpose to integration is to address the burden of chronic disease in the primary care setting (including depression and other mental health conditions) and the lack of access to mental health and behavioral health services, particularly in rural communities and for low-income or Medicaid-insured populations. Most primary care providers are simply swamped by patients who are either co-morbid with mental health and medical conditions or who have chronic medical conditions and are having trouble changing unhealthy or risky behaviors.</p>
<p>Improving care coordination and delivering integrated services for behavioral health and primary care is a key strategy to promote patient-centered care. Since 2006, Maine Health Access Foundation (MeHAF) has teamed up with an array of partners ranging from provider groups to insurers to patients to promote integrated care. To date, about 50% of all primary care practices in Maine provide some level of integrated behavioral health and primary care.</p>
<p>The Site Self Assessment (SSA) instrument will be used as one method to assess MeHAF sites' progress toward implementing patient/family centered integrated care, as well as to encourage on-site staff to reflect on the changes they have made and further changes needed to deliver all components of integrated care. It is especially designed to stimulate discussion and common understanding among interdisciplinary practice team members about the site's level of integrated care.</p></div>
