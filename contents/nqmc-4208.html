Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of current opioid addiction who were counseled regarding psychosocial and pharmacologic treatment options for opioid addiction within the 12 month reporting period.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Methadone and buprenorphine, in combination with psychosocial treatment, are effective in reducing drug use and supporting treatment retention. Until recently, their use had been limited due to regulatory requirements with capacity at approved facilities only able to meet the treatment needs of 15% of opioid dependent individuals. While the increased access to opioid agonist treatments has resulted in an increase in their use, a large number of clinicians have yet to gain eligibility to prescribe the appropriate medications. Moreover, among physicians with waivers to prescribe buprenorphine, 33% were not actively prescribing. Pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment should be routinely considered for all patients with opioid addiction, and patients should be informed of this option.*</p>

<p class="Note">*The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <u>verbatim</u> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure: </p>

<p class="Note">Empirically validated psychosocial treatment interventions should be initiated for all patients with substance use illnesses. (National Quality Forum [NQF]) </p>

<p class="Note">Pharmacotherapy should be recommended and available to all adult patients diagnosed with opioid dependence and without medical contraindications. Pharmacotherapy, if prescribed, should be provided in addition to and directly linked with psychosocial treatment/support. (NQF)</p>

<p class="Note">Maintenance treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is appropriate for patients with a prolonged history (greater than 1 year) of opioid dependence. (American Psychiatric Association [APA])</p>

<p class="Note">Maintenance treatment with naltrexone is an alternative strategy, although the utility of this strategy is often limited by lack of patient adherence and low treatment retention. (APA)</p>

<p class="Note">Psychosocial treatments are effective components of a comprehensive treatment plan for patients with an opioid use disorder. Behavioral therapies (e.g., contingency management), cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), psychodynamic psychotherapy, and group and family therapies have been found to be effective for some patients with an opioid use disorder. (APA)</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Federal and state regulations govern the use of methadone, levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM), and buprenorphine, the three opioids approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid dependence. (APA) [<em>Note: since the publication of the APA practice guideline, LAAM is no longer available in the United States for agonist maintenance treatment</em>.]</p>

<p class="Note">The American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Pain Society, and the American Society of Addiction Medicine issued a consensus statement to recognize and recommend definitions related to the use of opioids for the treatment of pain. They are as follows:</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Addiction</strong>: Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving.</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Physical Dependence</strong>: Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a drug class specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist.</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Tolerance</strong>: Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug's effects over time.</p>

<p class="Note">Addiction in the context of pain treatment with opioids is characterized by a persistent pattern of opioid misuse that may involve any or all of the following:</p>

<ul style="font-size:8pt;">
<li>Use of prescription opioids in an unapproved or inappropriate manner (such as cutting time-release preparations, injecting oral formulations, and applying fentanyl topical patches to oral or rectal mucosa)</li>
<li>Obtaining opioids outside of medical settings</li>
<li>Concurrent abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs</li>
<li>Repeated requests for dose increases or early refills, despite the presence of adequate analgesia</li>
<li>Multiple episodes of prescription "loss"</li>
<li>Repeatedly seeking prescriptions from other clinicians or from emergency rooms without informing prescriber, or after warnings to desist</li>
<li>Evidence of deterioration in the ability to function at work, in the family, or socially, which appears to be related to drug use</li>
<li>Repeated resistance to changes in therapy despite clear evidence of adverse physical or psychological effects from the drug</li>
<li>Positive urine drug screen—other substance use (cocaine, opioids, amphetamines or alcohol)</li>
<li>Meets DSM IV criteria for dependence on opioids (VA/DoD)</li>
</ul></div>
