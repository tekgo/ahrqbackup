<h2>Brief Abstract
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percent of patients with severe sepsis/septic shock AND an organism other than methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) who had Vancomycin (or Linezolid) discontinued within 72 hours following severe sepsis/septic shock identification.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Studies show that annually there are between 500,000 to one million cases of sepsis and severe sepsis in American hospitals. The annual mortality rate for these cases is between 15 and 30 percent or as many as 200,000 deaths. Many more patients suffer from permanent organ damage. The cost to society in dollars spent and lives lost prematurely is enormous. While there are many useful clinical interventions, research shows that they are applied inconsistently, if at all.</p>

<p> There is emerging evidence that the sickest patients should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics as soon as possible. This approach contrasts with treatment for less sick patients where, in general, we start with a narrow-spectrum antibiotic and broaden antibiotics if the patient does not respond.</p>

<p>With critically ill patients (those with severe sepsis or septic shock), clinicians cannot afford to under treat. Evidence suggests that the initial use of inadequate antibiotics nearly doubles the patients' mortality. As a result, the approach to antibiotic management in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock should be to start broad as soon as possible until culture results are available and the regimen can be narrowed.</p>

<p>Just what constitutes adequate broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is an ongoing controversy. Because pseudomonas is a common pathogen, the initial antibiotic therapy should include a medication against pseudomonas. Increasingly, methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA) is a cause of infection and one of the most common reasons for inadequate antibiotic therapy. In addition, a recent study suggests that 12 percent of MRSA infections were community-acquired and these patients lacked established risk factors. Because our ability to predict who is at risk for pseudomonas and MRSA is imprecise and because a patient’s mortality nearly doubles if infections with these organisms go untreated with the initial antibiotics, we recommend that unless the clinician is confident that the probability of pseudomonas or MRSA is zero, an antibiotic to treat pseudomonas and MRSA should be included in the initial antibiotic therapy for critically ill patients.</p>

<p>The potential downside of this strategy is enhanced antibiotic resistance. Though the data is limited, most experts believe that four days of antibiotics is unlikely to cause resistance. Resistance ensues when the drugs are continued for long periods of time. Among critically ill patients, the risk-benefit ratio thus strongly favors starting broad-spectrum antibiotics that includes anti-pseudomonal and MRSA drugs. These antibiotics should be discontinued if not needed when culture results are available.</p>

<p>At 96 hours, vancomycin should be discontinued if an organism other than MRSA or Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis (MRSE) is identified. In addition, the broad-spectrum antibiotics should be adjusted based on culture results. For both antibiotics, it is important to re-evaluate the patient. In a critically ill patient without a known organism, continued use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may be warranted.</p></div>

The costs for caring for patients with sepsis are projected to rise approximately 1.5 percent per year due to the aging U.S. population.</p></div>
