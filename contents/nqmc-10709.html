Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Seizures are common; every year, it is anticipated that up to 40,000 children in the United States will experience a first afebrile seizure (Hirtz et al., 2000). Neuroimaging is used in pediatric patients who have experienced a seizure to evaluate for structural brain abnormalities that may require surgical intervention or predispose to future seizures. Clinical guidelines maintain that children who present for evaluation after a first, generalized, afebrile seizure and meet low-risk criteria can be safely discharged without emergent neuroimaging, if follow-up can be assured (Gaillard et al., 2009; Hirtz et al., 2000). While widely available, computed tomography (CT) imaging for the evaluation of seizure in children has inferior resolution compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Gaillard et al., 2009; Hirtz et al., 2000) and is generally low-yield (Aprahamian et al., 2014; Garvey et al., 1998; Maytal et al., 2000; Sharma et al., 2003; Warden, Brownstein, &amp; Del Beccaro, 1997), suggesting overuse of this imaging modality. </p>
<p>This measure will address the overuse of CT of the brain among children evaluated for a first, afebrile seizure who return to neurologic baseline after the event. Overuse has been defined as any patient who undergoes a procedure or test for an inappropriate indication (Lawson et al., 2012). Imaging overuse subjects children to a number of risks (Malviya et al., 2000; Mathews et al., 2013; Pearce et al., 2012; Wachtel, Dexter, &amp; Dow, 2009). Children who undergo CT scans in early childhood tend to be at greater risk for developing leukemia, primary brain tumors, and other malignancies later in life (Mathews et al., 2013; Pearce et al., 2012). Children are also at risk for complications from sedation or anesthesia, which are often required for longer CT imaging sequences. These complications include compromised airway, hypoxia leading to central nervous system injury, and death. Additionally, CT overuse when a follow-up MRI study will be necessary creates cost burdens for the patient, as well as for payers.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Afebrile, Atraumatic Seizures: Prevalence and Incidence</em><br />
The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) "Practice Parameter: Evaluating a First Nonfebrile Seizure in Children" estimates that annually, between 25,000 and 40,000 children in the United States experience a first nonfebrile seizure (Hirtz et al., 2000; Hirtz et al., 2003). Seizures account for roughly 2% of visits to emergency departments at children's hospitals (Martindale, Goldstein, &amp; Pallin, 2011).</p>
<p><em>Afebrile, Atraumatic Seizure Pathology and Severity</em><br />
In general, a seizure will involve abnormal movements or changes in behavior that occur as a result of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain (Duvivier &amp; Pollack, 2009). A generalized seizure is associated with altered consciousness because abnormal electrical activity involves all or large parts of the brain. The expected overall recurrence rate after a first unprovoked seizure is around 50%, with a minority of children going on to experience multiple recurrent seizures (Hirtz et al., 2003).</p>
<p><em>Burdens of Overuse of Imaging in Afebrile, Atraumatic Seizures</em><br />
The literature offers many examples of the potential risks associated with overuse of imaging. Chief among these are risks related to radiation (Mathews et al., 2013; Pearce et al., 2012), sedation and/or anesthesia (Malviya et al., 2000; Wachtel, Dexter, &amp; Dow, 2009), and intravenous contrast media (Zo'o et al., 2011). Cost is also an issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Radiation-Related Burden and Risk</span>. Radiation exposure associated with computed tomography (CT)-imaging introduces the possibility of chronic health risks related to malignancies sustained from radiation effects (Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez et al., 2009; Mathews et al., 2013; Pearce et al., 2012). Radiosensitive organs&mdash;including the brain, bone marrow, lens of the eye, and thyroid gland&mdash;can be exposed to radiation during CT of the head (Papadakis et al., 2011). In children younger than 5 years of age, about 20% of the active bone marrow is in the cranium, compared with 8% in adults (Cristy, 1981). CT-based radiation dose for pediatric patients is highly problematic because developing cellular structures and tissues of children are significantly more radiosensitive than those of adults; children, therefore, will be at substantially elevated risk for malignancy (Hayes et al., 2012).</p>
<p>To conduct imaging studies with radiation dosing that is appropriate for children, many facilities follow policies and protocols using the concept of ALARA &mdash;As Low As Reasonably Achievable. ALARA principles deem any additional radiation beyond the minimum needed for interpretable images both detrimental and non-efficacious (American College of Radiology [ACR], 2009). Professional practice and patient advocacy groups, including the ACR, the AAN, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), have developed and promoted ALARA protocols and policies; these guidelines support the use of CT imaging only when clinically indicated in children, decreasing the risk of harm from radiation. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sedation and Anesthesia-Related Burden and Risk</span>. Some children will require sedation to ensure minimal movement during CT studies. Use of sedation is necessary to avoid motion artifacts, which invariably occur if the child moves during image acquisition, thus interfering with image quality. Motion artifacts sometimes undermine imaging quality to the point of rendering images unreadable. In the case of CT imaging, this may result in additional radiation exposure to obtain images sufficient for interpretation. Although the sedation used for pediatric imaging has been identified as low risk, it does have potential attendant complications (Cravero et al., 2006; Malviya et al., 2000). Levels of sedation are on a continuum from minimal anxiolysis (administration of an anxiety reduction agent) to deep sedation, in which the patient can be roused only via vigorous stimuli (Arthurs &amp; Sury, 2013). Compared with minimal sedation, moderate and deep sedation carry a greater risk of airway compromise, hypoxia resulting in central nervous system injury, and death (Cravero et al., 2006). </p>
<p>In certain instances, sedation may not be sufficient, and anesthesia will be required to complete imaging. Anesthesia includes administration of medication to the extent that there is some degree of respiratory suppression and potential for cardiac depression; the patient cannot be roused by external stimuli or commands (Arthurs &amp; Sury, 2013). Administration of anesthesia raises risks related to the process of intubation for respiratory support. These risks include dental trauma; airway edema (swelling of the windpipe); vocal cord spasm or injury; regurgitation of stomach contents with subsequent aspiration (inhalation) pneumonia; injury to arteries, veins, or nerves; alterations in blood pressure; and/or irregular heart rhythms (Society for Pediatric Anesthesia, 2014). The most severe risks, though rare, include brain damage and death (Society for Pediatric Anesthesia, 2014). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intravenous Contrast-Related Burden and Risk</span>. During the course of CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, intravenous (IV) contrast media may be used to enhance visualization of vascular structures and provide important information about neurologic anatomy. It is possible a child may experience an allergic reaction to IV contrast or subcutaneous fluid leakage (extravasation) during administration of IV contrast. IV contrast administration also includes the risk of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) (Bansal et al., 2014; Zo'o et al., 2011). Children with poor kidney function are at greater risk for developing CIN and, in rare cases, will develop renal failure requiring dialysis. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-Related Burden</span>. Overuse of imaging is costly and places additional strain on an already heavily burdened health care system (Callaghan et al., 2014). As an example, charges for a CT of the brain can be as much as $2,000 and can vary substantially by region of the country. In addition, the likelihood that neuroimaging will result in the identification of clinically important structural abnormalities in this patient population is low. Incidental findings, however, may require follow-up testing with associated charges and potential complications (Lumbreras, Donat, &amp; Hern&aacute;ndez-Aguado, 2010; Rogers et al., 2013). </p>
<p><em>Performance Gap</em><br />
The low yield of neuroimaging studies in children with seizure presenting to emergency departments has been documented repeatedly (Warden, Brownstein, &amp; Del Beccaro, 1997; Garvey et al., 1998; Hirtz et al., 2000; Maytal et al., 2000; Gaillard et al., 2009; Aprahamian et al., 2014). The AAN, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), and the ACR generally favor MRI over CT for the evaluation of children who require neuroimaging after a first afebrile seizure, due to the superior resolution and lack of radiation associated with MRI (Hirtz et al., 2000; Gaillard et al., 2009; Dory et al., 2012). The AAN and ILAE also provide guidance on specific features of childhood seizures that increase or decrease the likely benefit of obtaining neuroimaging studies at all (Gaillard et al., 2009; Hirtz et al., 2000). </p>
<p><em>Drivers of Overuse</em><br />
Seizures can be stressful events that may prompt a parent to seek the assistance of a health care provider, at times emergently. A seizure generates considerable distress and concern for family members and caregivers who witness it (Shinnar &amp; Pellock, 2002; Baumer et al., 1981). Some providers may feel pressured by the parent to order imaging despite a lack of benefit (Dory et al., 2012). This circumstance has a close parallel with parents who seek antibiotics for a child who has viral respiratory symptoms. In these circumstances, the provider may deviate from established practice guidelines to placate the parent. In recent decades, this phenomenon has reached such wide-spread prominence as to prompt multidisciplinary initiatives targeted at fostering discussion and identifying common practices that should be questioned by parents and providers (AAP, 2013). An ongoing dialogue between providers and parents about the risks and benefits of CT imaging continues to be a key feature of minimizing overuse in the setting of seizures. </p>
<p>The practice of defensive medicine is another reason an imaging study may be ordered. Physicians may be uncomfortable facing uncertainty regarding the etiology of seizure in children they are evaluating and treating. Assurance behaviors (e.g., ordering additional tests) are expected when a malpractice-sensitive physician is faced with a potentially worrisome condition that can cause the symptom in question (Carrier et al., 2013). In a survey of physicians from six specialties at high risk of liability, emergency physicians ordered more unnecessary diagnostic tests than clinicians from any other specialty (Studdert, et al. 2005). Physicians practicing in the emergency department have the added challenge of limited access to detailed medical records, which increases uncertainty about prior evaluation of patients who are referred from an out-of-network provider or hospital. Overuse of neuroimaging is a potential result.</p>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability</strong><br />
This measure was tested using inter-rater reliability (IRR) of medical record data, as described below.</p>
<p><em>Abstracted Medical Record Data</em>. Medical record data were obtained through HealthCore, Inc., an independent subsidiary of Anthem, Inc., the largest health benefits company/insurer in the United States. HealthCore owns and operates the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD), a longitudinal database of medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment information for members from 14 geographically diverse Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield (BCBS) health plans in the Northeast, South, West, and Central regions of the United States, with members living in all 50 states. The HIRD includes automated computerized claims data and enrollment information for approximately 60 million lives with medical enrollment, over 37 million lives with combined medical and pharmacy enrollment information, and 16 million lives with outpatient laboratory data from the BCBS licensed plans.</p>
<p>This measure belongs to the Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC) Overuse of Imaging for the Evaluation of Children with Headache or Seizures measures collection. As part of the initial sampling strategy for testing multiple measures in this collection, approximately 2.1 million children, ages 6 months through 17 years old, were identified in the HIRD for the study's 2012 measurement year. Of these, a cohort of children with diagnosis codes for headaches and seizures were identified (57,748). Members who did not have continuous eligibility during the 2011 and 2012 calendar years were excluded, narrowing the group to 36,985. Specifically for this measure, administrative claims were used to identify children, ages 1 through 17 years old, who were diagnosed with a first generalized afebrile, atraumatic seizure (4,385, 11.9%). From this group, 532 children (12.1%) were identified as having computed tomography (CT) imaging. After applying claims denominator exclusions, 296 children (55.6%) remained eligible for medical record review. </p>
<p>Among the children eligible for the denominator based on claims, providers associated with the eligible children's visits were identified; the final sampling population consisted of 218 children (73.6%) who were linked to a provider with available contact information. Once subjects were identified, patient medical records were requested from health care providers; records were sent to a centralized location for data abstraction. To ensure an adequate number of cases to test the feasibility of this measure, a target sample of 200 abstracted charts was set. </p>
<p>Trained medical record abstractors reviewed paper copies of the medical records and entered data collected into a password-protected database. To help ensure consistency of data collection, the medical record abstractors were trained on the study's design and presented with a standardized data collection form designed to minimize the need to make subjective judgments during the abstraction process. In addition, data were entered onto forms, which were subsequently scanned and reviewed through a series of quality checks.</p>
<p>Although 200 charts were requested for the target sample, a total of 89 charts were obtained from provider offices and health care facilities. These charts were reviewed for the presence of denominator exclusions that were not present in claims. There were 33 children (37.1%) with documentation of a condition that met denominator exclusion within the chart, resulting in a total of 56 children (62.9%) who met denominator criteria for this measure. Among patients eligible for the denominator, CT imaging was obtained without a documented indication for 44 children (78.6%).</p>
<p><em>Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR)</em>. Reliability of medical record data was determined through re-abstraction of patient record data to calculate the IRR between abstractors. Broadly, IRR is the extent to which the abstracted information is collected in a consistent manner. Low IRR may be a sign of poorly executed abstraction procedures, such as ambiguous wording in the data collection tool, inadequate abstractor training, or abstractor fatigue. For this measure, the medical record data collected by three abstractors was individually compared with the data obtained by a senior abstractor. IRR was determined by calculating both percent agreement and Cohen's kappa statistic. </p>
<p>Of the 89 medical records received for chart review, 13 records (14.6%) were reviewed for IRR. IRR was assessed by comparing the abstractor agreement with a senior abstractor on 16 questions included in the chart abstraction form for this measure. Overall, abstractor agreement was 100%; the kappa statistic was 1.0, indicating a perfect level of agreement was achieved. Given this evidence, the data elements needed for calculation of the measure can be abstracted from medical records with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><br />
The face validity of this measure was established by a national panel of experts and parent representatives for families of children with headaches or seizures convened by Q-METRIC. The Q-METRIC panel included nationally recognized experts in the area of imaging children, representing general pediatrics, pediatric radiology, pediatric neurology, pediatric neurosurgery, pediatric emergency medicine, general emergency medicine, and family medicine. In addition, face validity of this measure was considered by experts in state Medicaid program operations, health plan quality measurement, health informatics, and health care quality measurement. In total, the Q-METRIC imaging panel included 15 experts, providing a comprehensive perspective on imaging children and the measurement of quality metrics for states and health plans. </p>
<p>The Q-METRIC expert panel concluded that this measure has a high degree of face validity through a detailed review of concepts and metrics considered to be essential to the appropriate imaging of children. Concepts and draft measures were rated by this group for their relative importance. This measure received an average score of 7.6 (with 9 as the highest possible score).</p>
