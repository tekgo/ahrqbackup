<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This population-based measure is used in primary care settings to assess the percent of clinically significant depression* patients who, within one month of last New Episode Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)**, are on an antidepressant*** and/or in psychotherapy****.</p>

<p>This measure assesses use of evidence-based guidelines (medication and/or psychotherapy) for treatment of clinically significant depression.</p>

<p>Both medications and certain psychotherapies have been found to be better than usual care (Schulberg HC et al., Arch Gen Psychiatry 1998; Schulberg HC et al., Gen Hosp Psychiatry 2002).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The universe of patients (denominator) for this measure is limited to the last 12 months, This enables monitoring of changes in performance in the last 12 calendar months on a continuing basis.</p>

<p class="Note">*Clinically significant depression = Patient with a diagnosis of depression and a New Episode PHQ of 10 or greater</p>

<p class="Note">**New Episode PHQ = The PHQ measurement item that is used to track the PHQ results at the beginning of a depressive episode</p>

<p class="Note">***For a list of specified antidepressants, see the &quot;Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions&quot; field in the Complete Summary.</p>

<p class="Note">****Refers to any type of psychotherapy for which an evidence base exists in the literature for the treatment of acute major depression (e.g., Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy [CBT], Interpersonal Psychotherapy [IPT], or Problem-Solving Therapy [PST])</p>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Depression is one of the most common chronic illnesses in the United States, with a one-year prevalence rate of 5-6 percent. Depression is twice as common in women as in men; it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 10 percent of men will have an episode of major depression at some point in their lives. Depression often takes a severe toll on the physical and social functioning of those who suffer from it. According to one study using the SF-36 quality-of-life measure, depression impaired social functioning more than any other chronic illness, including arthritis, diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), angina, and hypertension; and impaired physical functioning more than any other chronic condition except the cardiac illnesses.</p>

<p>Depression care in the United States is even more fragmented than care of other chronic illnesses, creating a major gap between the recommended guidelines for care and actual care. It is estimated that only 19 percent--fewer than 1 in 5--of people with depression who see their primary care provider receive appropriate, guideline-based care.</p>

<p>Improving depression care is not only a matter of meeting the typical challenges of providing good chronic illness care--following people over time rather than responding to acute episodes, providing systematic follow-up to ensure that patients adhere to treatment plans, and so on. In addition, depression care brings its own complex set of challenges, ranging from underdiagnosis to financial disincentives for providers to special treatment requirements because the underlying nature of the illness frequently undercuts patients' ability to be effective managers of their own care.</p>

<p>This measure is one of 8 additional recommended measures in the HRSA Health Disparities Collaborative for Depression; participants choose to track at least one of these measures. Participants also track 5 measures for the Depression Collaborative.</p></div>
