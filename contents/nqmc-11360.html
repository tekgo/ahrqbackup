Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine studies with a diagnosis of low back pain on the imaging claim for which the patient did not have prior claims-based evidence of antecedent conservative therapy.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is one of the most common health problems in the United States (Bradley, 2007). It is estimated that the prevalence of low back pain in North America at any given time is 5.6% (Loney &amp; Stratford, 1999). According to the American College of Radiology (ACR), uncomplicated acute low back pain is a benign, self-limited condition that warrants no imaging studies (Bradley, 2007). Despite consensus that there is little value in diagnostic imaging for acute low back pain, significant practice variation exists for imaging resources, including x-ray imaging, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scans, and ultrasound imaging (Modic et al., 2005). Such use has important cost implications, largely due to the high cost of imaging studies and specialty referrals (Rao et al., 2002). The cost of evaluating and treating acute low back pain runs into billions of dollars annually, not including time lost from not working (Luo et al., 2004).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>During the measure development process, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) completed quantitative testing of the measure's specifications, including evaluation of the measure's scientific acceptability and feasibility of implementation by a Technical Expert Panel. A dry run, evaluating measure performance at each facility eligible for public reporting, was performed prior to measure implementation; no major stakeholder concerns were raised about the specifications, feasibility, or usability at that time. The measure was first endorsed by the National Quality Forum in 2008; its endorsement was removed in 2017.</p>
<p>CMS continues to monitor stakeholder inquiries for concerns about measure calculation or scientific acceptability; feedback received through this vehicle can feed into the measure update cycle, as is appropriate. In fall 2015, CMS completed a robust evaluation of the measure's importance, scientific acceptability (including reliability and validity), feasibility, and usability and use.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Inclusions</strong> <br />
Number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine studies with a diagnosis of low back pain (LBP) on the imaging claim</p>
<p><em>Initial Patient Population</em>: This measure applies only to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in original, fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare who were treated as outpatients in hospital facilities reimbursed through the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). These measures do not include Medicare managed care beneficiaries, non-Medicare patients, or beneficiaries who were admitted to the hospital as inpatients. </p>
<p>Beneficiaries included in the measure's initial patient population had documentation of MRI of the lumbar spine studies with a diagnosis of low back pain on the imaging claim performed at the hospital outpatient department within a one-year window of claims data. Beneficiaries can be included in the measure's initial patient population multiple times; each MRI lumbar spine study with a diagnosis of low back pain on the imaging claim performed at a facility measured by OPPS is counted once in the measure's denominator. </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: If a beneficiary had more than one MRI lumbar spine study on the same day only one study would be counted. However, if a beneficiary had multiple studies during the measurement period, each study would be counted (i.e., the beneficiary can be included in the denominator count more than once).</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Beneficiaries who have a clinical diagnosis of one or more conditions for which imaging is considered appropriate (called "red flag conditions") are excluded from the measure. These include: beneficiaries with lumbar spine surgery in the 90 days prior to the MRI, cancer, congenital spine and spinal cord malformations, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, infectious conditions, spinal vascular malformations and/or the cause of occult subarachnoid hemorrhage, spinal cord infarction, neoplastic abnormalities, treatment fields for radiation therapy, spinal abnormalities associated with scoliosis, syringohydromyelia, postoperative fluid collections and soft tissue changes, trauma, intravenous (IV) drug abuse, neurologic impairment, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), unspecified immune deficiencies, and intraspinal abscess. Thus, any beneficiary with a history of one or more of these conditions is excluded from the measure. </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Refer to the original measure documentation for additional information on the measure's initial patient population, excluded conditions, such as look-back periods, and for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code categories and corresponding organizational ID (OID) codes for the value set in the Value Set Authority Center (VSAC).</p></div>
