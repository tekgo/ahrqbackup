<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess adult dental plan patients' perceptions of their regular dentist. Patients rate their dentists on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst regular dentist possible and 10 is the best regular dentist possible. </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Typically, the percentage of ratings for the group 9 and 10 is used for consumer-level reporting; higher percentages indicate better quality. Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all groups of ratings (i.e., 9 and 10, 7 and 8, 6 or lower) are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patient satisfaction is a common subject in the dental literature, and this partly seems to result from the unique nature of dental care.  Patients tend to suffer from a fair amount of anxiety related to dental care - most notably with respect to the pain and discomfort associated (at least subjectively) with many dental procedures. One survey in Kentucky found that 40% of the population reported dental fear, with 17% reporting high dental fear.  In that same study, 52% of the population were of the opinion that "pain" was the main reason that people were afraid of the dentist.</p>

<p>The literature also shows that the level of distress, anxiety, or fear appear to influence patients' evaluations of dentists' behaviors and patients' satisfaction with care.  Level of anxiety has even been shown to influence the kind of communication style preferred by the patient.</p>

<p>Pain itself is an important dimension of the dental patient experience, and it has been shown to influence care-seeking and compliance with treatment, increase feelings of helplessness, and predict patterns of health service utilization; patients' descriptions of pain can influence clinical judgments and treatment decisions (e.g., how much pain relief is offered to the patient).  Patients view pain as a "discrete assessable component" of dental treatment.</p>

<p>Communication has been shown to be a significant influence on patient satisfaction.  Several studies emphasize the importance of dentist-patient interaction during the dental encounter - especially in terms of what has been labeled "communicative involvement" in one study.  Communicatively involved dentists appear attentive, perceptive, and responsive to patients' comments and needs; they establish rapport, discuss treatment plans and options, and help elaborate and confirm the patient's understanding of their treatment encounter.   This kind of open, interactive communication has been shown to improve the patient's overall satisfaction with their dental provider.</p>

<p>In addition, it has been generally shown that a dentist's "chairside manner" significantly influences dental care outcomes such as patients' satisfaction, anxiety, and willingness to return for further treatment.  Patients who receive incomplete, general, or impersonal information regarding their condition of treatment tend to perceive their dentist as hostile.  This desire for information reflects the desire patients have to play a collaborative role in decision-making regarding their dental care, although many perceive that they play a passive role in treatment decisions.  In some cases, however, some patients (e.g., those who suffer from particularly high anxiety) do show a preference for interaction marked by "communicative dominance" on the practitioner's part, which refers to the extent to which the dentist controls the nature and topics of the encounter.</p>

<p>Another dimension is satisfaction with the results of dental treatment.  This dimension is to some extent concentrated in the specialty area of prosthodontics - the sub-field that deals with the restoration and replacement of teeth (e.g., fitting of dentures, implants, and bridges) - although these satisfaction concerns do span other areas of dentistry.  This dimension includes basic (improvement in) comfort experienced by the patient as a result of dental work, the functionality of prosthodontic dental work (e.g., in eating or chewing, or phonetics), as well as the overall appearance, or aesthetics, of prosthodontics.</p>

Description of Allowance for Patient Factors

<div class="content_para"><p>To fairly compare your dental plan's results to those of other dental plans, we adjusted the results for differences in respondent characteristics across dental plans. These are characteristics that could change the way a patient responds to the survey regardless of their care experience; in this case: patients' age, education, and self-reported health. For example, individuals in better health and older individuals have tended to rate their care and the setting in which they receive their care higher than individuals who are younger and in poorer health. The adjusted results are those we would expect for each dental plan, if they had similar patients. For this report, the results were case-mix adjusted by respondents' age, education, and overall health status following standard CAHPS methods that have been subject to rigorous development and testing.</p></div>
