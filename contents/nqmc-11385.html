Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of all adult (greater than or equal to 18 years old) patient-months in the sample for analysis who were on end stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment for 91 days or more and dialyzed greater than 2 and less than 4 times weekly whose delivered dose of hemodialysis (calculated from the last measurements of the month using the Urea Kinetic Modeling [UKM] or Daugirdas II formula) was a single pool (sp)Kt/V greater than or equal to 1.2 during the study period.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The dose of dialysis is used to estimate the ability of hemodialysis to clear the blood of accumulated toxins. In the adult population, outcome studies have shown an association between dose of hemodialysis in terms of small solute removal and clinical outcomes (Lowrie et al., 1981; Owen et al., 1993). In addition, at least one prior study demonstrates that a change in dialysis dose is associated with a change in patient outcome (Wolfe et al., 2005). Furthermore, studies demonstrate an association between dialysis adequacy as measured by Kt/V and outcomes (Wolfe et al., 2000; Port et al., 2002; Port et al., 2004). Also, although higher dialysis dose is associated with improvement in clinical outcomes, analysis of CROWNWeb data from January 2010 indicates that only 66% of facilities had 70% or more of their patients receiving a dialysis dose of spKt/V of 1.2.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing </strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb and Medicare Claims data to calculate the inter-unit reliability (IUR) for the overall 12 months to assess the reliability of this measure. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based IUR was estimated using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. The developer notes that the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. Since this measure is not normally distributed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>For reliability the developer calculated the monthly and annual IUR across the 12 reporting months. As explained above, the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. The IUR is 0.942, which is high and suggests 94% of variation in the measure is attributed to between facility variation and approximately 6% attributed to within facility variation. The 95% confidence interval is (0.940, 0.944). </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The IUR suggests this measure is reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Validity was assessed using Spearman correlations to measure the association between facility level performance scores and the 2013 standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (NQF 0369) and standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR) (NQF 1463). </p>
<p>This measure is also established on the basis of face validity. The measure has been reviewed and approved by clinical technical expert panels (TEPs). The individual measures are also NQF endorsed. Achieving target Kt/V is included in the End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP) beginning with program year (PY) 2015, and has been reported on Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) since January 2013.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>The Spearman correlation between the HD Kt/V measure and SMR is -0.085, and statistically significant (p less than 0.0001). </p>
<p>The Spearman correlation between HD Kt/V measure and SHR is -0.160, statistically significant (p less than 0.0001). </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The Spearman correlation coefficients indicate higher facility level percentages of patients that achieve the Kt/V target is associated lower standardized mortality and hospitalization, respectively, although the magnitude of the association is low. </p></div>
