<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Antipsychotic medications offer the potential for effective treatment of psychiatric disorders in children; however, they can also increase a child's risk for developing serious health concerns, including metabolic health complications. Antipsychotic medications are associated with a number of potentially adverse impacts including weight gain (Correll, 2008) and diabetes (Andrade et al., 2011; Bobo et al., 2013).</p>
<p>A multi-year study of youth enrolled in three health maintenance organizations (HMOs) found that exposure to atypical antipsychotics was associated with a fourfold risk of diabetes in the following year, compared with children not prescribed a psychotropic medication, the broader class of medications under which antipsychotics fall (Andrade et al., 2011). Another study of youth enrolled in a state Medicaid plan found that those starting an antipsychotic had three times the risk of developing diabetes, compared with youth starting other psychotropic medications (Bobo et al., 2013). The association of atypical antipsychotics with diabetes has been found to be greater among children and adolescents than among adults (Hammerman et al., 2008).</p>
<p>Research suggests that metabolic problems in childhood and adolescence are associated with poor cardiometabolic outcomes in adulthood (Srinivasan, Myers, &amp; Berenson, 2002). The long-term consequences of pediatric obesity and other metabolic disturbances include higher risk of heart disease in adulthood (Baker, Olesen, &amp; Sorensen, 2007). Due to the potential negative health consequences associated with children developing cardiometabolic side effects from an antipsychotic medication, it is important to both establish a baseline and continuously monitor metabolic indices to ensure appropriate management of side-effects.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) (2011) guidelines recommend metabolic monitoring, including monitoring of glucose and cholesterol levels, for children and adolescents on antipsychotic medications. </p></div>
