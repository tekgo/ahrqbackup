<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 4 through 18 years treated with psychostimulant medication for the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for the first time whose medical record contains documentation of a follow-up visit within 30 days of medication initiation that includes height, weight, a discussion of medication, a discussion of school progress and a care plan.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve the primary care use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications with indications for management of patients with ADHD.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendation is fully endorsed by the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) ADHD work group:</p>
<p>"For preschool-aged children (4 to 5 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe evidence-based parent and/or teacher-administered behavior therapy as the first line of treatment, and may prescribe methylphenidate if the behavior interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continuing disturbance in the child's function. In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication at an early age against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment."</p>
<p>"For elementary school-aged children (6 to 11 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe FDA approved medications for ADHD and/or evidence based parent and/or teacher administered behavior therapy as treatment for ADHD, preferably both. The evidence is particularly strong for stimulant medications and sufficient but less strong for atomoxetine, extended-release guanfacine, and extended release Clonidine (in that order). The school environment, program, or placement is a part of any treatment plan."</p>
<p>"For adolescents (12 to 18 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe FDA-approved medications for ADHD with the assent of the adolescent and may prescribe behavior therapy as treatment for ADHD, preferably both."</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) has long had a policy of transparency in declaring potential conflicting and competing interests of all individuals who participate in the development, revision and approval of ICSI guidelines and protocols. </p>
<p>In 2010, the ICSI Conflict of Interest Review Committee was established by the Board of Directors to review all disclosures and make recommendations to the board when steps should be taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, including recommendations regarding removal of work group members. This committee has adopted the Institute of Medicine Conflict of Interest standards as outlined in the report Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2011). </p>
<p>Where there are work group members with identified potential conflicts, these are disclosed and discussed at the initial work group meeting.
