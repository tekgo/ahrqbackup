Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breaking the News</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>How should a physician tell patients that they have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>There have been no controlled trials of breaking the news in ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute any specific method of disclosing the diagnosis in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Multidisciplinary Clinic</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Does multidisciplinary management improve outcomes?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Two Class II studies and 1 Class III study show that multidisciplinary clinics specializing in ALS care are probably effective in several ways: increased use of adaptive equipment; increased utilization of riluzole, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and noninvasive ventilation (NIV); improved quality of life; and lengthened survival. However, 1 Class II study with low use of treatments found no survival benefit.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Specialized multidisciplinary clinic referral should be considered for patients with ALS to optimize health care delivery (<strong>Level B</strong>) and prolong survival (<strong>Level B</strong>), and may be considered to enhance quality of life (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Symptomatic Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the most effective treatments for sialorrhea?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>In patients with medically refractory sialorrhea, botulinum toxin B (BTxB) injections into the parotid and submandibular glands are probably effective (<strong>1 Class I study</strong>). There are inadequate data on the effectiveness of botulinum toxin A (BTxA) and amitriptyline (<strong>1 Class III study</strong>). Low-dose irradiation is possibly effective for sialorrhea (<strong>2 Class III studies</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>In patients with ALS who have medically refractory sialorrhea, BTxB should be considered (<strong>Level B</strong>) and low-dose radiation therapy to the salivary glands may be considered (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What pharmacologic measures reduce pseudobulbar affect?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>The combination of dextromethorphan/quinidine (DM/Q) is probably effective for pseudobulbar affect in ALS (<strong>1 Class I study</strong>), although side effects may limit its usefulness.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>If approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and if side effects are acceptable, DM/Q should be considered for symptoms of pseudobulbar affect in patients with ALS (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What pharmacologic interventions reduce fatigue?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>There are no controlled studies of pharmacologic agents relieving fatigue in ALS. Riluzole possibly causes fatigue in some patients (<strong>2 Class III studies</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>In patients developing fatigue while taking riluzole, once risks of fatigue versus modest survival benefits have been discussed, withholding the drug may be considered (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What interventions reduce cramps?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Studies of gabapentin, vitamin E, and riluzole for treating cramps were all negative (<strong>Class III</strong>). There are safety concerns about quinine.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute any specific intervention for the treatment of cramps in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What interventions reduce spasticity?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Evidence is insufficient to recommend exercise or medication for treating spasticity in ALS (<strong>Class III</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute exercise or medication for treating spasticity in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What pharmacologic interventions reduce depression?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>There have been no controlled trials of treatment for depression in ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute specific treatments for depression in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What pharmacologic interventions reduce anxiety?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>There have been no trials of treatment for anxiety in ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute specific treatment for anxiety in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What pharmacologic interventions reduce insomnia?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>There have been no studies of treatment for insomnia in ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute specific treatment for insomnia in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cognitive and Behavioral Impairment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the prevalence and natural history of cognitive and behavioral impairment in ALS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>A significant proportion of patients with ALS demonstrate cognitive impairment and some have dementia (<strong>2 Class II, multiple Class III studies</strong>). Neither behavioral impairment in ALS nor the natural progression of cognitive or behavioral impairments has been adequately studied.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Screening for cognitive and behavioral impairment should be considered in patients with ALS (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>How is cognitive or behavioral impairment in ALS diagnosed?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Neuropsychological assessment is possibly effective for identifying cognitive impairment in ALS (<strong>1 Class II, 1 Class III</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Screening tests of executive function may be considered to detect cognitive impairment in patients with ALS prior to confirmation with formal neuropsychological evaluation (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What is the effect of cognitive or behavioral impairment on management of patients with ALS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Insufficient data exist on the effect of cognitive or behavioral impairment on the management of patients with ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute the impact of cognitive and behavioral impairment on management in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>). </p>
<p><strong>What treatments are effective for cognitive or behavioral impairment in ALS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Data are inadequate regarding the effect of pharmacologic treatment or NIV for cognitive or behavioral impairment in ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute treatment of cognitive or behavioral impairment in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communication</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What treatments for dysarthria optimize communication in ALS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>No controlled studies examined communication in ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute treatment to optimize communication in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Palliative Care</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What treatments reduce pain and dyspnea in the terminal phase of ALS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>No controlled studies examined treating pain or dyspnea in late-stage ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute specific treatments for pain and dyspnea in late-stage ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Do hospice care, spiritual interventions, or advance directives improve quality of life in the terminal phase of ALS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>No controlled studies examined hospice, spiritual care, or advance directives in ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute hospice, spiritual care, or advance directives in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>What is the optimal method of withdrawing both noninvasive and invasive ventilation in ALS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>There are no controlled studies examining withdrawal of ventilation in ALS.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support or refute specific strategies for withdrawal of ventilation in ALS (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Studies of Therapeutic Intervention</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences. The following are also required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for drop-outs (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and cross-overs with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias </li>
    <li>For non-inferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or non-inferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the results of the study is based upon a per protocol analysis that takes into account dropouts or crossovers. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A randomized controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a&ndash;e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b&ndash;e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.**</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria including consensus or expert opinion.</p>
<p class="Note">*Note that numbers 1-3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class="Note">**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Diagnostic Accuracy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study where a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data was collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = A case control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of a diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if: 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p></div>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) assembled a panel of experts with expertise in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology developed a set of clinical questions relevant to the evaluation of multidisciplinary care, symptom management, and cognitive/behavioral impairment issues related to the care of patients with ALS. The strength of the practice recommendations was directly linked to the class of evidence using the scheme described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The AAN assesses their clinical practice guidelines every 2 years to determine whether new literature has been published that would warrant an update. The following steps are taken:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Biennial correspondence is sent to all authors and the facilitator. </li>
    <li>An updated literature search and a review of methodological soundness are performed by a Guideline Development Subcommittee (GDS) member. (Note: The search should specifically seek to identify new evidence that would change the conclusions in the systematic review or recommendations in the CPG.) </li>
</ul>
<p>All documents biennially reviewed by the GDS that don't require an update are reaffirmed. See the AAN <a href="http://tools.aan.com/globals/axon/assets/9023.pdf" title="AAN Web site">Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual</a> for additional information.</p></div>

Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.*)</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if: 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p></div>

<p><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology is committed to producing independent, critical and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least three AAN committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology&reg; peer reviewers and representatives from related fields. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.aan.com" title="AAN Web site">www.aan.com</a>.</p></div>
