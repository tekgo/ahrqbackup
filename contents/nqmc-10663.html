<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of surgical patients, aged 18 years and older, who receive an anesthetic when undergoing procedures with the indications for prophylactic parenteral antibiotics for whom administration of a prophylactic parenteral antibiotic ordered has been initiated within one hour (if fluoroquinolone or vancomycin, two hours) prior to the surgical incision (or start of procedure when no incision is required).</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The appropriate timing of administration of prophylactic parenteral antibiotics has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of surgical wound infections. Available evidence suggests that although most surgical patients receive a prophylactic antibiotic, many do not receive the drug within one hour before incision as recommended. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>:</p>
<p>Overall, administration of the first dose of antimicrobial beginning within 60 minutes before surgical incision is recommended. Administration of vancomycin and fluoroquinolones should begin within 120 minutes before surgical incision because of the prolonged infusion times required for these drugs (Bratzler et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Infusion of the first antimicrobial dose should begin within 60 minutes before incision. However, when a fluoroquinolone or vancomycin is indicated, the infusion should begin within 120 minutes before incision to prevent antibiotic-associated reactions. Although research has demonstrated that administration of the antimicrobial at the time of anesthesia induction is safe and results in adequate serum and tissue drug levels at the time of incision, there was no consensus that the infusion must be completed before incision (Bratzler et al., 2004).</p></div>
