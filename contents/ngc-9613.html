<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of recommendation (1-3) and classes of&nbsp;evidence (I-III) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A single preoperative dose of prophylactic antibiotics with broad-spectrum aerobic and anaerobic coverage should be administered to all patients sustaining penetrating abdominal wounds. </li>
    <li>Prophylactic antibiotics should be continued for not more than 24 hours in the presence of a hollow viscus injury in the acutely injured patient. </li>
    <li>Absence of a hollow viscus injury requires no further administration of antibiotics. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>There are no Level 2 recommendations. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In patients admitted with hemorrhagic shock, the administered dose of antibiotics may be increased twofold or threefold and repeated after transfusion of every 10 units of blood until there is no further blood loss. </li>
    <li>Aminoglycosides should be avoided because of suboptimal activity in patients with significant injuries if possible. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classes of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective, randomized, double-blind study</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Prospective, randomized, non-blinded trial</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Retrospective series of patients or meta-analysis</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: The recommendation is convincingly justifiable based on the available scientific information alone. This recommendation is usually based on Class I data, however, strong Class II evidence may form the basis for a level 1 recommendation, especially if the issue does not lend itself to testing in a randomized format. Conversely, low quality or contradictory Class I data may not be able to support a level 1 recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Level II</strong>: The recommendation is reasonably justifiable by available scientific evidence and strongly supported by expert opinion. This recommendation is usually supported by Class II data or a preponderance of Class III evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: The recommendation is supported by available data but adequate scientific evidence is lacking. This recommendation is generally supported by Class III data. This type of recommendation is useful for educational purposes and in guiding future clinical research.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>To develop updated recommendations from the 1998 original guideline document on the use of prophylactic antibiotics in penetrating abdominal trauma </li>
    <li>To address the clinical questions:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

        <li>What is the appropriate duration of postoperative antibiotics in penetrating abdominal trauma? </li>
        <li>Should perioperative antibiotic use be altered in the absence of hollow viscus injury at the time of laparotomy? </li>
        <li>Is it necessary to redose antibiotics in the setting of hemorrhage? </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2012 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A MEDLINE search was performed to identify publications from 1973 to 2011 using the key words "antibiotic prophylaxis," "penetrating abdominal injuries," "abdominal injuries," "complications," "peritonitis," "wound infection prevention and control," "open abdomen," "damage control laparotomy" (DCL), "pharmacokinetics," and "trauma." In addition, references included among the initial 1998 Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guidelines were included.</p>
<p>Forty-four English language articles were included in the analysis; letters to the editor, case reports, and review articles were omitted. The bibliography of each article was also reviewed to identify additional publications that may not have been identified in the original MEDLINE query.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline developer searched PubMed, Pubmed Central, Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science using the following search terms: "antibiotic prophylaxis," "penetrating abdominal injuries," "abdominal injuries," "complications," "peritonitis," "wound infection prevention and control," "open abdomen," "damage control laparotomy (DCL)," "pharmacokinetics," and "trauma." The literature search was performed for Nov 2012-October 2017. All articles with damage control laparotomy and infection rates were included, while non-English language, and editorials and opinion papers were excluded. </p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
