<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the median time from admit decision time to time of departure from the emergency department (ED) for admitted patients.</p>
<p>This measure represents the overall rate. The following rates are also reported:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Reporting measure </li>
    <li>Psychiatric/mental health patients </li>
</ul></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Reducing the time patients remain in the emergency department (ED) can improve access to treatment and increase quality of care. Reducing this time potentially improves access to care specific to the patient condition and increases the capability to provide additional treatment. In recent times, EDs have experienced significant overcrowding. Although once only a problem in large, urban, teaching hospitals, the phenomenon has spread to other suburban and rural healthcare organizations. According to a 2002 national United States (U.S.) survey, more than 90% of large hospitals report EDs operating "at" or "over" capacity. Approximately one third of hospitals in the U.S. report increases in ambulance diversion in a given year, whereas up to half report crowded conditions in the ED. In a recent national survey, 40% of hospital leaders viewed ED crowding as a symptom of workforce shortages. ED crowding may result in delays in the administration of medication such as antibiotics for pneumonia and has been associated with perceptions of compromised emergency care. For patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, long ED stays were associated with decreased use of guideline-recommended therapies and a higher risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Overcrowding and heavy emergency resource demand have led to a number of problems, including ambulance refusals, prolonged patient waiting times, increased suffering for those who wait, rushed and unpleasant treatment environments, and potentially poor patient outcomes. When EDs are overwhelmed, their ability to respond to community emergencies and disasters may be compromised.</p></div>
