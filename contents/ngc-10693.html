<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Types of Participants, Interventions, and Comparators</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers included studies of adults (18 years of age and older) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using symptom-based diagnostic criteria. The interventions were linaclotide, lubiprostone, polyethylene glycol (PEG) laxative, rifaximin, alosetron, loperamide, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, should be noted that there is a lack of comparative effectiveness studies in IBS.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Sources and Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>An information specialist, with input from the authors, developed and conducted several literature searches. The following bibliographic databases were searched through the OVID interface: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, and EMBASE. Parallel searches included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Methodology Register, and Health Technology Assessment Database. The search strategy comprised controlled vocabulary, including the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings and keywords. The main search concepts included and combined were "irritable bowel syndrome" and "linaclotide" and "lubiprostone" and "polyethylene glycol" and "rifaximin" and "alosetron" and "tricyclic antidepressants" and "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors" and "antispasmodics." Methodological filters were applied to limit retrieval to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and health technology assessments. The results were limited to English, human, and 1995 onward (see the "Supplementary Methods" section in the technical review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field] for detailed search strategies). An additional search was conducted using the aforementioned Medical Subject Headings and keywords and was limited to meta-analysis and technology assessments from 2004 onward.</p>
<p>In selecting studies, the reviewers followed the umbrella systematic review approach in which the committee identified published systematic reviews that fit predetermined eligibility criteria and were of high methodological rigor. A systematic review was eligible for inclusion if it was recently conducted (search strategy executed within the past 10 years), evaluated the outcomes of interest (outcomes important to patients) outlined in the technical review, and provided a quantitative estimate of effect. The reviewers supplemented this by reviewing additional RCTs not included in the systematic reviews as well as references of relevant articles from the systematic reviews.</p>
<p>The parameters for the first search was between 1/1994-3/2014 and then an additional search was conducted with the parameters of 1/2004-5/2014.</p>
<p>For more information on excluded and included studies and search strategies, refer to the technical review.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>When systematic reviews were not up to date or were incomplete, the reviewers performed their own meta-analysis (random effects model for 3 or more studies and fixed effects model for 2 studies) using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.1 software.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluating the Evidence: Risk of Bias and Study Quality Appraisal</span></strong></p>
<p>Within the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) start as high-quality evidence but can be rated down for 5 possible reasons. Using GRADE, the quality of evidence for each outcome was evaluated for the following domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. When the systematic reviews did not provide sufficient information to judge the quality of the evidence, individual studies were retrieved. Evidence ratings and qualitative judgments were determined via telephone discussion and consensus. For each question, an overall judgment of quality of evidence was made for a body of evidence that encompassed all critical outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synthesis of Results and Summary Measures</span></strong></p>
<p>When available, quantitative estimates of effect were applied from existing systematic reviews. Additional data were extracted and synthesized for some outcomes using RevMan. If results were incomplete or unclear, study authors or study sponsors were contacted for additional information. Evidence profiles (see Tables 2&ndash;10 in the technical review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) were used to display the summary estimates as well as the body of evidence for each clinical question.</p>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The guideline was developed by the Clinical Practice and Quality Measures Committee (currently the Clinical Practice Guideline Committee) and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Governing Board.</p>
<p>The guideline was developed using a process outlined in the technical review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Briefly, the AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines incorporates Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and best practices as outlined by the Institute of Medicine. GRADE methodology was used to prepare the background information for the guideline and the technical review that accompanies it (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). Optimal understanding of this guideline will be enhanced by reading applicable portions of the technical review.</p>
<p>Members of the guideline panel, along with AGA support staff and a patient/consumer representative, met in person with the authors of the technical review on April 11, 2014. The information in the technical review was discussed in a systematic manner, facilitating subsequent creation of the guideline recommendations for or against each intervention. The strength of each recommendation was also rated as either strong or conditional.</p>
<p>Using the PICO format, which frames a clinical question by defining a specific patient population (P), intervention (I), comparator (C), and outcome(s), the guideline developers outlined a total of 9 questions (see Table 1 in the technical review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p></div>

    <li>Diarrhea leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in a small percentage of patients treated with linaclotide. </li>
    <li>Alosetron is only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for use in women, and because of concerns about idiopathic, non-dose-dependent ischemic colitis (approximately 1 case/1000 patient-years), the drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market and subsequently reintroduced only under a specific physician-based risk management program. </li>
    <li>Tricyclic antidepressants should be used with caution in patients at risk for prolongation of the QT interval. </li>
