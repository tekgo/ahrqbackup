Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy who had a dilated macular or fundus exam performed which included documentation of the level of severity of retinopathy AND the presence or absence of macular edema during one or more office visits within 12 months.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of new cases of legal blindness among working-age Americans and represents a leading cause of blindness in this age group worldwide (Klein, 2007).</p>
<p>Ensuring timely treatment that could prevent blindness due to diabetes requires the performance and documentation of key examination parameters. The documented level of severity of retinopathy and the documented presence or absence of macular edema assists with the on-going plan of care for the patient with diabetic retinopathy.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statement is quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represents the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>Because treatment is effective in reducing the risk of visual loss, detailed examination is indicated to assess for the following features that often lead to visual impairment: presence of macular edema, optic nerve neovascularization and/or neovascularization elsewhere, signs of severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (extensive retinal hemorrhages/microaneurysms, venous beading, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities [IRMA]), and vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage (American Academy of Ophthalmology Retina/Vitreous Panel, 2014).</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Rates of eye examinations for elderly persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) or frequently occurring eye diseases, especially for DM, remain far below recommended levels in a nationally representative sample of persons with health insurance coverage (Sloan, Yashkin, &amp; Chen, 2014). Several factors, including limited physical and cognitive function and greater distance to an ophthalmologist, but not health insurance coverage, account for variation in regular use. Although effective treatment is available, fewer patients with diabetes are referred by their primary care physicians for ophthalmic care than would be expected according to guidelines by the American Diabetes Association and the American Academy of Ophthalmology (Kraft et al., 1997). In two community-based studies, 43% to 65% of participants had not received a dilated eye examination at the time of enrollment (Paz et al., 2006).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on several measure testing projects in 2012, 2013 and 2015 to ensure the Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Optic Nerve Evaluation, Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Documentation of Presence or Absence of Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Communication with the Physician Managing Ongoing Diabetes Care measures are reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator and exception case identification. The testing projects were conducted utilizing electronic health record data and registry data. Parallel forms reliability and signal-to-noise reliability was tested.</p>
<p>One site participated in the parallel forms testing of the Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Documentation of Presence or Absence of Macular Edema measure. Site A was a physician-owned private practice with one ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>Signal-to-noise reliability was assessed using 2013 data acquired from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Physician Quality Reporting System Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) database.</p>
<p><strong>Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Documentation of Presence or Absence of Macular Edema </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parallel Forms Reliability Testing (Site A)</span> </p>
<p>There were 155 observations from one site used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide by zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used. </p>
<p>Of the 155 observations that were initially selected, 155 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.76 demonstrates substantial agreement between the automated report and reviewer.</p>
<p>Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval) <br />
Denominator: 155, 100.0%, Non-Calculable* (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)** <br />
Numerator: 155, 96.1%, 0.76 (0.58, 0.95) <br />
Exception: 155, 100.0%, Non-Calculable* (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)** </p>
<p class="Note">*Cannot calculate kappa statistics when only one response (Yes/Yes) was used, as this causes a divide-by-zero error in the statistic formula.</p>
<p class="Note">**This is an example of the limitation of the Kappa statistic. While the agreement can be 90% or greater, if one classification category dominates, the Kappa can be significantly reduced.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signal-to-Noise Reliability Testing</span></p>
<p>For this measure, the reliability at the minimum level of quality reporting events (10) was 0.86. The average number of quality reporting events for physicians included is 76.8. The reliability at the average number of quality reporting events was 0.98. </p>
<p>This measure has high reliability when evaluated at the minimum level of quality reporting events and high reliability at the average number of quality events.</p></div>
