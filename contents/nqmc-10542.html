Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 18 years of age and older who received at least 180 treatment days of ambulatory medication therapy for a select therapeutic agent during the measurement year and at least one therapeutic monitoring event for the therapeutic agent in the measurement year. For each product line, report each of the three rates separately and as a total rate.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Annual monitoring for members on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) </li>
    <li>Annual monitoring for members on digoxin </li>
    <li>Annual monitoring for members on diuretics </li>
    <li>Total rate (the sum of the three numerators divided by the sum of the three denominators) </li>
</ul>
<p>This measure summary&nbsp;represents the total rate.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patient safety is highly important, especially for patients at increased risk of adverse drug events from long-term medication use. Persistent use of these drugs warrants monitoring and follow-up by the prescribing physician to assess for side-effects and adjust drug dosage/therapeutic decisions accordingly. The drugs included in this measure have deleterious effects in the elderly.</p>
<p>The costs of annual monitoring are offset by the reduction in health care costs associated with complications arising from lack of monitoring and follow-up of patients on long-term medications. The total costs of drug-related problems due to misuse of drugs in the ambulatory setting has been estimated to exceed $76 billion annually (Johnson &amp; Bootman, 1995).</p>
<p>Appropriate monitoring of drug therapy remains a significant issue to guide therapeutic decision making and provides largely unmet opportunities for improvement in care for patients on persistent medications (Classen, 2003). Although there are no specific clinical guideline recommendations on the frequency of monitoring for the drugs identified in the measure, annual monitoring represents a conservative standard of care and is supported by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labeling recommendations for each drug. </p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Adverse drug events cause more than 700,000 visits to the emergency room (ER) each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). The more medications people take, the higher their risk of having an adverse drug event (CDC, 2012). </li>
    <li>Approximately 1.5 million preventable adverse drug events occur in the United States each year, resulting in $3.5 billion in medical costs (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2007). </li>
    <li>About 82 percent of adults in the United States take at least one medication (prescription or nonprescription drug, vitamin/mineral, herbal/natural supplement); 29 percent take five or more (Slone Epidemiology Center, n.d.). </li>
    <li>Severe adverse drug events can result in hospitalization. From 2007 to 2009, there were an estimated 99,628 emergency hospitalizations for adverse drug events in adults 65 years of age or older (Budnitz et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>Adverse drug events contribute to patient injury and increased health care costs. For patients on persistent medications, appropriate monitoring can reduce the occurrence of preventable adverse drug events. </li>
