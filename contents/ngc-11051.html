<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for levels of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, <strong>very low</strong>) and strength of recommendation (<strong>strong</strong>, <strong>weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Considerations Before Stent Placement</span></strong></p>
<p>Prophylactic colonic stent placement is not recommended. Colonic stenting should be reserved for patients with clinical symptoms and imaging evidence of malignant large-bowel obstruction, without signs of perforation (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan is recommended as the primary diagnostic tool when malignant colonic obstruction is suspected (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>Examination of the remaining colon with colonoscopy or CT colonography (CTC) is recommended in patients with potentially curable obstructing colonic cancer, preferably within 3 months after alleviation of the obstruction (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>Colonic stenting should be avoided for diverticular strictures or when diverticular disease is suspected during endoscopy and/or CT scan (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>). Pathological confirmation of malignancy by endoscopic biopsy and/or brush cytology is not necessary in an urgent setting, such as before stent placement. However, pathology results may help to modify further management of the stented patient (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>Preparation of obstructed patients with an enema to clean the colon distal to the stenosis is suggested to facilitate the stent placement procedure (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>). Antibiotic prophylaxis in obstructed patients undergoing colon stenting is not indicated because the risk of post-procedural infections is very low (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>Colonic stent placement should be performed or directly supervised by an experienced operator who has performed at least 20 colonic stent placement procedures (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Considerations of Stent Placement</span></strong></p>
<p>Colonic stent placement is recommended with the combined use of endoscopy and fluoroscopy (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>Stricture dilation either before or after stent placement is discouraged in the setting of obstructing colorectal cancer (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>Covered and uncovered self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) are equally effective and safe (<strong>high quality evidence</strong>). The stent should have a body diameter &ge;24 mm (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>) and a length suitable to extend at least 2 cm on each side of the lesion after stent deployment (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>Surgical resection is suggested as the preferred treatment for malignant obstruction of the proximal colon in patients with potentially curable disease (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>). In a palliative setting, SEMS can be an alternative to emergency surgery (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>SEMS placement is a valid alternative to surgery for the palliation of malignant extracolonic obstruction (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>). The technical and clinical success rates of stenting for extracolonic malignancies are inferior to those reported in stenting of primary colonic cancer (<strong>low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to discourage colonic stenting based on the length of the stenosis (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>) or the degree of obstruction (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Indication: SEMS Placement as a Bridge to Elective Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p>Colonic SEMS placement as a bridge to elective surgery is not recommended as a standard treatment of symptomatic left-sided malignant colonic obstruction (<strong>strong recommendation, high quality evidence</strong>). For patients with potentially curable left-sided obstructing colonic cancer, stent placement may be considered as an alternative to emergency surgery in those who have an increased risk of postoperative mortality, i.e., American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) &ge;III and/or age &gt;70 years (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>A time interval to operation of 5 to 10 days is suggested when SEMS is used as a bridge to elective surgery in patients with potentially curable left-sided colon cancer (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Indication: Palliative SEMS Placement</span></strong></p>
<p>SEMS placement is the preferred treatment for palliation of malignant colonic obstruction (<strong>strong recommendation, high quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>Patients who have undergone palliative stenting can be safely treated with chemotherapy without antiangiogenic agents (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>). Given the high risk of colonic perforation, it is not recommended to use SEMS as palliative decompression if a patient is being treated or considered for treatment with antiangiogenic therapy (e.g., bevacizumab) (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adverse Events Related to Colonic Stenting</span></strong></p>
<p>When stent obstruction or migration occurs in the palliative setting, endoscopic re-intervention by stent-in-stent placement or SEMS replacement is suggested (<strong>weak recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>). Surgery should always be considered in patients with stent-related perforation (<strong>strong recommendation, low quality evidence</strong>).</p>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>No clear conclusions may be drawn about differences in costs between self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) as bridge to surgery and emergency surgery procedures. In the two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared costs between SEMS as bridge to surgery and emergency surgery, stenting seems to be the more costly strategy. Cost-effectiveness depends on the rate of stent complications, in particular perforation, and a greater benefit of stenting is expected in high risk surgical patients.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate use of self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) for obstructing colonic and extracolonic cancer </li>
    <li>Two noncomparative studies addressed the learning curve of a single endoscopist performing colonic stent placement. Both showed an increase in technical success and a decrease in the number of stents used per procedure after performance of at least 20 procedures. Two other retrospective series have shown that operator experience affects stenting outcome. The first reported significantly higher technical and clinical success rates when the stent was inserted by an operator who had performed at least 10 SEMS procedures. The second showed a significantly increased immediate perforation rate when colonic stent placement was performed by endoscopists inexperienced in pancreaticobiliary endoscopy. The authors of the latter article explained the lower immediate perforation rate by the skills that therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) endoscopists have in traversing complex strictures, understanding fluoroscopy, and deploying stents. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Colonic self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) placement in patients with malignant large-bowel obstruction is associated with potential adverse events. However, the 30-day stent-related mortality rate is less than 4%.</p>
<p>Adverse events related to colonic stent placement are usually divided into early (&le;30 days) and late (&gt;30 days). The main early complications are perforation (range 0%&ndash;12.8%), stent failure after technically successful stent deployment (range 0%&ndash;11.7%), stent migration (range 0%&ndash;4.9%), re-obstruction (range 0%&ndash;4.9%), pain (range 0%&ndash;7.4%), and bleeding (range 0%&ndash;3.7%). Late adverse events related to SEMS mainly include re-obstruction (range 4.0%&ndash;22.9%) and stent migration (range 1.0%&ndash;12.5%), and more rarely perforation (range 0%&ndash;4.0%), although one randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported late perforations in 4 out of 10 stent patients. Other SEMS complications reported less frequently in the literature are tenesmus (up to 22%, related to rectal SEMS), incontinence, and fistula.</p>
<p>Stent-related perforation may result from different causes which can be classified as: (i) guidewire or catheter malpositioning; (ii) dilation of the stricture before or after stent placement; (iii) stent-induced perforation (tumor and nontumor local perforation); and (iv) proximal colonic distension because of inadequate colonic decompression or excessive air insufflation. The final outcome of stent perforation has been inconsistently reported in the literature, although a perforation-related mortality rate of 50% is observed in a number of prospective and retrospective studies. Furthermore, there are strong indications that perforation compromises the oncological outcome in patients with colorectal cancer. Concurrent bevacizumab therapy, intraprocedural and post-stenting stricture dilation, and diverticular strictures were identified by several studies as risk factors for stent-related perforation.</p>
<p>Stent migration can occur at any time following colonic stenting. Factors that have been identified to correlate with the occurrence of migration are use of covered SEMS and of small-diameter (&lt;24 mm) stents, and there is some evidence that chemotherapy may also be associated with stent migration by the mechanism of tumor shrinkage.</p>
<p>Tumor ingrowth/overgrowth is the main cause of stent re-obstruction and usually occurs during the long-term course of stent therapy. The use of uncovered SEMS is a risk factor for tumor ingrowth. One retrospective series focusing on predictive factors of stent occlusion found that &lt;70% stent expansion within the first 48 hours is also predictive for the occurrence of re-obstruction.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines represent a consensus of best practice based on the available evidence at the time of preparation. They may not apply in all situations and should be interpreted in the light of specific clinical situations and resource availability. Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of these statements, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of action at variance to these recommendations. ESGE guidelines are intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. They are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment.</p></div>
