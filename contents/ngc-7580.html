<p><strong>Note from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)</strong>: This summary does not contain rationales that explain how and why these recommendations were developed nor does it contain the evidence supporting these recommendations. All readers of this summary are strongly urged to consult the full guideline and evidence report (see "Guideline Availability" field) for this information. The work group is confident that those who read the full guideline and evidence report will also see that the recommendations were developed using systematic evidence-based processes designed to combat bias, enhance transparency, and promote reproducibility. This summary of recommendations is not intended to stand alone.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Study Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The study group developed <em>a priori</em> article inclusion criteria for review. These criteria are the "rules of evidence" and articles that do not meet them are, for the purposes of this guideline, not evidence.</p>
<p>To be included in the systematic reviews (and hence, in this guideline) an article had to be a report of a study that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evaluated a treatment for acute Achilles tendon rupture. Acute Achilles tendon ruptures are defined as a rupture treated within zero to six weeks post injury. </li>
    <li>Was a full report of a clinical study and was published in the peer reviewed literature </li>
    <li>Was an English language article published after 1965 </li>
    <li>Was not a cadaveric, animal, <em>in vitro</em>, or biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not a retrospective case series, medical records review, meeting abstract, unpublished study report, case report, historical article, editorial, letter, or commentary </li>
    <li>Was the most recent report of a study or the report with the largest number of enrolled patients in a study with multiple publications </li>
    <li>Enrolled &ge;10 patients in each of its study groups </li>
    <li>Enrolled a patient population comprised of at least 80% of patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture </li>
    <li>Reported quantified results </li>
    <li>Must have followed 50% or more of its patients on at least one outcome; if less than 80% follow up the outcome was down graded. </li>
    <li>Study must use validated outcome measures </li>
</ul>
<p>When considering studies for inclusion, the work group included only the best available evidence. Accordingly, they first included Level I evidence. In the absence of two or more studies of this Level, they sequentially searched for and included Level II through Level IV evidence, and did not proceed to a lower level if there were two or more studies of a higher level. For example, if there were two Level II studies that addressed a recommendation, they did not include Level III or IV studies.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Searches</strong></p>
<p>The work group attempted to make the searches for articles comprehensive. Using comprehensive literature searches ensures that the evidence the work group considered for this guideline is not biased for (or against) any particular point of view.</p>
<p>The work group searched for articles published from January 1966 to June 2009. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by a Medical Librarian and reviewed by the work group. The search strategies are provided in Appendix IV in the original guideline document. Six electronic databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, The National Guideline Clearinghouse and TRIP database.</p>
<p>All searches of electronic databases were supplemented with manual screening of bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The work group also searched the bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. Finally, a list of potentially relevant studies not identified by the searches was provided by the work group members. Fifty-six studies met the inclusion criteria and were included.</p>
<p>A study attrition diagram (provided in Appendix V in the original guideline document) documents, for each recommendation, the number of articles identified, where they were identified, the number of articles included, and the number of articles excluded.</p>
<p><strong>2014 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>The 2009 guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on the treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture in adults, where adults were defined as older than 19 years of age.</p>
<p>To reaffirm currency the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched using the following search terms: (("Achilles Tendon"[mh] OR achilles[tw]) AND ((("Tendon Injuries"[mh] OR injuries[sh] OR injur*[tiab] OR ruptur*[tiab] OR re-ruptur*[tiab] OR tears[tiab] OR torn[tiab] OR tear[tiab]) AND (diagnosis[sh] OR diagnos*[tw] OR "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"[mh] OR MRI[tiab] OR Ultrasonography[mh] OR sonograph*[tiab] OR ultrasound[tiab] OR radiograph*[tiab] OR Radiography[mh] OR x-ray[tiab] OR imaging[tiab] OR gap[tiab] OR "Thompson test"[tw] OR therapy[sh] OR treated[tiab] OR treatment*[tiab] OR brace[tiab] OR bracing[tiab] OR cast[tiab] OR casting[tiab] OR casts[tw] OR "Casts, Surgical"[mh] OR immobiliz*[tiab] OR surgery[tiab] OR surgical*[tiab] OR operati*[tiab] OR repair*[tiab] OR reconstruct*[tiab] OR non-operativ*[tiab] OR nonoperativ*[tiab] OR "weight bearing"[tiab] OR "Recovery of Function"[mh] OR "Physical Therapy Modalities"[mh] OR physiotherapy[tiab] OR Anticoagulants[pa])) OR ((repair*[tiab] OR surgery[tiab] OR surgery[sh] OR surgical*[tiab] OR operati*[tiab] OR repair*[tiab] OR reconstruct*[tiab] OR post-operative*[tiab] OR postoperative*[tiab]) AND ("Physical Therapy Modalities"[mh] OR physiotherapy[tiab] OR brace[tiab] OR bracing[tiab] OR cast[tiab] OR casting[tiab] OR casts[tw] OR "Casts, Surgical"[mh] OR immobiliz*[tiab] OR low-impact[tiab] OR activity[tiab] OR activities[tiab] OR "weight bearing"[tiab] OR weight-bearing[tiab] OR "Recovery of Function"[mh])))).

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Data elements extracted from studies were defined in consultation with the physician work group. Two analysts completed data extraction independently for all studies. The evidence tables were audited by the work group. Disagreements about the accuracy of extracted data were resolved by consensus. The elements extracted are provided in Appendix VI in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The use of extracted data in the systematic reviews is another of the methods to combat bias. It ensures that the results are based on the numerical results reported in published articles and not on the authors' conclusions in the "Discussion Sections" of their articles. Such author conclusions can be influenced by bias.</p>
<p><strong>Judging the Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The work group assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome at each time point reported in a study. They did not simply assess the overall quality of a study. The approach follows the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group as well as others.</p>
<p>The work group evaluated quality on a per outcome basis rather than a per study basis because quality is not necessarily the same for all outcomes and all follow-up times reported in a study. For example, a study might report results immediately after patients received a given treatment and after some period of time has passed. Often, nearly all enrolled patients contribute data at early follow-up times but, at much later follow-up times, only a few patients may contribute data. One has more confidence in the earlier data than in the later data. The fact that the work group would assign a higher quality score to the earlier results reflects this difference in confidence.</p>
<p>The work group assessed the quality of treatment studies using a two step process. First, they assigned a Level of Evidence to all results reported in a study based solely on that study's design. Accordingly, all data presented in randomized controlled trials were initially categorized as Level I evidence, all results presented in non-randomized controlled trials and other prospective comparative studies were initially categorized as Level II, all results presented in retrospective comparative and case-control studies were initially categorized as Level III, and all results presented in case-series reports were initially categorized as Level IV. The work groups next assessed each outcome at each reported time point using a quality questionnaire and, when quality standards were not met, downgraded the Level of evidence (for this outcome at this time point) by one level (see Appendix VII in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>In studies investigating a diagnostic test, the work group used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) instrument to identify potential bias and assess variability and the quality of reporting in studies reporting the effectiveness of diagnostic techniques. The work group utilized a two step process to assess the quality of diagnostic studies. All studies enrolling a prospective cohort of patients are initially categorized as Level I studies. Any study that did not enroll the appropriate spectrum of patients (e.g., case-control studies) was initially categorized as a Level IV study. A study that was determined to contain methodological flaws (i.e., QUADAS question answered 'no') that introduce bias was downgraded in a cumulative manner for each known bias (see Appendix VII in the original guideline document). For example, a study that is determined by the QUADAS instrument to have two biases is downgraded to Level III and a study that is determined to have four or more biases is downgraded to a Level V study. Those studies that do not sufficiently report their methods for a potential bias are downgraded to Level II since the work group is unable to determine if the bias did or did not bias the results of the study.</p>
<p>Assigning a Level of Evidence on the basis of study design plus other quality characteristics ties the Levels of Evidence that are reported more closely to quality than Levels of Evidence based only on study design. Because the work group ties quality to Levels of Evidence, they are able to characterize the confidence one can have in their results. Accordingly, the work group characterizes the confidence one can have in Level I evidence as high, the confidence one can have in Level II and III evidence as moderate, and the confidence one can have in Level IV and V evidence as low.</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Methods</strong></p>
<p>When possible, the work group reported the results of the statistical analyses conducted by the authors of the included studies. In some circumstances, statistical testing was not conducted; however, the authors reported sufficient quantitative data, including measures of dispersion or patient level data for statistical testing. In these circumstances they used the statistical program STATA (StatCorp LP, College Station, Texas) to conduct their own analysis to interpret the results of a study. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Any statistical analysis conducted by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) authors is denoted in the tables.</p>
<p>STATA was also used to determine 95% confidence intervals, using the method of Wilson, when authors of the included studies reported counts or proportions. The program was also used to determine the magnitude of the treatment effect. For data reported as means (and associated measures of dispersion) the work group calculated a standardized mean difference by the method of Hedges and Olkin. For proportions, they calculated the odds ratio as a measure of treatment effect. When no events occur ("zero event") in a proportion, the variance of the arcsine difference was used to determine statistical significance (p &lt;0.05).</p>
<p>The work group used the program TechDig 2.0 (Ronald B. Jones, Mundelein, Illinois) to estimate means and variances from studies presenting data only in graphical form.</p>
<p>When published studies only reported the median, range, and size of the trial, the work group estimated their means and variances according to a published method.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline and the underlying systematic reviews were prepared by an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) physician work group with the assistance of the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit in the Department of Research and Scientific Affairs at the AAOS. The work group met on December 13, 2008 to establish the guideline's scope. The work group met again on July 31 and August 1, 2009 to write and vote on the final recommendations and rationales for each recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Formulating Preliminary Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The work group began work on this guideline by constructing a set of preliminary recommendations. These recommendations specify [what] should be done in [whom], [when], [where], and [how often or how long]. They function as questions for the systematic review that underpins each preliminary recommendation, and they do not function as final recommendations or conclusions. Preliminary recommendations do not need to be true.</p>
<p>Once established, these <em>a priori</em> preliminary recommendations cannot be modified until the final work group meeting. The <em>a priori</em> and inviolate nature of the preliminary recommendations combats bias by preventing a "change in course" if a systematic review yields results that are not to someone's liking. The results of each systematic review are presented and discussed at the final work group meeting. At this time the preliminary recommendations are modified in response to the evidence in the systematic review. All of the systematic reviews conducted for a given guideline are presented in it and, in general, all preliminary recommendations are modified.</p>
<p><strong>Defining the Strength of the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The strength of a recommendation expresses the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation. As such, the strength expresses how possible it is that a recommendation will be overturned by future evidence. It is very difficult for future evidence to overturn a recommendation that is based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect. It is much more likely that future evidence will overturn recommendations derived from a few small case series. Consequently, recommendations based on the former kind of evidence are rated as "strong" and recommendations based on the latter kind of evidence are given strength of recommendation of "weak".</p>
<p>To develop the strength of a recommendation, AAOS staff first assigned a preliminary strength rating for each recommendation that took only the quality and quantity of the available evidence into account (see 'Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations' field). Work group members then modified the preliminary strength rating using the 'Form for Assigning Grade of Recommendation (Interventions)' shown in Appendix VIII in the original guideline document. This form is based on recommendations of the GRADE Working group and requires the work group to consider the harms, benefits, and critical outcomes associated with a treatment. It also requires the work group to evaluate the applicability of the evidence. The final strength of the recommendation is assigned by the physician work group, which modifies the preliminary strength rating on the basis of these considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Development</strong></p>
<p>The recommendations and their strength were voted on using a structured voting technique known as the nominal group technique. The work group present details of this technique in Appendix IX in the original guideline document. Voting on guideline recommendations was conducted using a secret ballot and work group members were blinded to the responses of other members. If disagreement between work group members was significant, there was further discussion to see whether the disagreement(s) could be resolved. Up to three rounds of voting were held to attempt to resolve disagreements. If disagreements were not resolved following three voting rounds, no recommendation was adopted. Lack of agreement is a reason that the strength for some recommendations is labeled "Inconclusive."</p>
<p><strong>2014 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>After review of the updated 2009-2013 literature, the AAOS determined that no changes were required.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Peer Review</strong></p>
<p>The draft of the guideline and evidence report were peer reviewed by outside specialty organizations that were nominated by the physician work group prior to the development of the guideline. Peer review was accomplished using a structured peer review form (see Appendix X in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>In addition, the physician members of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Guidelines and Technology Oversight Committee, the Evidence Based Practice Committee and the Chairpersons of the AAOS Occupational Health and Workers' Compensation Committee and the Medical Liability Committee were given the opportunity to provide peer review of the draft document.</p>
<p>The work group forwarded the draft guideline to a total of 38 peer reviewers and 17 returned reviews. The disposition of all non-editorial peer review comments was documented and the guideline was modified in response to peer review. The peer reviews and the responses to them accompanied this guideline through the process of public commentary and the subsequent approval process. Peer reviewing organizations and peer reviewing individuals are listed in this document if they explicitly agree to allow them to publish this information (see Appendix X in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Public Commentary</strong></p>
<p>After modifying the draft in response to peer review, the guideline was submitted for a thirty-day period of "Public Commentary." Commentators consist of members of the AAOS Board of Directors (BOD), members of the Council on Research, Quality Assessment, and Technology (CORQAT), members of the Board of Councilors (BOC), and members of the Board of Specialty Societies (BOS). Based on these bodies, up to 185 commentators had the opportunity to provide input into the development of this guideline. Of these, 4 returned public comments.</p>
<p>For this guideline, outside specialty societies could post the confidential draft of the guideline to their "member only" website. The responses garnered from these postings were compiled by the specialty society and submitted as one succinct public commentary. In addition, members of the AAOS Board of Specialties (BOS) and Board of Councilors (BOC) were encouraged to provide input; including encouragement to seek input from colleagues not necessarily members of the BOS or BOC. As a result, the opportunity to comment on this guideline exceeds the number of public commentators for previously published AAOS guidelines as well as the numbers listed above.</p>
<p><strong>The AAOS Guideline Approval Process</strong></p>
<p>In response to the non-editorial comments submitted during the period of public commentary, the draft was again modified by the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit and physician work group members. The AAOS Guidelines and Technology Oversight Committee, the AAOS Evidence-based Practice Committee, the AAOS Council on Research, Quality Assessment, and Technology, and the AAOS Board of Directors approved the final guideline draft. Descriptions of these bodies are provided in Appendix III in the original guideline document.</p></div>
