Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 18 to 75 years of age with diabetes (type 1 and type 2) who had a nephropathy screening or monitoring test or evidence of nephropathy.</p>
<p>This measure is a component of the <a href="/browse/by-organization-indiv.aspx?orgid=8&amp;objid=49715" title="Comprehensive Diabetes Care">Comprehensive Diabetes Care</a> composite measure&mdash;one of 7 different rates&mdash;looking at how well an organization cares for the common and serious chronic disease of diabetes.</p>
<p>The denominator for all rates must be the same, with the exception of <em>HbA1c control (less than 7.0%) for a selected population</em>.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Administrative and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Administrative Specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid Specification. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Diabetes is one of the most costly and highly prevalent chronic diseases in the United States (U.S.). Approximately 26.5 million Americans have diabetes, and seven million of these cases are undiagnosed. Complications from the disease cost the country nearly $245 billion annually. In addition, diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. (American Diabetes Association, 2013). Many complications, such as amputation, blindness, and kidney failure, can be prevented if detected and addressed in the early stages. </p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Diabetes is a complex group of diseases marked by high blood glucose (blood sugar) due to the body's inability to make or use insulin. Left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to serious complications, including heart disease, stroke, hypertension, blindness, kidney disease, diseases of the nervous system, amputations, and premature death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014). </li>
    <li>Diabetes cost the nation $245 billion in 2012: $176 billion in direct medical expenses and $69 billion in disability, unemployment and premature deaths (CDC, 2014). </li>
    <li>Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (CDC, 2014). </li>
    <li>In 2012, approximately 29 million Americans had diabetes (CDC, 2014), an increase of nearly 3 million people from 2010 (CDC, 2011). </li>
    <li>Proper diabetes management is essential to control blood glucose, reduce risks of complications and prolong life. With support from health care providers, patients can manage their diabetes with self-care, taking medications as instructed, eating a healthy diet, being physically active and quitting smoking (CDC, 2014). </li>

Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test. All measures undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomial statistical analysis.</p></div>
