Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>A-C</strong>) are defined at the end of "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and unfractionated heparin do not accumulate in breast milk and do not induce an anticoagulant effect in the infant; therefore, these anticoagulants may be used in women who breastfeed. </li>
    <li>Testing for inherited thrombophilias in women who have experienced recurrent fetal loss or placental abruption is not recommended because it is unclear if anticoagulation reduces recurrence. </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to either screen for or treat women with inherited thrombophilias and obstetric histories that include complications such as fetal growth restriction or preeclampsia. </li>
    <li>Because of the lack of association between either heterozygosity or homozygosity for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism and any negative pregnancy outcomes, including any increased risk for venous thromboembolism, screening with either <em>MTHFR</em> mutation analyses or fasting homocysteine levels is not recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Recommended screening tests for inherited thrombophilias should include factor V Leiden mutation; prothrombin <em>G20210A</em> mutation; and antithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiencies. </li>
    <li>Treatment recommendations for women with inherited thrombophilias are listed in the table below. </li>
    <li>All patients with inherited thrombophilias should undergo individualized risk assessment, which may modify management decisions. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 1985 and January 2013. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists were used.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate management of inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy </li>
    <li>Decreased maternal venous thromboembolism risk </li>
    <li>Reduction of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as fetal loss, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and placental abruption </li>
</ul>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Bleeding risks associated with anticoagulation therapy </li>
    <li>To avoid paradoxical thrombosis and skin necrosis from the early antiprotein C effect of warfarin, women should continue to take therapeutic doses of unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for 5 days and until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic (2.0&ndash;3.0) for 2 consecutive days. </li>
