<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>High quality pediatric primary care is a cornerstone of efforts to improve health outcomes, control health care spending, and improve access to care. To improve the quality of pediatric primary care, a reliable and valid measure must exist. The ideal instrument is one that is brief, practical, reliable, and valid. Given the current high rate of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care, such an instrument must also be applicable regardless of insurance status and health plan membership or the presence of a regular provider of care.</p>
<p>The Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure is based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of primary care, which is similar to the American Academy of Pediatrics concept of a medical home. With the use of this definition as a criterion, the P3C was designed to measure 6 components of care (longitudinal continuity, access, contextual knowledge, communication, comprehensiveness, and coordination) that, when present, constitute high-quality primary care experiences. High scores reflect care conforming to this a priori definition.</p>
<p>The P3C measures perceptions of quality based on parents' reports of their experiences, rather than ratings of satisfaction with those experiences. The P3C was designed to measure parents' perceptions of experiences in receiving primary care, rather than the quality of a particular provider of primary care. This was done so that the care received by children without a regular provider also could be described in relation to the IOM definition of quality primary care. This is important, given the large proportions of uninsured children and children without a regular source of care who receive primary health care at emergency departments or community clinics, where they might not see a consistent provider.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A need exists for an instrument that is at once a brief, practical, reliable, and valid measure of pediatric primary care that can be used irrespective of insurance status or the presence of an established clinician-patient relationship. Although others have posited that an established clinician-patient relationship is necessary for the existence of primary care, and have therefore restricted measurement of primary care to those patients with such a relationship, the fact remains that many children, both insured and uninsured, lack a regular site of care or a regular provider of care. It behooves researchers, clinicians, and policy makers to develop and use measures that encompass the experiences of these children, as well. </li>
    <li>The ability to measure the quality of children's health care effectively is challenging because of a number of factors, including the child's dependence on caregivers, changing development, and demographics. Although some proxy measures for quality that do not depend on parents exist, such as immunization rates and frequency of screening for lead and anemia, these measures may reflect the quality of systems rather than providers. </li>
    <li>Hospital-based primary care clinics, where residents are often the primary care providers, provide care to ~21% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged families in the United States, as well as to children with chronic health care needs. With the structural challenges of resident training, there may be concerns about a lower quality of care received by patients. </li>
    <li>Access to primary care is associated with better outcomes for children with asthma, in all likelihood because the hallmarks of high-quality primary care, namely, continuity, comprehensiveness, communication, contextual knowledge, coordination, and accessibility, are key to good asthma care. However, it is well known that certain groups of children with asthma, those defined by sociodemographic and access indicators such as minority race/ethnicity, low parental education, poverty, limited English language ability, lack of insurance, no usual source of care, and unmet health care needs, are less likely to receive high-quality primary care and are more vulnerable to poor health outcomes. </li>
    <li>Children of farm workers, especially migrant farm workers, are particularly vulnerable to poor health outcomes. These children may live in families that are highly transient and may face substandard living conditions. They are likely to experience high rates of physical, mental, and oral health conditions. And children of Latino farm workers face multiple financial, cultural, and linguistic barriers to quality health care. Given the special vulnerability of this population, there is a pressing need for a brief, feasible, reliable, and valid measure of primary care characteristics for these children. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Pilot Testing</strong></p>
<p>To ensure content validity and that the Parent's Perceptions of Primary Care (P3C) measure encompasses all appropriate domains of interest, 12 groups of 3 parents each were interviewed in small-group settings at an elementary school and parents completed pilot versions of the measure. To ensure item clarity and to identify and modify unclear items, the modified instrument was then piloted with 15 additional parents at an elementary school and a preschool using cognitive interviewing methodology. </p>
<p><strong>Feasibility, Reliability and Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p>As part of a larger study to validate a measure of quality of care for vulnerable children, the P3C was administered to 3,371 parents of children in 228 classes, from kindergarten through the sixth grade, at 18 elementary schools within a large, urban school district. The percentage of missing values for the overall sample was 1.88%, indicating acceptable feasibility. Range of measurement, assessed via floor and ceiling effects, was moderate to good. Cronbach's coefficient alpha, an indicator of scale internal consistency reliability, was 0.95 for the P3C total scale. Factor analysis supported the subscale structure, and P3C scores were higher for children with health insurance, whose parents completed the survey in English, and who had a regular physician. P3C scores were positively related to parent reports of the child's health-related quality of life. These data imply that the P3C is a feasible, reliable, and valid measure of primary care characteristics, suitable for use in large, diverse community samples. Additional field testing is planned to address test-retest reliability.</p>
<p>An additional study suggests that the P3C is a feasible, reliable and valid measure of primary care characteristics for an underserved population: children of Latino farm workers.</p></div>
