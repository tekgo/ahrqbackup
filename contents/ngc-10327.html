Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Levels of evidence (<strong>I-IV</strong>) and grades of recommendation (<strong>A-C</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p>A number of papers have summarised the current approach to diagnosis. The main methods revolve around the identification of <em>Haemophilus ducreyi</em> (<em>H ducreyi</em>) by:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Detection of nucleic acid (DNA) by amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using nested techniques. There are no commercial assays available, but a number of specialised or research laboratories have published their in-house methods. </li>
    <li>Culture of material obtained from the ulcer base, or the undermined edges of the ulcer, after removing superficial pus with a cotton-tipped swab, or from pus aspirated from the bubo. The material can be plated directly onto culture medium incubated at 33&deg;C in high humidity with 5% carbon dioxide for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours. </li>
</ul>
<p>Culture media include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Gonococci</em> (GC) agar supplemented with 1% to 2% bovine haemoglobin, 5% fetal calf-serum </li>
    <li>Mueller-Hinton agar enriched with 5% chocolatised horse blood
    <p>Both of these also require supplements of 1% IsoVitaleX, and 3mg/L vancomycin to prevent overgrowth of Gram positive organisms.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Modification of these techniques by substitution of 0.2% activated charcoal instead of fetal calf serum has proven equally effective and is much cheaper. </li>
</ul>
<p>The use of more than one medium increases sensitivity, which is still low (&lt;80%). Since <em>H ducreyi</em> is a fastidious organism, specimens should be plated out directly at the clinic or sent rapidly (within 4 hours) to the laboratory; calcium alginate or plastic swabs should be used for sample collection; special transport medium may be helpful if culture media are not readily available. Confirmatory testing for oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, nitrate reduction and porphyrins can be used.</p>
<p>Microscopy of a Gram stained smear (or other stains) of material from the ulcer base or of pus aspirate from the bubo may show characteristic gram-negative coccobacilli, with occasional characteristic chaining. The test has low sensitivity and is not recommended as a diagnostic test.</p>
<p>Expert opinion has estimated that, in endemic areas, a positive <em>H ducreyi</em> culture is achievable in 60% to 80% of patients considered to have chancroid on clinical grounds. Microscopy is only 50% sensitive compared to culture, and prone to multiple errors, given the polymicrobial flora of many ulcers. PCR is the most sensitive technique, and has been demonstrated to be 95% sensitive compared to culture; conversely culture may be only 75% sensitive relative to PCR. However, PCR may be negative in a number of culture-proven chancroid cases owing to the presence of Taq polymerase inhibitors in the DNA preparations extracted from genital ulcer specimens. Multiple PCR assays have also been developed for the simultaneous amplification of DNA targets from <em>H ducreyi</em>, <em>Treponema pallidum</em> and herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2.</p>
<p><strong>Other Diagnostic Methods</strong></p>
<p>Other diagnostic tests have included various antigen-detection techniques involving immunofluorescence or radio-isotopic probes but these are not used currently in the United Kingdom (UK).</p>
<p><strong>Serology</strong></p>
<p>The detection of antibody to <em>H ducreyi</em> as a marker of chancroid has been effective in a number of epidemiological studies with enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIAs) using either lysed whole cell, lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) or outer membrane proteins (OMPs) as antigen sources. However, for the individual patient, the method lacks sensitivity, specificity (cross-reaction with other Haemophilus species) and cannot distinguish between remote and recent infection.</p>
<p>To circumvent the many problems of confirming a positive diagnosis of chancroid, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States of America (USA) have proposed that a "probable diagnosis", for both clinical and surveillance purposes be made if the patient has one or more painful genital ulcers, and (a) no evidence of <em>T pallidum</em> infection by dark field examination of ulcer exudate or by a serologic test for syphilis performed at least 7 days after onset of ulcers, and (b) the clinical presentation, appearance of the genital ulcers and regional lymphadenopathy, if present, is typical for chancroid and a test for HSV performed on the ulcer exudate is negative.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>A number of studies have found that the clinical diagnosis of genital ulcers is often unreliable with an accuracy ranging from 33% to 80%, even in areas of high prevalence and good clinical expertise. However, the true accuracy may be higher. Some of these studies suffered because of the low sensitivity of culture methods used. Previously this would not have mattered too much as syndromic management would cover the significant prevalence of mixed infections - co-infections of <em>H ducreyi</em> with <em>T pallidum</em> or HSV were frequent, occurring in over 10% of patients in many African studies. However, now that the prevalence of chancroid has decreased it is likely that the use of syndromic management too will decrease and clinical diagnosis may assume increased importance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>General Advice</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients should be advised to avoid sexual intercourse until they and their partner(s) have completed treatment and follow-up. </li>
    <li>Patients should be given a detailed explanation of their condition with particular emphasis on the long-term implications both for their health and that of their partner(s). This should be reinforced by giving them clear and accurate written information. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Further Investigations</span></strong></p>
<p>Screening for other possible causes of genital ulcerative disease should be undertaken, particularly for syphilis, genital herpes, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) or donovanosis. Full sexually transmitted disease (STD) screening should be offered. Biopsy of lymph nodes may be required to exclude neoplasia, if lymphadenopathy does not resolve following treatment.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Treatment</strong></span></p>
<p>Successful treatment of chancroid should cure infection, resolve clinical symptoms, and prevent transmission to sexual partners.</p>
<p>It should be noted that no comparative treatments have been published since 1999 in which chancroid has been confirmed by culture or PCR. The main treatment options are presented in Table 1 in the original guideline document (summarised below) and most are similar to the 2010 CDC guidelines from the USA. Evidence of their clinical efficacy has been obtained in randomised controlled trials for some (<strong>level of evidence Ib</strong>). However, grading of recommendation also takes account of ease of administration, side effects and compliance.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommended Regimens</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose (<strong>Ib, A</strong>)
    <p>or</p>
    </li>
    <li>Ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly (IM) in a single dose (<strong>Ib, B</strong>)
    <p>or </p>
    </li>
    <li>Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally in a single dose (<strong>Ib, B</strong>)
    <p>or</p>
    </li>
    <li>Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally two times a day for 3 days (<strong>Ib, B/A</strong>)
    <p>or</p>
    </li>
    <li>Erythromycin base 500 mg orally four times a day for 7 days (<strong>Ib, B/A</strong>). This is also recommended for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients rather than the single dose regimens. </li>
</ul>
<p>Azithromycin and ceftriaxone offer the advantage of single-dose therapy. They have excellent in vitro activity against <em>H ducreyi</em> with no reported resistance. However, a study comparing single dose treatment of chancroid using thiamphenicol versus azithromycin found that all 4 HIV positive cases treated with azithromycin failed therapy. Moreover, in this study chancroid was diagnosed after exclusion of syphilis by clinical characterisation of genital necrotic and painful sores and positive Gram stains and not by culture or PCR.</p>
<p>Erythromycin given at high doses for 7 days is the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended first line treatment for chancroid. Although efficacious (with cure rates of 93% noted in Kenya and India) poor compliance and gastrointestinal intolerance make alternative therapy desirable (<strong>Ib, B</strong>). Lower dosage and simpler regimens of erythromycin have been evaluated in two separate trials in Kenya. Cure rates of 91% were achieved in a randomised double blind trial of erythromycin 500 mg three times daily for 7 days (versus a single dose of ciprofloxacin) (<strong>Ib, B</strong>). The efficacy of an even shorter regimen (250 mg three times daily for 5 days) was reportedly high in a small trial conducted by the same team, but this was not a randomised comparative trial (<strong>III, C</strong>).</p>
<p>Worldwide, several isolates with intermediate resistance to either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin have been reported, thus single dose ciprofloxacin and the shorter (5-day) regimen of erythromycin may not be effective, as has been reported by teams in Rwanda and Malawi. However, a double-blind randomised-controlled trial conducted in Nairobi showed comparable cure rates for single dose ciprofloxacin (92%) and the standard 7-day course of erythromycin (91%).</p>
<p>Widespread resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) renders this cheap and once effective alternative virtually useless.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Regimens</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Oral single dose fluoroquinolones such as fleroxacin 400 mg, or norfloxacin 800 mg (<strong>Ib, B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Single dose aminoglycoside such as spectinomycin 2 g IM (<strong>IIa, B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p>Single dose thiamphenicol 5 grams dissolved in 50 ml of water in a single oral dose was effective in presumed cases of chancroid in Brazil.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Allergy</span></strong></p>
<p>Patients allergic to quinolones or cephalosporins should be treated with the erythromycin regimen.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Pregnant or Lactating Mothers and Treatment for Children</strong></p>
<p>The safety of azithromycin for pregnant and lactating women has not been established. Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated for pregnant and lactating women, children, and adolescents less than 18 years of age in which case erythromycin or ceftriaxone regimens should be used. No adverse effects of chancroid on pregnancy outcome or on the fetus have been reported.</p>
<p><strong>HIV Infection</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Probable increased incidence of delayed healing and treatment failures though evidence is conflicting. </li>
    <li>Treatment of choice is erythromycin 500 mg 4 times a day (qds) for 7 days. </li>
</ul>
<p>Patients co-infected with HIV should be closely monitored. There have been concerns that healing may be slower among HIV-infected people and treatment failures have been frequently recorded in Kenya using azithromycin, ceftriaxone, or single dose fleroxacin and in Malawi using low dose erythromycin or ciprofloxacin. A higher treatment failure rate among HIV-infected patients has, however, not been observed by the same Kenyan team in a study using low dose erythromycin or single dose ciprofloxacin. In Rwanda, researchers found that HIV and the degree of immunosuppression as measured by CD4 counts had no effect on bacteriologic and clinical outcomes, and that treatment failures were entirely attributable to resistance of <em>H ducreyi</em> to TMP-SMX. Dosage and duration of the fleroxacin regimen also needed to be increased to treat HIV-infected patients in Nairobi. CDC recommends that "since data on therapeutic efficacy with the recommended ceftriaxone and azithromycin regimens among patients infected with HIV are limited, those regimens should be used among persons known to be infected with HIV only if follow-up can be assured." Others have concluded that azithromycin should be avoided in co-infected patients. The case for using erythromycin was borne out by the acceptable response to syndromic management that was not related to HIV-1 infection when this drug was used in a study in Durban.</p>
<p>A Cochrane review done to investigate whether genital ulcer disease treatment reduced sexual acquisition of HIV identified 3 studies, 2 of which involved treatment of chancroid in Nairobi involving HIV negative men. The former trial compared fleroxacin to TMP-SMX and the latter investigated 2 different doses of fleroxacin. The cure rates for chancroid were both very high. Not surprisingly HIV acquisition was not reduced given the short follow up - presumably seroconverters would have acquired chancroid and HIV from an untreated HIV positive contact at the same time prior to any treatment. However, the conclusion of the Cochrane review was that there was insufficient evidence that treatment of genital ulcer disease reduces sexual acquisition of HIV infection. The results of this review once again demonstrate both the difficulties in designing trials that might be capable of investigating the link between sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV transmission amongst casual sex acts - one of the main determinants in the spread of HIV, and the need to undertake reviews in areas where there is significant biological plausibility in the question asked.</p>
<p><strong>Management of Fluctuant Buboes</strong></p>
<p>The classic strategy has been to needle-aspirate fluctuant buboes from adjacent healthy skin. The procedure is simpler and safer than incision, which is prone to complications (sinus formations). A randomised study conducted during an outbreak of chancroid in the USA has shown that careful incision and drainage was also an effective and safe method for treating fluctuant buboes and avoided frequent needle re-aspirations. This procedure should always be performed under effective antibiotic cover.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-Up</span></strong></p>
<p>Patients should be re-examined 3 to 7 days after initiation of therapy. If treatment is successful, ulcers improve symptomatically within 3 days and substantial re-epithelization occurs within 7 days after onset of therapy. The time required for complete healing is related to the size of the ulcer (and perhaps HIV-related immunosuppression; large ulcers may require more than 2 weeks). Clinical resolution of fluctuant lymphadenopathy is slower than that of ulcers and may require frequent needle aspiration (or drainage).</p>
<p>A test of cure is not recommended.</p>
<p>Treatment failures should warrant: (i) investigation of possible coinfections with <em>T pallidum</em> or HSV; or (ii) determination of possible resistance by isolation of <em>H ducreyi</em> and susceptibility testing by the agar dilution technique to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations but this requires a specialised laboratory.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sexual Partner(s) Management</span></strong></p>
<p>Persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has chancroid within the 10 days before onset of the patient's symptoms should be examined, and treated even in the absence of symptoms, as asymptomatic carriage of <em>H ducreyi</em> has been proven to occur, but screening is not recommended.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Guideline development is undertaken by a multi-disciplinary writing committee with membership determined in a transparent manner. The chair is chosen by the Clinical Effectiveness Group (CEG). The CEG lead then discusses with the chair what suggestions they might have for members from other disciplines. The additional members of the group are then invited by the CEG. Writing committee membership includes relevant professional groups (for example genitourinary medicine physicians, nurses, health advisors, pharmacists, microbiologists and other professionals from allied specialties as appropriate) and when relevant this will involve working with the appropriate British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) Special Interest Group (SIG) and the BASHH audit group.</p>
<p>Patients' views and preferences are sought and considered and the process documented. This may include patient representative involvement in the writing committee, information obtained from patient interview or surveys during the writing and/or piloting process, reviewing published work on patient experiences or involving patient associations. The chair of the writing group identifies an appropriate member such as the Health Advisor to get patient feedback on the guideline. BASHH is currently developing a public panel to assist with its work and in the future this group could be approached to assist in guideline development.</p>
<p>Recommendations are formulated with consideration of their health benefits, side effects and risks, with evidence presented in the guideline that these issues have been addressed. Each recommendation is linked to the supporting evidence with a list of relevant references.</p>
<p>Consideration is given to pragmatic and organisational issues relevant to the guideline. This is sought during and may emerge from the piloting of the guideline.</p>
<p>The authors consider the financial cost implications of recommendations made. Where disagreement arises within the writing committee with regard to recommendations the chair attempts to resolve these (for example by a voting system or formal consensus method). The process is documented and reported to the CEG editor. When this is not possible the CEG will review the evidence themselves and invite the chair and possibly other members of the writing committee to a meeting to agree a resolution and final recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The initial draft of the guideline, including the patient information leaflet (PIL) was piloted for validation by the Clinical Effectiveness Group (CEG).</p>
<p>The final guideline was then reviewed by the CEG using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument before posting it on the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) website for external peer review for a two month period. Comments received were collated by the CEG editor and sent to the guideline chair for review and action. The final guideline was approved by the CEG and a review date agreed before publication on the BASHH website.</p>
<p>The rare nature of this disease precluded the review of this guideline by a patient suffering from chancroid. However, the guideline was reviewed by the BASHH <em>Patient and Public Engagement</em> panel which includes members of the public, representatives of sexual health voluntary sector organisations, young people's groups and sexual health professionals.</p></div>
