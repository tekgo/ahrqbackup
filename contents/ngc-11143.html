Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the level of evidence (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) and strength of the recommendations (<strong>Grade A-C</strong>) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ovarian Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Based on the available data, the Practice Committee can be reasonably reassured that there is no meaningful increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer following the use of fertility drugs in infertile women. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Based on the available data there is fair evidence that the risk of invasive ovarian cancer is not different with one fertility drug compared with another. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>While several studies have shown a small increase in the absolute risk of borderline ovarian tumors after fertility treatments, there is insufficient consistent evidence that a particular fertility drug increases the risk of borderline ovarian tumors. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>It is important to note that any absolute increase in risk is small, and these tumors are indolent and generally have a favorable prognosis. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend against the use of fertility medications to avoid borderline ovarian tumors. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breast Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>There is fair evidence that fertility drugs are not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Endometrial Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Overall, there is fair evidence that fertility drugs are not associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Cancers</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Overall, there is fair evidence that fertility drugs are not associated with an increased risk of invasive thyroid cancer. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Overall, there is insufficient evidence that fertility drugs are associated with an increased risk of melanoma. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Overall, there is fair evidence that fertility drugs are not associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Based on a single study, there is insufficient evidence that fertility drugs are associated with an increased risk of lymphoma. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Overall, there is fair evidence that fertility drugs are not associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Given the available literature, patients should be counseled that infertile women may be at an increased risk of invasive ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancer; however, use of fertility drugs does not appear to increase this risk. </li>
    <li>While several studies have shown a small increase in the absolute risk of borderline ovarian tumors after fertility treatments, there is insufficient consistent evidence that a particular fertility drug increases the risk of borderline ovarian tumors. </li>
    <li>It is important to note that borderline ovarian tumors are indolent and generally have a favorable prognosis, and any absolute increase in risk related to fertility drugs is small. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to recommend against the use of fertility medications to avoid borderline ovarian tumors. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized, controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grade A</strong>: There is good evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p>
<p><strong>Grade B</strong>: There is fair evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p>
<p><strong>Grade C</strong>: There is insufficient evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The importance of understanding any existing relationship between fertility medications and cancer risk is crucial because the use of these medications has become quite common, with approximately 1 million in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles reported per year worldwide in addition to an unknown number of ovulation
induction cycles.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Based on available data, there does not appear to be a meaningful increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or endometrial cancer following the use of fertility drugs. Several studies have shown a small increased risk of borderline ovarian tumors; however, there is insufficient consistent evidence that a particular fertility drug increases the risk of borderline ovarian tumors, and any absolute risk is small.</p></div>
