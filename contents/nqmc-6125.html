<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Although great strides have been made in cancer treatment, over one-third of patients with advanced stage cancer will die within 6 months of diagnosis. While much of the oncology literature focuses on the prevention and early, potentially curative treatment of malignancies, palliation of the symptoms of metastatic cancer and its treatment and end of life care are essential for half of the people diagnosed with cancer. </p>
<p>Because symptoms are common and high impact, better symptom management offers a critical opportunity to relieve the burden of living with cancer. Systematic reviews identify pain, fatigue, anorexia, and breathlessness among the most common symptoms. Pooled estimates for the prevalence of symptoms in patients with advanced cancer range from 74% for fatigue to 11% for rash and for diarrhea (pain 71%, anorexia 53%, depression 39%, constipation 37%, insomnia 36%, dyspnea 35%, nausea 31%, cognitive symptoms 28%, oral symptoms 20%, vomiting 20%). Pain remains strikingly common and may affect more than a third of patients with earlier stage disease and more than two-thirds of patients with advanced cancer. The Institute of Medicine targeted improving cancer pain as a national priority. </p>
<p>Good supportive care encompasses four important areas: (1) treatment of cancer-related symptoms (2) prevention and treatment of the side-effects associated with cancer treatment, (3) recognition of and support for patients' experiencing psychosocial distress and (4) end of life care. </p>
<p>The Cancer Quality-ASSIST (Assessing Symptoms Side Effects and Indicators of Supportive Treatment) indicator set was developed to provide tools to assess the extent to which cancer care addresses the symptomatic and informational needs of patients and families. </p></div>

<h2>Evaluation of Measure Properties

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A team of researchers developed an initial potential set of indicators based on a systematic review of clinical trials, guidelines, and quality indicators. An expert panel evaluated the validity and feasibility of potential quality indicators using a formal rating and consensus process, and thereby guided the selection of final indicators. Of 133 proposed quality indicators, a total of 92 (69%) were judged valid and feasible by the panel. In a pilot study of the 92 medical record-based Cancer Quality-ASSIST (Assessing Symptoms Side Effects and Indicators of Supportive Treatment) supportive oncology quality indicators, following development and implementation of an abstraction tool, use of trained abstractors, and analysis of quantitative and qualitative abstraction results, including interrater reliability, 41 met strict criteria for feasibility, reliability and validity for advanced cancer across two clinical settings. These indicators represent all domains of the original ASSIST set except mucositis, insomnia, and fever/neutropenia. Overall kappa for the included set of indicators was 0.87 for eligibility and 0.86 for specified care.</p></div>
