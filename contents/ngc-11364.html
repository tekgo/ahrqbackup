<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The following question framed the review: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice for adults with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions? </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Method</span></strong> </p>
<p>Search terms for the review were developed by the research methodologist to the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) Evidence-based Practice (EBP) Project and AOTA staff, in consultation with the review authors, and by the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to make sure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. Table E.1 in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to population (arthritis and other rheumatic conditions) and types of intervention included in the systematic review. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted the search and confirmed and improved the search strategies.</p>
<p>Databases and sites searched included MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ergonomics Abstracts, and OTseeker. In addition, consolidated information sources, such as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were included in the search. These databases are peer-reviewed summaries of journal articles and provide a system for clinicians and scientists to conduct systematic reviews of selected clinical questions and topics. Moreover, reference lists from articles included in the systematic review were examined for potential articles, and selected journals were hand searched to ensure that all appropriate articles were included.</p>
<p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria are critical to the systematic review process because they provide the structure for the quality, type, and years of publication of the literature that is incorporated into a review. The review of the question was limited to peer-reviewed scientific literature published in English. The intervention approaches examined were within the scope of practice of occupational therapy. The literature included in the review was published between January 1995 and June 2014. The review excluded data from presentations, conference proceedings, non&ndash;peer-reviewed research literature, dissertations, and theses. Studies included in the review provide Level I, II, and III evidence. </p>
<p>A total of 9,661 citations and abstracts were included in the review. The research methodologist for the EBP Project completed the first step of eliminating references on the basis of citation and abstract. The systematic review was carried out as an academic partnership in which the three authors worked with graduate students as a team. The review team completed the next step of eliminating references on the basis of citations and abstracts. The full-text versions of potential articles were retrieved, and the review team determined final inclusion in the review on the basis of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The team working on the focused question reviewed the articles according to their quality (scientific rigor and lack of bias) and level of evidence. Each article included in the review was then abstracted using an evidence table that provides a summary of the methods and findings of the article. American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) staff and the Evidence-based Practice (EBP) Project research methodologist reviewed the evidence table to ensure quality control. All studies are summarized in the evidence tables in Appendix F in the original guideline document. In addition, articles of relevance from the systematic review of forearm, wrist, and hand (Roll &amp; Hardison, 2017) were included in this Practice Guideline. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the methods described by Higgins, Altman, and Sterne (2011). The method for assessing the risk of bias of systematic reviews was based on the measurement tool developed by Shea et al. (2007).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A major focus of the American Occupational Therapy Association's (AOTA's) Evidence-based Practice (EBP) projects is an ongoing program of systematic review of multidisciplinary scientific literature, using focused questions and standardized procedures to identify occupational therapy&ndash;relevant evidence and discuss its implications for practice, education, and research. An evidence-based perspective is founded on the assumption that scientific evidence of the effectiveness of occupational therapy intervention can be judged to be more or less strong and valid according to a hierarchy of research designs, an assessment of the quality of the research, the significance of the findings, or a combination of the three.</p>
<p>AOTA uses standards of evidence modeled on those developed in evidence-based medicine. This model standardizes and ranks the value of scientific evidence for biomedical practice. In this system, the highest level of evidence, Level I, includes systematic reviews of the literature, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In RCTs, participants are randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group, and the outcomes of both groups are compared. Other levels of evidence include Level II studies, in which assignment to a treatment or a control group is not randomized; Level III studies, which do not have a control group; Level IV studies, which use a single-case experimental design, sometimes reported over several participants; and Level V studies, which are case reports and expert opinions that include narrative literature reviews and consensus statements.</p>
<p>The systematic review on arthritis and other rheumatic conditions was supported by AOTA as part of the EBP Project. AOTA is committed to supporting the role of occupational therapy in this important area of practice. </p>
<p>A search for arthritis and other rheumatic conditions was completed for articles published January 1995 through June 2014. This review was completed together with systematic reviews of musculoskeletal disorders that included interventions for people with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis specific to the forearm, wrist, and hand and the lower extremity. These reviews are crucial because occupational therapy practitioners need access to the results of the latest and best available literature to support interventions for people with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions within the scope of occupational therapy practice.</p>
<p>The research question for the systematic review on arthritis and other rheumatic conditions was reviewed by review authors, an advisory group of experts in the field, AOTA staff, and the methodology consultant to the AOTA EBP Project. </p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The studies that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic reviews did not explicitly report potential adverse events associated with the interventions evaluated in these studies. If harms were noted, they would have been explicitly reported in the summary of key findings and would have been taken into account in the determination of the recommendations. Before implementing any new intervention with a client, it is always prudent for occupational therapy practitioners to be aware of the potential benefits and harms of the intervention. </p></div>
