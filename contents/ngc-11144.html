Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the level of the evidence (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) and strength of the recommendations (<strong>Grade A-C</strong>) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who Is at High Risk for Moderate and Severe Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is fair evidence (<strong>level II-2</strong>) that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), elevated antim&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) values, peak estradiol levels, multifollicular development, and a high number of oocytes retrieved are associated with an increased risk of OHSS. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>While cut points require validation, AMH values &gt;3.4 ng/mL, antral follicle count (AFC) &gt;24, development of &ge;25 follicles, estradiol values &gt;3,500 pg/mL, or &ge;24 oocytes retrieved are particularly associated with an increased risk of OHSS. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prevention of OHSS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Does the Type of Stimulation Protocol Influence the Risk of OHSS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is good evidence to support the use of ovarian stimulation protocols using gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists in order to reduce the risk of OHSS. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence that clomiphene independently reduces OHSS risk. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can Aspirin Reduce the Risk of OHSS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence that aspirin reduces the incidence of OHSS based on a single randomized trial comparing aspirin alone with no treatment and another study comparing combined acetylsalicylic acid and steroid treatment with no treatment. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Can Metformin Reduce the Risk of OHSS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is good evidence that metformin decreases the risk of OHSS risk in PCOS patients. (<strong>Grade A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Can Coasting Reduce the Risk of OHSS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend coasting for the prevention of OHSS. (<strong>Grade C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Choice of Trigger for Final Oocyte Maturation Prior to Retrieval</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend a lower dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to trigger oocyte maturation for reduction in OHSS risk based on one underpowered randomized trial. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is good evidence to recommend the use of a GnRH agonist to trigger oocyte maturation prior to oocyte retrieval in order to reduce the risk of OHSS. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is good evidence that live-birth rates are lower in fresh autologous cycles after GnRH trigger, but not donor-recipient cycles. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is fair evidence that reproductive outcomes are improved when a low dose of hCG is co-administered at the time of GnRH agonist trigger for luteal support. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dopamine Agonist</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is good evidence that dopamine agonist administration starting at the time of hCG trigger for several days reduces the incidence of OHSS. (<strong>Grade A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Can Albumin Prevent OHSS Risk?</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>Given mixed results in the literature, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively state that albumin lowers the risk of OHSS. (<strong>Grade C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Can Calcium Prevent OHSS Risk?</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence that calcium lowers OHSS risk. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Can Cryopreservation Prevent OHSS Risk?</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>Based on the results of two small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there is fair evidence that cryopreservation prevents OHSS. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Can Miscellaneous Treatments Prevent OHSS Risk</strong>?</p>
<p>There are insufficient data to make recommendations regarding the use of luteal antagonist administration, letrozole, methylprednisolone, intramuscular progesterone, or ketoconazole to mitigate OHSS risk.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of OHSS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Does Outpatient Paracentesis of Women with OHSS Improve Their Outcome?</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence to recommend paracenteses or culdocenteses for the management of OHSS in an outpatient setting. (<strong>Grade B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Do Volume Expanders Improve Outcome for Women with OHSS?</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support the use of volume expanders alone for the treatment of OHSS (<strong>Grade C</strong>). The studies reporting use of volume expanders in OHSS treatment have not been uniform in treatment protocols. Some use diuretics and others include dopamine.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Women with PCOS, elevated AMH values, and elevated AFC may benefit from ovarian stimulation protocols that reduce the risk of OHSS. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Ovarian stimulation protocols using GnRH antagonists are preferable in women at high risk of OHSS. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>The use of a GnRH agonist to trigger oocyte maturation prior to oocyte retrieval is recommended to reduce the risk of OHSS if peak estradiol levels are high or multifollicular development occurs during stimulation. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) Low-dose hCG co-trigger, luteal hormonal support, or cryopreservation of embryos are strategies that may improve pregnancy rates in this setting. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Dopamine agonist administration starting at the time of hCG trigger for several days also may be used to reduce the incidence of OHSS. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Additional strategies to prevent OHSS which may be helpful include the use of metformin in PCOS patients (<strong>Grade A</strong>), aspirin administration (<strong>Grade A</strong>), and cryopreservation of embryos. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The mainstay of OHSS treatment includes fluid resuscitation and prophylactic anticoagulation. Paracentesis or culdocentesis may be recommended for management of OHSS when a large amount of ascites is present. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized, controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grade A</strong>: There is good evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A systematic review of the literature was performed in the electronic database MEDLINE through PubMed, with a filter for human subject and English research, on September 10, 2015.</p>
<p>A combination of the following medical subject headings or text words were used: acetylsalicylic acid, age, albumin, ASA, ascites, aspirin, BMI, body mass index, calcium, clinical trial, clomiphene, enoxaparin, freeze, freeze-all, heparin, "last 5 years," Lovenox, obes*, metformin, OHSS, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, paracentesis, prevention, prednisolone, prednisone, risk factors, *stimulation, treatment (limited to "clinical trial"), and weight*.</p>
<p>Initially, titles and abstracts of potentially relevant articles were screened and reviewed for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Protocols and results of the studies were examined according to specific inclusion criteria. Only studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed in the final analysis. Studies were eligible if they met one of the following criteria: primary evidence (clinical trials) that assessed the effectiveness of a procedure correlated with an outcome measure (pregnancy, implantation, or live-birth rates); meta-analyses; and relevant articles from bibliographies of identified articles.</p>
