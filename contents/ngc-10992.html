<h2>Recommendations

<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, <strong>very low</strong>) and the strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Colonoscopy and Perioperative Clearing in Patients with Cancer of the Colon or Rectum</strong></span></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) undergo high-quality perioperative clearing with colonoscopy. The procedure should be performed preoperatively, or within a 3- to 6-month interval after surgery in the case of obstructive CRC. The goals of perioperative clearing colonoscopy are detection of synchronous cancer and detection and complete resection of precancerous polyps. (<em><strong>Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong></em>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Colonoscopy and Prevention of Metachronous Cancer after Surgery for Colon and for Rectal Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that patients who have undergone curative resection of either colon or rectal cancer receive their first surveillance colonoscopy 1 year after surgery (or 1 year after the clearing perioperative colonoscopy). Additional surveillance recommendations apply to patients with rectal cancer (see "Additional Considerations in Surveillance of Rectal Cancer" below). (<em><strong>Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong></em>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that, after the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (i.e., 4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy) and then 5 years (i.e., 9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy). Subsequent colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. If neoplastic polyps are detected, the intervals between colonoscopies should be in accordance with published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals. These intervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome. (<em><strong>Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong></em>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Additional Considerations in Surveillance of Rectal Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>Patients with localized rectal cancer who have undergone surgery without total mesorectal excision, those who have undergone transanal local excision (i.e., transanal excision or transanal endoscopic microsurgery) or endoscopic submucosal dissection, and those with locally advanced rectal cancer who did not receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation and then surgery using total mesorectal excision techniques are at increased risk for local recurrence. In these situations, the Task Force suggests local surveillance with flexible sigmoidoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) every 3 to 6 months for the first 2 to 3 years after surgery. These surveillance measures are in addition to recommended colonoscopic surveillance for metachronous neoplasia. (<em><strong>Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives and Adjuncts to Colonoscopy</strong></p>
<p><em>Computed Tomographic Colonography (CTC)</em></p>
<p>In patients with obstructive CRC precluding complete colonoscopy, the Task Force recommends CTC as the best alternative to exclude synchronous neoplasms. Double-contrast barium enema is an acceptable alternative if CTC is not available. (<em><strong>Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong></em>)</p>
<p><em>Fecal Tests</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) or fecal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for surveillance after CRC resection. </p>

<p><strong>Strength of the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong recommendations</strong> mean that most informed patients would choose the recommended management and that clinicians can structure their interactions with patients accordingly. </p>
<p><strong>Weak recommendations</strong> mean that patients' choices will vary according to their values and preferences, and clinicians must ensure that patients' care is in keeping with their values and preferences. </p>
<p>Weaker recommendations are indicated by phrases such as "the Task Force suggests," whereas stronger recommendations are stated as "the Task Force recommends."</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The English-language medical literature was searched using MEDLINE (2005 to September 30, 2015), EMBASE (2005 to September 30, 2015), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews and Effects (2005 to October 7, 2015), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005 to October 7, 2015). In MEDLINE, subject headings for colorectal neoplasms were combined with the subheading for surgery, resection, postoperative, colectomy, curative, survivor, survival, neoplasm recurrence, second primary neoplasms, and treatment outcome. The resulting set was combined with subject and keywords for colonoscopy or follow-up studies. Similar searches were performed in EMBASE, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews and Effects, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Case reports and studies performed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, prior colorectal cancer (CRC), or hereditary CRC syndromes were excluded. Review papers, meta-analyses, gastroenterology textbooks, and editorials were searched manually for additional references. Data from studies with no explicit documentation that perioperative colonoscopic clearing had been performed were not included in the overall summary tables, but some of these studies are referred to in the discussion of the evidence. The review includes studies published since 2005, but also incorporates older evidence used to draft the 2006 guidelines. </p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) grades the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using an adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The GRADE process categorizes the quality of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). This categorization is based on an assessment of the study design (e.g., randomized controlled trial or observational study), study limitations, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision, and publication bias. The USMSTF members conduct literature searches to identify published papers that address the key issues discussed within these recommendations. These publications are supplemented both by review of citations from the identified papers as well as other key references elicited from the subject matter experts on the Task Force. The GRADE process involves the collection of literature, analysis, summary (often as meta-analysis), and a separate review of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The USMSTF members employ a modified, qualitative approach for this assessment based on exhaustive and critical review of evidence, without a traditional meta-analysis. The GRADE process separates evaluation of the quality of the evidence to support a recommendation from the strength of that recommendation. This is done in recognition of the fact that, although the quality of the evidence impacts the strength of the recommendation, other factors can influence a recommendation, such as side effects, patient preferences, values, and cost.</p></div>
