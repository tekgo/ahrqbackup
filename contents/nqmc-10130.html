Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percent of acute ischemic stroke patients 18 years of age and older who arrive at the hospital within 2 hours of time last known well and for whom intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) was initiated at the hospital within 3 hours of time last known well.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The administration of thrombolytic agents to carefully screened, eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke has been shown to be beneficial in several clinical trials. These included two positive randomized controlled trials in the United States (U.S.): the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Studies, Part I and Part II. Based on the results of these studies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV r-TPA or t-PA) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke when given within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset. A large meta-analysis controlling for factors associated with stroke outcome confirmed the benefit of IV t-PA in patients treated within 3 hours of symptom onset. While controversy still exists among some specialists, the major society practice guidelines developed in the United States all recommend the use of IV t-PA for eligible patients. Physicians with experience and skill in stroke management and the interpretation of computed tomography (CT) scans should supervise treatment.</p>
<p>The European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) III trial indicated that intravenous r-TPA can be given safely to, and can improve outcomes for, carefully selected patients treated 3 to 4.5 hours after stroke; however, as the NINDS investigators concluded, the earlier that IV thrombolytic therapy is initiated, the better the patient outcome. Therefore, the target for IV t-PA initiation remains within 3 hours of time last known well. The administration of IV thrombolytic therapy beyond 3 hours of stroke symptom onset has not been FDA approved.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Stroke ranks as the number five cause of death in the United States, following diseases of the heart, cancer, and chronic lung-related diseases. Each year, approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke. Approximately 610,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent strokes. These numbers equate to one stroke victim every 40 seconds on average. According to 2010 mortality data, one of every 20 deaths in the United States is attributable to stroke. Women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke than men. Lifetime risk of stroke among those 55 to 75 years of age was 1 in 5 for women (20% to 21%) and approximately 1 in 6 for men (14% to 17%). Blacks have a risk of first-ever stroke that is almost twice that of whites (American Heart Association [AHA], 2015). </li>
    <li>Stroke is also a leading cause of long-term disability (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009). Data from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) revealed that 50% of ischemic stroke survivors age greater than 65 years had some hemiparesis; 35% experienced depressive symptoms; 30% were unable to ambulate without assistance; 26% were dependent in activities of daily living; 19% had aphasia; and 26% were institutionalized in a nursing home. The mean lifetime cost of ischemic stroke, including inpatient care, rehabilitation, and follow-up as necessary for residual deficits are estimated at $140,048 per person (AHA, 2015). </li>
    <li>Thrombolytic therapy is one of the most promising treatments for acute ischemic stroke. The majority of strokes are due to blockage of an artery in the brain by a blood clot. Prompt treatment with clot dissolving (thrombolytic) drugs can restore blood flow before major brain damage has occurred. In the United States (U.S.), Canada, and most European countries, alteplase/recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been approved for use within three hours of stroke symptom onset. Successful treatment is likely to improve neurological outcomes for ischemic stroke patients at three months and later; however, intracranial hemorrhage is a serious complication of therapy and may be fatal (Adams et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Clinical practice guidelines for intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA (Adams et al., 2007) cite the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) rt-PA Stroke Study (1995), which partially supported the approval of rt-PA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NINDS trial was conducted in two consecutive parts. Part A trials in the 1980s studied very low doses of thrombolytic therapy, given daily by intravenous route for several days. The onset of treatment occurred anytime from 5 to 14 days post symptom onset. Part A trials did not collect data on functional outcome. Part B trials from the 1990s and later used a single large dose of thrombolytic drug (80 to 100 mg rt-PA), given intravenously (IV) or intra-arterially (IA) within three, six, nine, or 24 hours of stroke. The primary end point in Part B of the study was a favorable outcome, defined as complete or nearly complete neurological recovery 3 months after stroke. Favorable outcomes were achieved in 31% to 50% of patients treated with rt-PA, as compared to 20% to 38% of patients given placebo (Kwiatkowski et al., 1999). The benefit was similar one year after stoke. The major risk of treatment was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage which occurred in 6.4% of patients treated with rt-PA and 0.6% of patients given placebo (Marler et al., 2000). </li>
    <li>In 2008, European Cooperative Acute Stoke Study (ECASS)-3, a multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, studied the administration of rt-PA between three and 4.5 hours of stroke symptom onset (Hacke et al., 2008). The trial enrolled 418 patients treated with rt-PA per the current dosing guidelines (i.e., 0.9 mg/kg [maximum of 90 mg] with 10% given as an initial IV bolus and the remainder infused over one hour) and compared them with 403 who were given placebo. The frequency of the primary efficacy outcome (i.e., modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days after treatment) was significantly greater with rt-PA (52.4%) than with placebo (45.2%; odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.76; risk ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.34; P=0.04). The point estimate for the degree of benefit seen in ECASS-3 (OR for global favorable outcome, 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.65) was less than the point estimate of benefit found in the pool of patients enrolled for 0 to 3 hours after stroke symptom onset in the NINDS study (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.9). </li>
    <li>Currently, researchers, along with the field, continue to debate the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage with IV rt-PA in certain patient populations; however, the benefit of improved functional outcomes, and potential improvements in quality of life outweighs the decision to withhold treatment of the ischemia (Saposnik et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Although the expanded timeframe of 3 to 4.5 hours for thrombolytic therapy was found to be effective for ischemic stroke patients and without significant increase in hemorrhagic events, the debate remains as to the benefit of the extended time frame. A treatment target of 3 hours remains the accepted recommendation as studies have shown the potential opportunity for improved outcomes is greater with earlier treatment. Delays in evaluation and initiation of therapy for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke should be avoided. </li>
</ul>
