Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) admissions with an order for a prophylactic intravenous (IV) antibiotic for prevention of surgical site infection, who received the prophylactic antibiotic on time.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Surgical Infection Prevention performance measure states, "Surgical site infections occur in 2 to 5 percent of clean extra-abdominal surgeries and up to 20 percent of intra-abdominal surgeries. Each infection is estimated to increase a hospital stay by an average of 7 days and add over $3,000 in charges (1992 data). Patients who develop surgical site infections are 60 percent more likely to spend time in an intensive care unit (ICU), five times more likely to be readmitted to the hospital, and have twice the incidence of mortality. Despite advances in infection control practices, surgical site infections remain a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. Studies indicate that appropriate preoperative administration of antibiotics is effective in preventing infection. Systemic and process changes that promote compliance with established guidelines and standards can decrease infectious morbidity" (2002).</p>
<p>There is no literature available on variation in adherence to recommended prophylactic intravenous (IV) antibiotic timing among Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) providers. However, variability in the accuracy of timing of administration has been demonstrated in other settings. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Practice Guidelines </strong><br />
This performance measure is aligned with current surgical infection prevention guidelines recommending that prophylactic antibiotics be administered within one hour prior to surgical incision, or within two hours prior to incision when vancomycin or fluoroquinolones are used.</p></div>
