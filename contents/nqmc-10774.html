Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of major depression or persistent depressive disorder with documentation of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria at the time of the diagnosis.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients accurately diagnosed with major depression or persistent depressive disorder.</p>
<p>At any given time, 9% of the population has a depressive disorder, and 3.4% has major depression (Strine et al., 2008). In a 12-month time period, 6.6% of the U.S. population will have experienced major depression, and 16.6% of the population will experience depression in their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).</p>
<p>Major depression is a treatable cause of pain, suffering, disability and death, yet primary care clinicians detect major depression in only one-third to one-half of their patients with major depression (Williams et al., 2002; Schonfeld et al., 1997). Additionally, more than 80% of patients with depression have a medical comorbidity (Klinkman, 2003). Usual care for depression in the primary care setting has resulted in only about half of depressed adults getting treated (Kessler et al., 2005) and only 20% to 40% showing substantial improvement over 12 months (Un&uuml;tzer et al., 2002; Katon et al., 1999). Approximately 70% to 80% of antidepressants are prescribed in primary care, making it critical that clinicians know how to use them and have a system that supports best practices (Mojtabai &amp; Olfson, 2008).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure

<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depression was second only to back and neck pain for having the greatest effect on disability days, at 386.6 million United States (U.S.) days per year (Merikangas et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>In a World Health Organization (WHO) study of more than 240,000 people across 60 countries, depression was shown to produce the greatest decrease in quality of health compared to several other chronic diseases. Health scores worsened when depression was a comorbid condition, and the most disabling combination was depression and diabetes (Moussavi et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>A 2011 study showed a relationship between the severity of depression symptoms and work function. Data was analyzed from 771 depressed patients who were currently employed. The data showed that for every 1-point increase in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score, patients experienced an additional mean productivity loss of 1.65%. And, even minor levels of depression symptoms were associated with decrements in work function (Beck et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>In the U.S., depression costs employers $24 billion in lost productive work time (Stewart et al., 2003). </li>
    <li>There is evidence that non-majority racial and cultural groups in the U.S. are less likely to be treated for depression than European Americans. In an epidemiological study that compared rates of diagnosing and treating depression in the early 1990s to patterns 10 years later, only 4.9% of minorities were treated with antidepressants compared to 12.4% of non-Hispanic Caucasians (Mojtabai &amp; Olfson, 2008). </li>
    <li>Depression in the elderly is widespread, often undiagnosed and usually untreated. It is a common misperception that it is a part of normal aging. Losses, social isolation and chronic medical problems that older patients experience can contribute to depression. </li>
    <li>The rate of depression in adults older than 65 years of age treated in primary care settings ranges from 17% to 37% (Birrer &amp; Vemuri, 2004) and is between 14% and 42% in patients who live in long-term care facilities (Robinson et al., 2014). Comorbidities are more common in the elderly. The highest rates of depression are found in those with strokes (30% to 60%), coronary artery disease (up to 44%), cancer (up to 40%), Parkinson's disease (40%), Alzheimer's disease (20% to 40%), and dementia (17% to 31%) (Birrer &amp; Vemuri, 2004). The recurrence rate is also extremely high at 40% (Birrer &amp; Vemuri, 2004). </li>
    <li>Between 14% and 23% of pregnant women and 10% to 15% of postpartum women will experience a depressive disorder (Gaynes et al., 2005). A review by Milgrom and Gemmill (2014) cites a point prevalence of 13% at three months after delivery and an average of 9% during each trimester of pregnancy. According to a large-scale epidemiological study by Vesga-L&oacute;pez et al. (2008), depression during the postpartum period may be more common than at other times in a woman's life. </li>
    <li>With growing understanding of the systemic impact of perinatal stressors, there is a new body of research examining paternal depression. A recent meta-analysis shows a 10% to 14% incidence of paternal depression during the perinatal period, with a moderate positive correlation with maternal depression (Paulson &amp; Bazemore, 2010). </li>
    <li>From 50% to 85% of people who suffer an episode of major depression will have a recurrence, usually within two or three years (American Psychiatric Association, 2010). Patients who have had three or more episodes of major depression are at 90% risk of having another episode. </li>

<h3>
Financial Disclosures/Other Potential Conflicts of Interest
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) has long had a policy of transparency in declaring potential conflicting and competing interests of all individuals who participate in the development, revision and approval of ICSI guidelines and protocols. </p>
<p>In 2010, the ICSI Conflict of Interest Review Committee was established by the Board of Directors to review all disclosures and make recommendations to the board when steps should be taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, including recommendations regarding removal of work group members. This committee has adopted the Institute of Medicine Conflict of Interest standards as outlined in the report Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2011). </p>
<p>Where there are work group members with identified potential conflicts, these are disclosed and discussed at the initial work group meeting. These members are expected to recuse themselves from related discussions or authorship of related recommendations, as directed by the Conflict of Interest committee or requested by the work group.</p>
<p>The complete ICSI policy regarding Conflicts of Interest is available at the <a href="https://www.icsi.org/_asset/fwsfmi/coi_policyletter.pdf" title="ICSI Web site">ICSI Web site</a>.</p>
