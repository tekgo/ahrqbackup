<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The guideline was developed by the National Guideline Centre on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance and related appendices.</p>
<p>The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example, words such as 'offer' and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation) and is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Identifying People with Suspected Sepsis</span></strong></p>
<p>This guidance should be used together with the algorithms organised by age group and treatment location and the risk stratification tools in the original guideline document (see the "Clinical Algorithm[s]" field).</p>
<p>Think 'could this be sepsis?' if a person presents with signs or symptoms that indicate possible infection.</p>
<p>Take into account that people with sepsis may have non-specific, non-localised presentations, for example, feeling very unwell, and may not have a high temperature.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to concerns expressed by the person and their family or carers, for example, changes from usual behaviour.</p>
<p>Assess people who might have sepsis with extra care if they cannot give a good history (for example, people with English as a second language or people with communication problems).</p>
<p>Assess people with any suspected infection to identify:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Possible source of infection </li>
    <li>Factors that increase risk of sepsis (see "Risk Factors for Sepsis," below) </li>
    <li>Any indications of clinical concern, such as new onset abnormalities of behaviour, circulation or respiration </li>
</ul>
<p>Identify factors that increase risk of sepsis (see "Risk Factors for Sepsis," below) or indications of clinical concern such as new onset abnormalities of behaviour, circulation or respiration when deciding during a remote assessment whether to offer a face-to-face-assessment and if so, on the urgency of face-to-face assessment.</p>
<p>Use a structured set of observations (see "Face-to-face Assessment of People with Suspected Sepsis," below) to assess people in a face-to-face setting to stratify risk (see "Stratifying Risk of Severe Illness or Death from Sepsis," below) if sepsis is suspected.</p>
<p>Consider using an early warning score to assess people with suspected sepsis in acute hospital settings.</p>
<p>Suspect neutropenic sepsis in patients having anticancer treatment who become unwell. (This recommendation is from NICE's guideline on neutropenic sepsis [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/38445/" title="Guideline #9334" target="_blank">Neutropenic sepsis: prevention and management of neutropenic sepsis in cancer patients</a>].)</p>
<p>Refer patients with suspected neutropenic sepsis immediately for assessment in secondary or tertiary care. (This recommendation is from NICE's guideline on neutropenic sepsis [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/38445/" title="Guideline #9334" target="_blank">Neutropenic sepsis: prevention and management of neutropenic sepsis in cancer patients</a>].)</p>
<p>Treat people with neutropenic sepsis in line with NICE's guideline on neutropenic sepsis (see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/38445/" title="Guideline #9334" target="_blank">Neutropenic sepsis: prevention and management of neutropenic sepsis in cancer patients</a>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk Factors for Sepsis</span></strong></p>
<p>Take into account that people in the groups below are at higher risk of developing sepsis:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The very young (under 1 year) and older people (over 75 years) or people who are very frail </li>
    <li>People who have impaired immune systems because of illness or drugs, including:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>People being treated for cancer with chemotherapy (see "Identifying People with Suspected Sepsis," above) </li>
        <li>People who have impaired immune function (for example, people with diabetes, people who have had a splenectomy, or people with sickle cell disease) </li>
        <li>People taking long-term steroids </li>
        <li>People taking immunosuppressant drugs to treat non-malignant disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>People who have had surgery, or other invasive procedures, in the past 6 weeks </li>
    <li>People with any breach of skin integrity (for example, cuts, burns, blisters or skin infections) </li>
    <li>People who misuse drugs intravenously </li>
    <li>People with indwelling lines or catheters </li>
</ul>
<p>Take into account that women who are pregnant, have given birth or had a termination of pregnancy or miscarriage in the past 6 weeks are in a high risk group for sepsis. In particular, women who:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Have impaired immune systems because of illness or drugs (see "Identifying People with Suspected Sepsis," above) </li>
    <li>Have gestational diabetes or diabetes or other comorbidities </li>
    <li>Needed invasive procedures (for example, caesarean section, forceps delivery, removal of retained products of conception) </li>
    <li>Had prolonged rupture of membranes </li>
    <li>Have or have been in close contact with people with group A streptococcal infection, for example, scarlet fever </li>
    <li>Have continued vaginal bleeding or an offensive vaginal discharge </li>
</ul>
<p>Take into account the following risk factors for early-onset neonatal infection:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Invasive group B streptococcal infection in a previous baby </li>
    <li>Maternal group B streptococcal colonisation, bacteriuria or infection in the current pregnancy </li>
    <li>Prelabour rupture of membranes </li>
    <li>Preterm birth following spontaneous labour (before 37 weeks' gestation) </li>
    <li>Suspected or confirmed rupture of membranes for more than 18 hours in a preterm birth </li>
    <li>Intrapartum fever higher than 38&deg;C, or confirmed or suspected chorioamnionitis </li>
    <li>Parenteral antibiotic treatment given to the woman for confirmed or suspected invasive bacterial infection (such as septicaemia) at any time during labour, or in the 24-hour periods before and after the birth (this does not refer to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis) </li>
    <li>Suspected or confirmed infection in another baby in the case of a multiple pregnancy </li>
</ul>
<p>(This recommendation is from NICE's guideline on neonatal infection [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/38408/" title="Guideline #9307" target="_blank">Antibiotics for early-onset neonatal infection. Antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of early-onset neonatal infection</a>].)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Face-to-face Assessment of People with Suspected Sepsis</span></strong></p>
<p>Assess temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, level of consciousness and oxygen saturation in young people and adults with suspected sepsis.</p>
<p>Assess temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, level of consciousness, oxygen saturation and capillary refill time in children under 12 years with suspected sepsis. (This recommendation is adapted from NICE's guideline on fever in under 5s [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/46233/" title="Guideline #9891" target="_blank">Feverish illness in children: assessment and initial management in children younger than 5 years</a>].)</p>
<p>Measure blood pressure of children under 5 years if heart rate or capillary refill time is abnormal and facilities to measure blood pressure, including a correctly-sized blood pressure cuff, are available. (This recommendation is adapted from NICE's guideline on fever in under 5s [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/46233/" title="Guideline #9891" target="_blank">Feverish illness in children: assessment and initial management in children younger than 5 years</a>].)</p>
<p>Measure blood pressure of children aged 5 to 11 years who might have sepsis if facilities to measure blood pressure, including a correctly-sized cuff, are available.</p>
<p>Only measure blood pressure in children under 12 years in community settings if facilities to measure blood pressure, including a correctly-sized cuff, are available and taking a measurement does not cause a delay in assessment or treatment.</p>
<p>Measure oxygen saturation in community settings if equipment is available and taking a measurement does not cause a delay in assessment or treatment.</p>
<p>Examine people with suspected sepsis for mottled or ashen appearance, cyanosis of the skin, lips or tongue, non-blanching rash of the skin, any breach of skin integrity (for example, cuts, burns or skin infections) or other rash indicating potential infection.</p>
<p>Ask the person, parent or carer about frequency of urination in the past 18 hours.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stratifying Risk of Severe Illness or Death from Sepsis</span></strong></p>
<p>Use the person's history and physical examination results to grade risk of severe illness or death from sepsis using criteria based on age (see Tables 1, 2, and 3 in the original guideline document).</p>

<p>(This recommendation is adapted from NICE's guideline on fever in under 5s [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/46233/" title="Guideline #9891" target="_blank">Feverish illness in children: assessment and initial management in children younger than 5 years</a>].)</p>
<p>Consider children aged under 5 years with suspected sepsis who do not meet any high or moderate to high risk criteria to be at low risk of severe illness or death from sepsis. (This recommendation is adapted from NICE's guideline on fever in under 5s [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/46233/" title="Guideline #9891" target="_blank">Feverish illness in children: assessment and initial management in children younger than 5 years</a>].)</p>
<p><strong>Children, Young People and Adults with Suspected Sepsis</strong></p>
<p><em>Temperature in Suspected Sepsis</em></p>
<p>Do not use a person's temperature as the sole predictor of sepsis.</p>
<p>Do not rely on fever or hypothermia to rule sepsis either in or out.</p>
<p>Ask the person with suspected sepsis and their family or carers about any recent fever or rigors.</p>
<p>Take into account that some groups of people with sepsis may not develop a raised temperature. These include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>People who are older or very frail </li>
    <li>People having treatment for cancer </li>
    <li>People severely ill with sepsis </li>
    <li>Young infants or children </li>
</ul>
<p>Take into account that a rise in temperature can be a physiological response, for example after surgery or trauma.</p>
<p><em>Heart Rate in Suspected Sepsis</em></p>
<p>Interpret the heart rate of a person with suspected sepsis in context, taking into account that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Baseline heart rate may be lower in young people and adults who are fit </li>
    <li>Baseline heart rate in pregnancy is 10 to 15 beats per minute more than normal </li>
    <li>Older people with an infection may not develop an increased heart rate </li>
    <li>Older people may develop a new arrhythmia in response to infection rather than an increased heart rate </li>
    <li>Heart rate response may be affected by medicines such as beta-blockers </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Blood Pressure in Suspected Sepsis</em></p>
<p>Interpret blood pressure in the context of a person's previous blood pressure, if known. Be aware that the presence of normal blood pressure does not exclude sepsis in children and young people.</p>
<p><em>Confusion, Mental State and Cognitive State in Suspected Sepsis</em></p>
<p>Interpret a person's mental state in the context of their normal function and treat changes as being significant.</p>
<p>Be aware that changes in cognitive function may be subtle and assessment should include history from patient and family or carers.</p>
<p>Take into account that changes in cognitive function may present as changes in behaviour or irritability in both children and in adults with dementia.</p>
<p>Take into account that changes in cognitive function in older people may present as acute changes in functional abilities.</p>
<p><em>Oxygen Saturation in Suspected Sepsis</em></p>
<p>Take into account that if peripheral oxygen saturation is difficult to measure in a person with suspected sepsis, this may indicate poor peripheral circulation because of shock.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Managing Suspected Sepsis Outside Acute Hospital Settings</span></strong></p>
<p>Refer all people with suspected sepsis outside acute hospital settings for emergency medical care<sup>1</sup> by the most appropriate means of transport (usually 999 ambulance) if:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>They meet any high risk criteria (see Tables 1, 2, and 3 in the original guideline document) or </li>
    <li>They are aged under 17 years and their immunity is impaired by drugs or illness and they have any moderate to high risk criteria </li>
</ul>
<p>Assess all people with suspected sepsis outside acute hospital settings with any moderate to high risk criteria to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Make a definitive diagnosis of their condition </li>
    <li>Decide whether they can be treated safely outside hospital </li>
</ul>
<p>If a definitive diagnosis is not reached or the person cannot be treated safely outside an acute hospital setting, refer them urgently for emergency care.</p>
<p>Provide people with suspected sepsis, who do not have any high or moderate to high risk criteria information about symptoms to monitor and how to access medical care if they are concerned.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Managing and Treating Suspected Sepsis in Acute Hospital Settings</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Adults, Children and Young People Aged 12 Years and Over with Suspected Sepsis Who Meet 1 or More High Risk Criteria</strong></p>
<p>For adults, children and young people aged 12 years and over who have suspected sepsis and 1 or more high risk criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Arrange for immediate review by the senior clinical decision maker<sup>2</sup> to assess the person and think about alternative diagnoses to sepsis </li>
    <li>Carry out a venous blood test for the following:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Blood gas, including glucose and lactate measurement </li>
        <li>Blood culture </li>
        <li>Full blood count </li>
        <li>C-reactive protein </li>
        <li>Urea and electrolytes </li>
        <li>Creatinine </li>
        <li>A clotting screen </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Give a broad-spectrum antimicrobial at the maximum recommended dose without delay (within 1 hour of identifying that they meet any high risk criteria in an acute hospital setting) in line with recommendations in the "Antibiotic Treatment in People with Suspected Sepsis" section below. </li>

(This recommendation is from NICE's guideline on intravenous fluid therapy in adults in hospital [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/47754/" title="Guideline #10195" target="_blank">Intravenous fluid therapy in adults in hospital</a>].)</p>
    <p>If children and young people up to 16 years need intravenous fluid resuscitation, use glucose-free crystalloids that contain sodium in the range 130&ndash;154 mmol/litre, with a bolus of 20 ml/kg over less than 10 minutes. Take into account preexisting conditions (for example, cardiac disease or kidney disease), because smaller fluid volumes may be needed. (This recommendation is from NICE's guideline on intravenous fluid therapy in children and young people in hospital [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/49955/" title="Guideline #10872" target="_blank">Intravenous fluid therapy in children and young people in hospital</a>].)</p>
    <p>If neonates need intravenous fluid resuscitation, use glucose-free crystalloids that contain sodium in the range 130&ndash;154 mmol/litre, with a bolus of 10&ndash;20 ml/kg over less than 10 minutes. (This recommendation is from NICE's guideline on intravenous fluid therapy in children and young people in hospital [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/49955/" title="Guideline #10872" target="_blank">Intravenous fluid therapy in children and young people in hospital</a>].)</p>
    <p>Reassess the patient after completion of the intravenous fluid bolus, and if no improvement give a second bolus. If there is no improvement after a second bolus alert a consultant to attend (in line with recommendations under "Managing and Treating Suspected Sepsis in Acute Hospital Settings," above).</p>
    <p>Use a pump, or syringe if no pump is available, to deliver intravenous fluids for resuscitation to children under 12 years with suspected sepsis who need fluids in bolus form.</p>
    <p>If using a pump or flow controller to deliver intravenous fluids for resuscitation to people over 12 years with suspected sepsis who need fluids in bolus form ensure device is capable of delivering fluid at required rate, for example at least 2000 ml/hour in adults.</p>
    <p>Do not use starch based solutions or hydroxyethyl starches for fluid resuscitation for people with sepsis. (This recommendation is adapted from NICE's guidelines on intravenous fluid therapy in adults in hospital and intravenous therapy in children and young people in hospital [see the NGC summaries of the NICE guidelines <a href="/summaries/summary/47754/" title="Guideline #10195" target="_blank">Intravenous fluid therapy in adults in hospital</a> and <a href="/summaries/summary/49955/" title="Guideline #10872" target="_blank">Intravenous fluid therapy in children and young people in hospital</a>].)</p>
    <p>Consider human albumin solution 4% to 5% for fluid resuscitation only in patients with sepsis and shock. (This recommendation is adapted from NICE's guideline on intravenous fluid therapy in adults in hospital [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/47754/" title="Guideline #10195" target="_blank">Intravenous fluid therapy in adults in hospital</a>].)</p>
    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using Oxygen in People with Suspected Sepsis</span></strong></p>
    <p>Give oxygen to achieve a target saturation of 94% to 98% for adult patients or 88% to 92% for those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure.</p>
    <p>Oxygen should be given to children with suspected sepsis who have signs of shock or oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of less than 91% when breathing air. Treatment with oxygen should also be considered for children with an SpO<sub>2</sub> of greater than 92%, as clinically indicated. (This recommendation is adapted from NICE's guideline on fever in under 5s [see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/46233/" title="Guideline #9891" target="_blank">Feverish illness in children: assessment and initial management in children younger than 5 years</a>].)</p>
    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finding the Source of Infection in People with Suspected Sepsis</span></strong></p>
    <p>Carry out a thorough clinical examination to look for sources of infection, including sources that might need surgical drainage, as part of the initial assessment.</p>
    <p>Tailor investigations of the sources of infection to the person's clinical history and findings on examination.</p>
    <p>Consider urine analysis and chest X-ray to identify the source of infection in all people with suspected sepsis.</p>
    <p>Consider imaging of the abdomen and pelvis if no likely source of infection is identified after clinical examination and initial tests.</p>
    <p>Involve the adult or paediatric surgical and gynaecological teams early on if intra-abdominal or pelvic infection is suspected in case surgical treatment is needed.</p>
    <p>Do not perform a lumbar puncture without consultant instruction if any of the following contraindications are present:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Signs suggesting raised intracranial pressure or reduced or fluctuating level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 9 or a drop of 3 points or more) </li>

        <li>Possible short-term and long-term problems </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Give people who have had sepsis and their families and carers information about national charities and support groups that provide information about sepsis and causes of sepsis.</p>
    <p>Advise carers they have a legal right to have a carer's assessment of their needs, and give them information on how they can get this.</p>

    <p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
    <p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
    <p><em>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</em></p>
    <p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
    <p><em>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</em></p>
    <p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
    <p><em>Interventions That Could Be Used</em></p>
    <p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The guideline was developed by the National Guideline Centre on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance and related appendices.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Developing the Review Questions and Outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Review questions were developed in a PICO framework (patient, intervention, comparison and outcome) for intervention reviews; in a framework of population, index tests, reference standard and target condition for reviews of diagnostic test accuracy; and using population, presence or absence of factors under investigation (for example, prognostic factors) and outcomes for prognostic reviews.</p>
<p>This use of a framework guided the literature searching process, critical appraisal and synthesis of evidence, and facilitated the development of recommendations by the Guideline Development Group (GDG). The review questions were drafted by the NGC technical team and refined and validated by the GDG. The questions were based on the key clinical areas identified in the scope (see Appendix A).</p>
<p>A total of 18 review questions were identified.</p>
<p>Full literature searches, critical appraisals and evidence reviews were completed for all the specified review questions, except for source of infection, early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) and central venous (CV) access. The recommendations for source of infection and CV access are based on discussions, consensus and expert opinion of the GDG and were also informed by other review questions. The rationale for these decisions is explained in more detail in relevant chapters of the full version of the guideline. The review on EGDT only includes a recent systematic review on three large multi-centre randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the ProMISe, ARISE, and ProCESS trials. This systematic review was considered to adequately address the EDGT review question.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Searching for Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>Systematic literature searches were undertaken to identify all published clinical evidence relevant to the review questions. Searches were undertaken according to the parameters stipulated within the NICE guidelines (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Databases were searched using relevant medical subject headings, free-text terms and study-type filters where appropriate. Studies published in languages other than English were not reviewed. Where possible, searches were restricted to articles published in English. All searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library. Additional subject specific databases were used for one question: CINAHL and PsycINFO for information support. All searches were updated on 9 October 2015. No papers added to the databases after this date were considered.</p>
<p>Search strategies were quality assured by cross-checking reference lists of highly relevant papers, analysing search strategies in other systematic reviews, and asking GDG members to highlight any additional studies. The questions, the study types applied, the databases searched and the years covered can be found in Appendix G of the full version of the guideline.</p>
<p>The titles and abstracts of records retrieved by the searches were sifted for relevance, with potentially significant publications obtained in full text. These were assessed against the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>During the scoping stage, a search was conducted for guidelines and reports on the Web sites listed below from organisations relevant to the topic. Searching for unpublished literature was not undertaken. All references sent by stakeholders were considered.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Health Economic Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>Systematic literature searches were also undertaken to identify health economic evidence within published literature relevant to the review questions. The evidence was identified by conducting a broad search relating to sepsis and bacterial meningitis populations in the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), the Health Technology Assessment database (HTA) and the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) with no date restrictions. The Health Economic Evaluation Database ceased production in 2014 with access ceasing in January 2015. Additionally, the search was run on MEDLINE and EMBASE using a specific economic filter, from 2012, to ensure recent publications that had not yet been indexed by the economic databases were identified. Studies published in languages other than English were not reviewed. Where possible, searches were restricted to articles published in English.</p>
<p>The health economic search strategies are included in Appendix G. All searches were updated on 9 October 2015. No papers added to the databases after this date were considered.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence of Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence was reviewed following the steps shown schematically in Figure 1 in the full version of the guideline document:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Potentially relevant studies were identified for each review question from the relevant search results by reviewing titles and abstracts. Full papers were then obtained. </li>
    <li>Full papers were reviewed against pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify studies that addressed the review question in the appropriate population (review protocols are included in Appendix C of the full version of the guideline). </li>
</ul>
<p>A 20% sample of each of the stages of the reviewing process was quality assured by a second reviewer to eliminate any potential of reviewer bias or error.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion of studies was based on the review protocols, which can be found in Appendix C. Excluded studies by review question (with the reasons for their exclusion) are listed in Appendix L. The GDG was consulted about any uncertainty regarding inclusion or exclusion.</p>
<p>The guideline population was defined to be adults, children (including neonates) and young people at risk of developing sepsis. For some review questions, the review population also included people with definite sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. The review on information and support also included families and carers of people who had sepsis or severe sepsis, and people who had survived episodes of severe sepsis. For the review on education and training, the review population was defined as all healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis, management and monitoring of sepsis.</p>
<p>The subgroups considered included children, adults, pregnant women, people at higher risk of infection, and different settings of care delivery. For some review questions, the evidence was grouped by predefined subgroup analysis based on severity of illness.</p>
<p>Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, and observational studies (including diagnostic or prognostic studies) were included in the evidence reviews as appropriate.</p>
<p>Literature reviews, posters, letters, editorials, comment articles, unpublished studies and studies not in English were excluded. The review protocols are presented in Appendix C.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence of Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>The GDG is required to make decisions based on the best available evidence of both clinical and cost-effectiveness. Guideline recommendations should be based on the expected costs of the different options in relation to their expected health benefits (that is, their "cost effectiveness") rather than the total implementation cost. Thus, if the evidence suggests that a strategy provides significant health benefits at an acceptable cost per patient treated, it should be recommended even if it would be expensive to implement across the whole population.</p>
<p>Evidence on cost-effectiveness related to the key clinical issues being addressed in the guideline was sought. The health economist:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Undertook a systematic review of the published economic literature. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>The health economist:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Identified potentially relevant studies for each review question from the economic search results by reviewing titles and abstracts. Full papers were then obtained. </li>
    <li>Reviewed full papers against pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify relevant studies (see below for details). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</em></p>
<p>Full economic evaluations (studies comparing costs and health consequences of alternative courses of action: cost&ndash;utility, cost-effectiveness, cost&ndash;benefit and cost&ndash;consequences analyses) and comparative costing studies that addressed the review question in the relevant population were considered potentially includable as economic evidence.</p>
<p>Studies that only reported cost per hospital (not per patient), or only reported average cost-effectiveness without disaggregated costs and effects, were excluded. Literature reviews, abstracts, posters, letters, editorials, comment articles, unpublished studies and studies not in English were excluded. Studies published before 1999 and studies from non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries or the USA were also excluded, on the basis that the applicability of such studies to the present UK NHS context is likely to be too low for them to be helpful for decision-making.</p>
<p>Remaining studies were prioritised for inclusion based on their relative applicability to the development of this guideline and the study limitations. For example, if a high quality, directly applicable UK analysis was available, then other less relevant studies may not have been included. Where exclusions occurred on this basis, this is noted in the relevant section in the full version of the guideline.</p>
<p>For more details about the assessment of applicability and methodological quality see Table 7 in the full version of the guideline and the economic evaluation checklist (Appendix G of the NICE guidelines manual 2012) and the health economics review protocol in Appendix C.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The guideline was developed by the National Guideline Centre on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance and related appendices.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence of Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence was reviewed following the steps shown schematically in Figure 1 of the full version of the guideline:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Relevant studies were critically appraised using the appropriate checklist as specified in the NICE guidelines manual (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </li>
    <li>Key information was extracted on the study's methods, PICO (patient, intervention, comparison and outcome) factors and results. These were presented in summary tables (in each review chapter of the full version of the guideline) and evidence tables (in Appendix H). </li>
    <li>Summaries of evidence were generated by outcome (included in the relevant review chapters) and were presented in Guideline Development Group (GDG) meetings:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Randomised studies: data were meta-analysed where appropriate and reported in Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) profiles (for intervention reviews) </li>
        <li>Observational studies: data were presented as a range of values in GRADE profiles. </li>
        <li>Prognostic studies: data were presented as a range of values, usually in terms of the relative effect as reported by the authors </li>
        <li>Diagnostic studies: for reviews of diagnostic tests, diagnostic randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were the first line approach and, as with intervention reviews, evidence summaries were generated. If no evidence was found from diagnostic RCTs, diagnostic accuracy studies were reviewed. Coupled sensitivity and specificity values were summarised in forest plots. Accuracy measures were meta-analysed and reported as pooled results where appropriate. Where meta-analysis was performed, coupled sensitivity and specificity values were also presented on summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) plots along with the results of the meta-analysis (the summary sensitivity and specificity point and 95% confidence region) and the summary curve. Where evidence was not meta-analysed, because studies differed in population or outcome, then no alternative pooling strategies were carried out, on the basis that such pooling would have little meaning. Results from single studies were presented. </li>
        <li>Qualitative studies: each study was summarised in a table where possible, otherwise presented in a narrative. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A 20% sample of each of the above stages of the reviewing process was quality assured by a second reviewer to eliminate any potential of reviewer bias or error.</p>
<p><strong>Methods of Combining Clinical Studies</strong></p>
<p><em>Data Synthesis for Intervention Reviews</em></p>
<p>Where possible, meta-analyses were conducted to combine the results of studies for each review question using Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan5) software. Fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) techniques were used to calculate risk ratios (relative risk) for the binary outcomes, such as mortality, critical care admission and adverse events.</p>
<p>For continuous outcomes, measures of central tendency (mean) and variation (standard deviation) were required for meta-analysis. Data for continuous outcomes, such as health-related quality of life, length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital, and the number of organs supported, were analysed using an inverse variance method for pooling weighted mean differences and, where the studies had different scales, standardised mean differences were used. A generic inverse variance option in RevMan5 was used if any studies reported solely the summary statistics and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) or standard error; this included any hazard ratios reported. However, in cases where standard deviations were not reported per intervention group, the standard error (SE) for the mean difference was calculated from other reported statistics (p values or 95% CIs); meta-analysis was then undertaken for the mean difference and SE using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan5. When the only evidence was based on studies that summarised results by presenting medians (and interquartile ranges), or only p values were given, this information was assessed in terms of the study's sample size and was included in the GRADE tables without calculating the relative or absolute effects. Consequently, aspects of quality assessment such as imprecision of effect could not be assessed for evidence of this type.</p>
<p><em>Data Synthesis for Prognostic Factor Reviews</em></p>
<p>A variety of prognostic effect measures were extracted from papers, depending on the type of outcome.</p>
<p>For binary outcomes, odds ratios, risk ratios or hazard ratios (with their 95% CIs) for the independent effect of each prognostic factor on the outcome were extracted. Beta coefficients for dichotomous outcomes were normally converted to an odds ratio (OR) by taking the anti-natural logarithm of the beta coefficient (as Beta coefficient = ln OR).</p>
<p>For continuous outcomes, the Beta coefficients (or standardised beta coefficients) with their 95% CIs for the independent effect of each prognostic factor were extracted.</p>
<p>RCTs, pooled analyses of patient level data, and prospective or retrospective cohort studies were included. Case-control studies were excluded because of their high risk of recall bias. All non-RCT studies were required to have considered <strong>all</strong> key confounders previously identified by the GDG at the protocol stage for that outcome. Studies not considering these key confounders were excluded. For a confounder to be regarded as having been adequately considered, it would have to have been included in the multivariable analysis (although in a step-wise model it would not necessarily have to be present in the final model) or would have to have been shown to be matched across risk factor or outcome groups at baseline.</p>
<p><em>Data Synthesis for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews</em></p>
<p>For the reviews of diagnostic accuracy, the following measures were used:</p>
<p><em>The coupled sensitivity and specificity values at a given threshold</em>: Coupled forest plots of sensitivity and specificity with their 95% CIs across studies were produced for each test (and for each clinically relevant threshold), using RevMan5. In order to do this, 2&times;2 tables (the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives) were directly taken from the study where possible, or else were derived from raw data or calculated from the set of test accuracy statistics.</p>
<p>Data were meta-analysed when data were available from 3 or more studies (given data were reported at the same threshold or within a defined range of similar thresholds). To do this, data were entered into a bivariate model using WinBUGS. If the model did not converge due to heterogeneity, the pooled estimate was not presented. A diagnostic meta-analysis was not conducted because the included population and the patient outcomes in the included studies were too different from each other. Where meta-analysis was performed, in addition to the forest plots, the coupled sensitivity and specificity values were also presented on summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) plots for visual information along with the results of the meta-analysis (the summary sensitivity and specificity point and 95% confidence region) and the summary curve. To do this, bivariate WinBUGS model outputs were entered into RevMan5.</p>
<p>Pooled sensitivity and specificity values were reported in the clinical evidence profile tables (or, if meta-analysis was not performed, results from single studies were presented). For comparison of multiple index tests (or between different thresholds for the same test), the sensitivity and specificity values were compared between tests.</p>
<p><em>Data Synthesis for Qualitative Study Reviews</em></p>
<p>Where possible a meta-synthesis was conducted to combine qualitative study results. This guideline includes two qualitative review questions; one on information, education and support considered to be useful by people who are at risk of developing sepsis, have sepsis or have survived episodes of sepsis, and one on the availability of education training programmes for healthcare professionals to recognise, diagnose and manage sepsis. Whenever studies identified a qualitative theme, this was extracted and the main characteristics were summarised. When all themes were extracted from studies, common concepts were categorised and tabulated. This included information on how many studies had identified this theme. A frequently identified theme may indicate an important issue for the review, but frequency of theme is not the only indicator of importance. Study type and population in qualitative research can differ widely meaning that themes that may only be identified by one or a few studies can provide important new information. Therefore for the purpose of the qualitative review in this guideline the categorisation of themes was exhaustive, that is all themes were accounted for in the synthesis. The GDG could then draw conclusions on the relative merits of each of the themes and how they may help in forming recommendations.</p>
<p>See Section 4.3.2 in the full version of the guideline document for additional information on data synthesis for different types of studies.</p>
<p><strong>Appraising the Quality of Evidence by Outcomes</strong></p>
<p><em>Interventional Studies</em></p>
<p>The evidence for outcomes from the included RCTs and, where appropriate, observational studies were evaluated and presented using an adaptation of the 'GRADE toolbox' developed by the international GRADE working group (<a href="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org" title="GRADE Web site">www.gradeworkinggroup.org</a>). The software developed by the GRADE working group (GRADEpro) was used to assess the quality of each outcome, taking into account individual study quality factors and the meta-analysis results. Results were presented in GRADE profiles 'GRADE tables'), which consist of 2 sections: the 'Clinical evidence profile' table includes details of the quality assessment while the 'Clinical evidence summary of findings' table includes pooled outcome data, where appropriate, an absolute measure of intervention effect and the summary of quality of evidence for that outcome. In this table, the columns for intervention and control indicate summary measures and measures of dispersion (such as mean and standard deviation or median and range) for continuous outcomes and frequency of events (n/N: the sum across studies of the number of patients with events divided by sum of the number of completers) for binary outcomes. Reporting or publication bias was only taken into consideration in the quality assessment and included in the 'Clinical evidence profile' table if it was apparent.</p>
<p>The evidence for each outcome was examined separately for the quality elements listed and defined in Table 2 of the full version of the guideline. Each element was graded using the quality levels listed in Table 3 of the full version of the guideline. The main criteria considered in the rating of these elements are discussed below. Footnotes were used to describe reasons for grading a quality element as having serious or very serious problems. The ratings for each component were summed to obtain an overall assessment for each outcome (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>
<p>The GRADE toolbox is currently designed only for randomised trials and observational studies but the quality assessment elements and outcome presentation were adapted for diagnostic accuracy studies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grading the Quality of Clinical Evidence</span></p>
<p>After results were pooled, the overall quality of evidence for each outcome was considered. The following procedure was adopted when using GRADE:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A quality rating was assigned, based on the study design. RCTs started as High, observational studies as Low, and uncontrolled case series as Low or Very low. </li>
    <li>The rating was then downgraded for the specified criteria: risk of bias (study limitations), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. These criteria are detailed in the full version of the guideline. Evidence from observational studies (which had not previously been downgraded) was upgraded if there was: a large magnitude of effect, a dose&ndash;response gradient, and if all plausible confounding would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results showed no effect. Each quality element considered to have 'serious' or 'very serious' risk of bias was rated down by 1 or 2 points respectively. </li>
    <li>The downgraded or upgraded marks were then summed and the overall quality rating was revised. For example, all RCTs started as High and the overall quality became Moderate, Low or Very low if 1, 2 or 3 points were deducted respectively. </li>
    <li>The reasons or criteria used for downgrading were specified in the footnotes. </li>
</ol>
<p>The details of the criteria used for each of the main quality elements for all types of studies are discussed further in Sections 4.3.4.1.1 to 4.3.4.1.4 of the full version of the guideline. Refer to Sections 4.3.4.2 and 4.3.4.3 for information on diagnostic and prognostic studies, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing Clinical Importance</strong></p>
<p>The GDG assessed the evidence by outcome in order to determine if there was, or potentially was, a clinically important benefit, a clinically important harm or no clinically important difference between interventions. To facilitate this, binary outcomes were converted into absolute risk differences (ARDs) using GRADEpro software: the median control group risk across studies was used to calculate the ARD and its 95% CI from the pooled risk ratio.</p>
<p>The assessment of benefit, harm, or no benefit or harm was based on the point estimate of absolute effect for intervention studies which was standardised across the reviews. The GDG considered for most of the outcomes in the intervention reviews that if at least 100 participants per 1000 (10%) achieved (if positive) the outcome of interest in the intervention group compared to the comparison group then this intervention would be considered beneficial. The same point estimate but in the opposite direction would apply if the outcome was negative.</p>
<p>This assessment was carried out by the GDG for each critical outcome, and an evidence summary table was produced to compile the GDG's assessments of clinical importance per outcome, alongside the evidence quality and the uncertainty in the effect estimate (imprecision).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Statements</strong></p>
<p>Evidence statements are summary statements that are presented after the GRADE profiles, summarising the key features of the clinical effectiveness evidence presented. The wording of the evidence statements reflects the certainty or uncertainty in the estimate of effect. The evidence statements encompass the following key features of the evidence:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>An indication of the direction of effect (if one treatment is beneficial or harmful compared to the other, or whether there is no difference between the 2 tested treatments) </li>
    <li>A description of the overall quality of evidence </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence of Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>The GDG is required to make decisions based on the best available evidence of both clinical and cost-effectiveness. Guideline recommendations should be based on the expected costs of the different options in relation to their expected health benefits (that is, their "cost effectiveness") rather than the total implementation cost. Thus, if the evidence suggests that a strategy provides significant health benefits at an acceptable cost per patient treated, it should be recommended even if it would be expensive to implement across the whole population.</p>
<p>Evidence on cost-effectiveness related to the key clinical issues being addressed in the guideline was sought. The health economist:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Undertook a systematic review of the published economic literature. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>The health economist:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Critically appraised relevant studies using the economic evaluations checklist as specified in the NICE guidelines manual </li>
    <li>Extracted key information about the studies' methods and results into evidence tables (included in Appendix I) </li>
    <li>Generated summaries of the evidence in NICE economic evidence profiles (included in the relevant chapter for each review question) &ndash; see below for details. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NICE Economic Evidence Profiles</strong></p>
<p>The NICE economic evidence profile has been used to summarise cost and cost-effectiveness estimates. The economic evidence profile shows an assessment of applicability and methodological quality for each economic evaluation, with footnotes indicating the reasons for the assessment. These assessments were made by the health economist using the economic evaluation checklist from the NICE guidelines manual. It also shows the incremental costs, incremental effects (for example, quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the base case analysis in the evaluation, as well as information about the assessment of uncertainty in the analysis. See Table 7 of the full version of the guideline for more details.</p>
<p>If a non-UK study was included in the profile, the results were converted into pounds sterling using the appropriate purchasing power parity.</p>
<p><strong>Undertaking New Health Economic Analysis</strong></p>
<p>No new health economic analysis was undertaken for this guideline due to feasibility.</p>
<p>The GDG originally identified the timing of antimicrobial treatment as the highest priority area for original economic modelling. This question was originally intended to determine the cost-effectiveness of early empirical antibiotic use compared to the use of targeted antibiotics following diagnosis. This question changed following agreement of the protocol and examined the timing of empirical antibiotics. The clinical evidence for this question indicates that early empirical antimicrobials (given &lt;1 hour) result in lower mortality than delayed use. The GDG were confident that any resource implications, and therefore costs, would be offset by the benefits in terms of reduced mortality. As a result the GDG agreed that the cost-effectiveness could be deduced without the need to model. Thus, this area was no longer a priority of economic modelling.</p>
<p>An additional lower priority of a pathway approach (the impact of identifying and treating people with sepsis) was also considered. However a pathway approach was considered unfeasible due to the large number of unknowns in the epidemiology of sepsis.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness Criteria</strong></p>
<p>NICE's report 'Social value judgements: principles for the development of NICE guidance' sets out the principles that GDGs should consider when judging whether an intervention offers good value for money. In general, an intervention was considered to be cost effective if either of the following criteria applied (given that the estimate was considered plausible):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The intervention dominated other relevant strategies (that is, it was both less costly in terms of resource use and more clinically effective compared with all the other relevant alternative strategies), or </li>
    <li>The intervention costs less than &pound;20,000 per QALY gained compared with the next best strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>If the GDG recommended an intervention that was estimated to cost more than &pound;20,000 per QALY gained, or did not recommend one that was estimated to cost less than &pound;20,000 per QALY gained, the reasons for this decision are discussed explicitly in the 'Recommendations and link to evidence&rsquo; section of the relevant chapter, with reference to issues regarding the plausibility of the estimate or to the factors set out in 'Social value judgements: principles for the development of NICE guidance'.</p>
<p>If a study reported the cost per life year gained but not QALYs, the cost per QALY gained was estimated by multiplying by an appropriate utility estimate to aid interpretation. The estimated cost per QALY gained is reported in the economic evidence profile with a footnote detailing the life-years gained and the utility value used. When QALYs or life years gained are not used in the analysis, results are difficult to interpret unless one strategy dominates the others with respect to every relevant health outcome and cost.</p>
<p><strong>In the Absence of Economic Evidence</strong></p>
<p>When no relevant published studies were found, and a new analysis was not prioritised, the GDG made a qualitative judgement about cost-effectiveness by considering expected differences in resource use between options and relevant UK National Health Service (NHS) unit costs, alongside the results of the clinical review of effectiveness evidence.</p>
<p>The UK NHS costs reported in the guideline are those that were presented to the GDG and were correct at the time recommendations were drafted. They may have changed subsequently before the time of publication. However, the GDG members have no reason to believe they have changed substantially.</p></div>

See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance and related appendices.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who Developed This Guideline?</span></strong></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising health professionals, lay members and researchers developed this guideline.</p>
<p>The group met approximately every 6 weeks during the development of the guideline.</p>
<p>Staff from the National Guideline Centre provided methodological support and guidance for the development process. The team working on the guideline included a project manager, document editor, systematic reviewers (research fellows), health economists and information scientists. They undertook systematic searches of the literature, appraised the evidence, conducted meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate, and drafted the guideline in collaboration with the GDG.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Developing Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Over the course of the guideline development process, the GDG was presented with:</p>

<p>Recommendations were drafted on the basis of the GDG's interpretation of the available evidence, taking into account the balance of benefits, harms and costs between different courses of action. This was either done formally in an economic model, or informally. Firstly, the net benefit over harm (clinical effectiveness) was considered, focusing on the critical outcomes. When this was done informally, the GDG took into account the clinical benefits and harms when one intervention was compared with another. The assessment of net benefit was moderated by the importance placed on the outcomes (the GDG's values and preferences), and the confidence the GDG had in the evidence (evidence quality). Secondly, whether the net benefit justified any differences in costs was assessed.</p>
<p>When clinical and economic evidence was of poor quality, conflicting or absent, the GDG drafted recommendations based on their expert opinion. The considerations for making consensus-based recommendations include the balance between potential harms and benefits, the economic costs compared to the economic benefits, current practices, recommendations made in other relevant guidelines, patient preferences and equality issues. The consensus recommendations were agreed through discussions in the GDG. The GDG also considered whether the uncertainty was sufficient to justify delaying making a recommendation to await further research, taking into account the potential harm of failing to make a clear recommendation.</p>
<p>The GDG considered the 'strength' of recommendations. This takes into account the quality of the evidence but is conceptually different. Some recommendations are 'strong' in that the GDG believes that the vast majority of healthcare and other professionals and patients would choose a particular intervention if they considered the evidence in the same way that the GDG has. This is generally the case if the benefits clearly outweigh the harms for most people and the intervention is likely to be cost effective. However, there is often a closer balance between benefits and harms, and some patients would not choose an intervention whereas others would. This may happen, for example, if some patients are particularly averse to some side effect and others are not. In these circumstances the recommendation is generally weaker, although it may be possible to make stronger recommendations about specific groups of patients.</p>
<p>The GDG focused on the following factors in agreeing the wording of the recommendations:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The actions health professionals need to take </li>
    <li>The information readers need to know </li>
    <li>The strength of the recommendation (for example the word 'offer' was used for strong recommendations and 'consider' for weak recommendations) </li>
    <li>The involvement of patients (and their carers if needed) in decisions on treatment and care </li>
    <li>Consistency with NICE's standard advice on recommendations about drugs, waiting times and ineffective interventions (see Section 9.3 in the NICE guidelines manual [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) </li>
</ul>
<p>The main considerations specific to each recommendation are outlined in the 'Recommendations and link to evidence' sections within each chapter of the full version of the guideline.</p></div>

<h3>
Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most people would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of people, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. The GDG uses similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&hellip;') when they are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most people.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most people, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the person's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the person.</p></div>

Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

<div class="content_para"><p>The type of evidence supporting the recommendations is not specifically stated.</p>
<p>Refer to "Evidence statements" sections in the full version of the guideline for discussion of the evidence supporting each recommendation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Type of Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>For most intervention reviews in this guideline, parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included because they are considered the most robust type of study design that could produce an unbiased estimate of the intervention effects. If the Guideline Development Group (GDG) believed RCT data were not appropriate or there was limited evidence from RCTs, well-conducted non-randomised studies were included. Please refer to Appendix C in the full guideline appendices (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for full details on the study design of studies selected for each review question. For example, the review question on escalation of care did not include any RCTs as randomly assigning people with sepsis to either be referred to a senior healthcare professional or remain under the care of staff with less experience would be highly unethical. The same applies to the review question on timing of antimicrobial treatment: randomly assigning people with sepsis to a delayed intervention would be unethical. The reviews on inotropic agents or vasopressors also included observational studies as the GDG agreed that the evidence presented by those studies could help inform recommendations.</p>
<p>For reviews of diagnostic tests, diagnostic RCTs were considered the first line approach, in which patients are randomised to one diagnostic test or another followed by treatment, and patient outcomes are assessed. If no evidence was identified from diagnostic RCTs, diagnostic accuracy was reviewed using prospective and retrospective cohort studies in which the index test(s) and the reference standard test are applied to the same patients in a cross-sectional design. Two-gate study designs (sometimes referred to as case-control) were excluded. These are cross-sectional studies which compare the results of the index test in patients with an already established diagnosis of the target condition, with healthy controls. This study design is unrepresentative of practice and is unlikely to contain the full spectrum of health and disease over which the test would be used. Studies of this design may lead to the selective inclusion of cases with more advanced disease and over estimations of sensitivity. The inclusion of healthy controls is likely to lead to over-estimations of specificity.</p>
<p>For prognostic reviews, RCTs, pooled analysis of patient level data, and retrospective cohort or prospective cohort studies were included. Case-control studies were excluded because of their high risk of recall bias.</p>
<p>Where data from observational studies were included, the GDG decided that the results for each outcome should be presented separately for each study and meta-analysis was not conducted.</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The main harm that may come to patients is both lack of identification of suspected sepsis and over diagnosis of suspected sepsis. The first group of patients may not get appropriate treatment. The latter group will be subject to investigations and treatments they might not need, including the use of broad spectrum antimicrobials increasing the risk of antimicrobial resistance at personal or population level if large numbers are over treated in this way. </li>
    <li>The likely benefit of acute hospital care outweighs any potential harm from transfer to hospital. Inappropriate referral to acute hospital services for people at low risk and who can be managed in the community may lead to iatrogenic harm. </li>
    <li>People with sepsis can be difficult to identify. Simple blood tests that would identify people with sepsis and/or people at risk of poor outcomes would be helpful in identifying those who require interventions rapidly. A test which performs poorly will give false reassurance and be of potential harm. The evidence indicated that commonly available blood tests had poor performance overall for diagnosis. </li>
    <li>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) agreed that a dose of empiric antibiotic is unlikely to cause harm to an individual patient except where a patient has an allergy which is severe enough to cause an anaphylactic reaction. </li>
    <li>Oxygen treatment is known not to improve subjective feelings of breathlessness and can be harmful if people are at risk of hypercapnia such as people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as it may precipitate respiratory failure. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or service users. The application of the recommendations in this guideline are not mandatory and the guideline does not override the responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or their carer or guardian. </li>
    <li>Local commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual health professionals and their patients or service users wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>
    <li>At the time of writing, the terminology around sepsis is changing and new international consensus definitions have been published. Previous terminology included terms SIRS (systematic inflammatory response syndrome), severe sepsis and septic shock but new terminology suggests using terms sepsis and septic shock only. </li>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Putting This Guideline into Practice</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng51/resources" title="NICE Web site">tools and resources</a> to help put this guideline into practice.</p>
<p>Putting recommendations into practice can take time. How long may vary from guideline to guideline, and depends on how much change in practice or services is needed. Implementing change is most effective when aligned with local priorities.</p>
<p>Changes recommended for clinical practice that can be done quickly &ndash; like changes in prescribing practice &ndash; should be shared quickly. This is because health professionals should use guidelines to guide their work &ndash; as is required by professional regulating bodies such as the General Medical and Nursing and Midwifery Councils.</p>
<p>Changes should be implemented as soon as possible, unless there is a good reason for not doing so (for example, if it would be better value for money if a package of recommendations were all implemented at once).</p>
<p>Different organisations may need different approaches to implementation, depending upon their size and function. Sometimes individual practitioners may be able to respond to recommendations to improve their practice more quickly than large organisations.</p>
<p>Here are some pointers to help organisations put NICE guidelines into practice:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Raise awareness</strong> through routine communication channels, such as email or newsletters, regular meetings, internal staff briefings and other communications with all relevant partner organisations. Identify things staff can include in their own practice straight away. </li>
    <li><strong>Identify a lead</strong> with an interest in the topic to champion the guideline and motivate others to support its use and make service changes, and to find out any significant issues locally. </li>
    <li><strong>Carry out a baseline assessment</strong> against the recommendations to find out whether there are gaps in current service provision. </li>
    <li><strong>Think about what data you need to measure improvement</strong> and plan how you will collect it. You may want to work with other health and social care organisations and specialist groups to compare current practice with the recommendations. This may also help identify local issues that will slow or prevent implementation. </li>
    <li><strong>Develop an action plan</strong>, with the steps needed to put the guideline into practice, and make sure it is ready as soon as possible. Big, complex changes may take longer to implement, but some may be quick and easy to do. An action plan will help in both cases. </li>
    <li><strong>For very big changes</strong> include milestones and a business case, which will set out additional costs, savings and possible areas for disinvestment. A small project group could develop the action plan. The group might include the guideline champion, a senior organisational sponsor, staff involved in the associated services, finance and information professionals. </li>
    <li><strong>Implement the action plan</strong> with oversight from the lead and the project group. Big projects may also need project management support. </li>
    <li><strong>Review and monitor</strong> how well the guideline is being implemented through the project group. Share progress with those involved in making improvements, as well as relevant boards and local partners. </li>
</ol>
