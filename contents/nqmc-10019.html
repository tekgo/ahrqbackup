<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>People with diabetes rarely have their feet examined on a regular basis. Despite efforts with quality measures, performance improvement programs, etc., the occurrence of yearly foot examinations remains consistently below 60% in most studies.</p>
<p>Most cases of lower extremity limb loss in the United States occur among people with diabetes who have a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). These DFUs and the associated limb loss that may occur lead to excess healthcare costs and have a large negative impact on mobility, psychosocial well-being, and quality of life. The strategies for DFU prevention and management are evolving, but the implementation of these prevention and management strategies remains challenging. Barriers to implementation include poor access to primary medical care; patient beliefs and lack of adherence to medical advice; delays in DFU recognition; limited healthcare resources and practice heterogeneity of specialists.</p>
<p>The primary risk factor for diabetic ulcerations is loss of protective sensation (peripheral neuropathy). A yearly neurological examination of the lower extremity for a person with diabetes is essential. Risk classification based on neurologic findings and an appropriate treatment plan based on risk category can lead to a significant decrease in ulcerations and amputations. Diabetes and subsequent foot complications affect incredibly high numbers of people. The cost in both money and quality of life for the person with diabetes who develops an ulceration that leads to an amputation is staggering. The five year survival rate for a person with diabetes that undergoes an amputation is less than many forms of cancer (Frykberg et al., 2000).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Recommendation Statements</span></strong>:</p>
<p>Recognizing important risk factors and making a logical, treatment-oriented assessment of the diabetic foot requires a consistent and thorough diagnostic approach using a common language. Without such a method, the practitioner is more likely to overlook vital information and to pay inordinate attention to less critical points in the evaluation. A useful examination will involve identification of key risk factors and assignment into appropriate risk category. Only then can an effective treatment plan be designed and implemented (Frykberg et al., 2000).</p>
<p>For all patients with diabetes, perform an annual comprehensive foot examination to identify risk factors predictive of ulcers and amputations. The foot examination should include inspection, assessment of foot pulses, and testing for loss of protective sensation (LOPS) (10-g monofilament plus testing any one of the following: vibration using 128-Hz tuning fork, pinprick sensation, ankle reflexes, or vibration perception threshold) (American Diabetes Association, 2014).</p>
<p>Risk categorization should be done according to the following table and follow-up treatment plan should be done according to the following table:</p>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The 2012 document produced by the American Medical Association (AMA) and National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) noted that "just 55% of people with diabetes obtain annual foot examinations." They further note that "racial and ethnic disparities persist as well. African Americans and Hispanics are significantly more likely to die of diabetes-related complications than are Caucasians, while Native Americans and other vulnerable populations suffer under a disproportionate burden of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality." </li>
    <li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) examined the proportion of diabetic adults (over age 18) that received a foot exam in a given year. This data was categorized based on race/ethnicity, age, sex, and education level. In 2010, hispanics had the lowest percentage of foot exams (59%) in comparison to whites (71%) and blacks (77%) (CDC, "By Race/Ethnicity," 2012). In the same year, smaller disparities were seen according to age. Nearly 75% of all adults with diabetes between ages 65 to 74 received a foot exam, about 73% of adults between ages 45 to 64 and 71.5% of adults over age 75 (CDC, "By Age," 2012). There were not significant disparities by gender: In 2010, 72.3% of males and 70.7% of females received foot exams (CDC, "By Sex," 2012). Adults with an education greater than high school received foot exams at 70% while adults with only a high school education received foot exams at 67.8%; this gap widens for adults that achieved less than a high school education with only 59.1% receiving foot exams (CDC, "By Education," 2012). </li>
    <li>The cost of diabetic foot ulcers is greater than that of the five most costly forms of cancer (Barshes et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>Diabetic foot ulcer patients are twice as costly to United States (U.S.) Medicare as those with diabetes alone (Rice et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>Inpatient care constitutes nearly two thirds of insurance costs for diabetic foot ulcers (Rice et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>The estimated annual U.S. burden of diabetic foot ulcers is at least $15 Billion (Rice et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>Sixty percent to 70% of those with diabetes will develop peripheral neuropathy, or lose sensation in their feet (Dyck et al., 1999) </li>
    <li>More than 90% of people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy are unaware they have it (Bongaerts et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>Up to 25% of those with diabetes will develop a foot ulcer (Singh, Armstrong, &amp; Lipsky, 2005). </li>
    <li>The yearly incidence of diabetic foot ulcers ranges from 2% to 32%, depending on American Diabetes Association (ADA) risk classification (Boulton et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>More than half of all foot ulcers (wounds) will become infected, requiring hospitalization and 20% of infections result in amputation (Lavery et al., 2006). </li>
    <li>Diabetes contributes to approximately 80% of the 120,000 nontraumatic amputations performed yearly in the United States (Armstrong &amp; Lavery, 1998). </li>
    <li>After a major amputation, 50% of people will have their other limb amputated within 2 years (Goldner, 1960). </li>
    <li>People with a history of a diabetic foot ulcer have a 40% greater 10-year mortality than people with diabetes alone (Iversen et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>Each $1 invested in care by a podiatrist for people with diabetes results in $27 to $51 of healthcare savings (Carls et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>Podiatry care not only reduces amputation risk, but also dramatically impacts rate of hospitalization and reulceration (Gibson et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>Podiatric medical care in people with history of diabetic foot ulcer can reduce high-level amputation from between 65% and 80% (Gibson et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>Instituting a structured diabetic foot program can yield a 75% reduction in amputation rates and a near four-fold reduction in inpatient mortality (Weck et al., 2013). </li>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Measures Tested</strong></p>
<p>Measures from the <em>Diabetes Mellitus: Foot and Ankle Care</em> measure set tested in the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) Testing project: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Ulcer Prevention - Evaluation of Footwear </li>
    <li>Peripheral Neuropathy - Neurological Evaluation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>Three physician office sites participated in this measure testing project. Originally, four sites were identified and selected by Dr. James R. Christina, Director of Scientific Affairs for the APMA. One site withdrew due to time constraints resulting from a change in practice ownership.</p>
<p>All three physician office sites participating in this measure testing project represented urban settings on the East Coast. The practices each had two or more physicians, with physicians actively involved with APMA.</p>
<p>Two trained data abstractors performed on-site chart reviews the weeks of October 1 and November 5, 2012. Testing was performed on paper medical records at one physician office site and in the electronic health record (EHR) environment for two physician office sites. The case samples for chart reviews were randomly selected from eligible patients seen at two of the test sites between January 1 and December 31, 2011. Due to a change in the billing system, one test site requested a change in the chart sample timeframe to October 1, 2011 through May 1, 2012 to allow for accurate identification of eligible patients.</p>
<p><strong>Testing Performed and Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Feasibility</em>: Test site personnel completed a data collection questionnaire to provide information about the presence and location of each data element comprising the two measures within the medical record to assess the feasibility of data capture, calculation and reporting of the performance measures in a timely manner and at reasonable cost.</p>
<p><em>Results</em>: This test revealed that it was feasible to implement these performance measures at the test sites with some EHR modifications.</p>
<p><strong>Validation Against the Gold Standard Reliability</strong></p>
<p>Parallel-forms reliability testing was performed by comparing manual abstraction of the data elements necessary to construct the measure from the medical records with Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) claims submission. Agreement was calculated between the two methods at the level of the numerator, denominator and exception (if applicable).</p>
<p>To validate inclusion in the numerator, the practice sites provided various identification methods. Two practices provided a report of the sampled list of patients per encounter with the PQRS codes submitted. The third site provided instructions on viewing the billing codes per dates or invoice within each patient's medical record.</p>
<p>Agreement rates were calculated and reported with kappa statistics with 95% confidence intervals to recognize any agreement that could be attributable to chance alone.</p>
<p><em>Results</em>: The measures were found to be highly reliable with agreement rates ranging from 93 to 100%.</p>
