<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Arteriovenous (AV) fistulas have the best 5-year patency rates and require the fewest interventions compared with other access types. A study using data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) (2009) showed that patients receiving dialysis through catheters or AV grafts have greater mortality risk than patients dialyzed with fistula. Furthermore, infection-related deaths were significantly higher for catheters as compared to fistulas, in both diabetic and non-diabetic end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Finally, the advantages of AV fistula over other accesses are clearly delineated in the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines (2006), summarized as follows: (1) AV fistulas have the lowest rate of thrombosis and require the fewest interventions, (2) cost of AV fistula use and maintenance is the lowest, (3) fistulas have the lowest rates of infection, and (4) fistulas are associated with the highest survival and lowest hospitalization rates. Indeed, the epidemiologic studies referenced below consistently demonstrate the reduced morbidity and mortality associated with greater use of AV fistulas for vascular access in maintenance hemodialysis.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing </strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing </em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility level monthly and annual performance scores. They assessed reliability by calculating inter-unit reliability (IUR) for each reporting month and the overall 12 months. The monthly based measure was a simple average across individuals in the facility. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based measure, however, is not a simple average and the developer instead estimates the IUR using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. The developer notes that the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. Since this measure is not normally distributed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution. </p>
<p>The developer also did a comparison of the data elements used to calculate this measure in order to assess comparability of the calculations using two Medicare data sources. The measure was calculated using Medicare claims and using CROWNWeb clinical data. </p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing </em></p>
<p>For reliability the developer calculated the monthly and annual IUR across the 12 reporting months. As explained above, the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. IUR=0.75637, which is high and suggests 76% of variation in the measure is attributed to between facility variation. </p>
<p><em>Interpretation </em></p>
<p>The IUR suggests this measure is reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong> </p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em> </p>
<p>Validity was assessed using Poisson regression models to measure the association between facility level quintiles of performance scores and the 2013 standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (NQF 0369) and 2013 standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR) (NQF 1463), respectively, both NQF-endorsed measures. Facility-level performance scores were divided into quintiles and the relative risk (RR) of mortality was calculated for each quintile. The fifth quintile was used as the reference group. Thus, a RR greater than 1.0 for the lower performance score quintiles would indicate a higher relative risk of mortality or hospitalization. </p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing </em></p>
<p>Quintiles of the performance scores were defined as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Q1: 0.0% to less than 58.4% </li>
    <li>Q2: 58.4% to less than 64.9% </li>
    <li>Q3: 64.9% to less than 70.4% </li>
    <li>Q4: 70.4% to less than 76.6% </li>
    <li>Q5: 76.6% to less than or equal to 100.0% </li>
</ul>
<p>Results from the Poisson model indicated the percent of patients dialyzing with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula was significantly associated with both SMR (p less than 0.0001) and SHR (p less than 0.0001). For SMR, the RR of mortality was highest in the lowest performance measure quintile (RR=1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14, 1.19). For quintile 2, RR=1.08 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.11), quintile 3, RR=1.08 (95% CI: 1.05 to 1.11) and was 1.06 for quintile 4 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.08). Similarly for SHR, the RR of hospitalization was highest in the lowest performance measure quintile (RR=1.22; 95% CI: 1.22, 1.22). For quintile 2, RR=1.14 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.14), quintile 3, RR=1.13 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.13) and was 1.08 for quintile 4 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.08). </p>
<p><em>Interpretation </em></p>
<p>These results suggest the predictive relationship of higher AV fistula use with lower mortality and hospitalization, as measured by the respective standardized mortality and hospitalization rates, compared to facilities with lower AV fistula use. </p></div>
