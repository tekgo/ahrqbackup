<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of therapeutic recommendations (Strong, Moderate, Optional) is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The Taiwan Department of Health has updated the labeling for allopurinol to include information on <em>human leukocyte antigen B&nbsp;(HLA-B)*58:01</em> (<a href="http://www.doh.gov.tw/EN2006/Newsroom/Press_list.aspx?year=2009&amp;doc_no=72847" title="Taiwan Department of Health Web site">http://www.doh.gov.tw/EN2006/Newsroom/Press_list.aspx?year=2009&amp;doc_no=72847</a>). The updated label describes the strong association between <em>HLA-B*58:01</em> and allopurinol-induced Stevens&ndash;Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in the Han-Chinese population and recommends testing for the allele before the use of allopurinol. The updated label does not recommend such testing for patients who have had no adverse events after prolonged use of allopurinol. At the time of writing this article, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had not updated the labeling for allopurinol. However, given the high specificity for allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), allopurinol should not be prescribed to patients who have tested positive for <em>HLA-B*58:01</em>. Alternative medication should be considered for these patients to avoid the risk of developing SCAR. For patients who have tested negative, allopurinol may be prescribed as usual (see the table below). However, testing negative for <em>HLA-B*58:01</em> does not totally eliminate the possibility of developing SCAR, especially in the European population.</p>
<p>Several clinical factors have been reported to be associated with an increased risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity. Renal dysfunction is the most significant nongenetic factor, and patients with renal insufficiency were four times more likely to develop adverse events than those with normal renal function. The risk of allopurinol-induced hypersensitivity is also reported to increase with the concomitant use of ampicillin or amoxicillin.</p>
<p>In addition to SCAR, allopurinol therapy is also associated with a 2%&ndash;3% incidence of less severe rashes unassociated with systemic symptoms or organ damage. FDA guidelines recommend discontinuing allopurinol if a rash develops. Until recently, only uricosuric drugs such as probenecid and benzbromarone were available for the patients who need to discontinue allopurinol due to skin rash. However, probenecid is often less effective than allopurinol, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency, and benzbromarone is not an approved drug in many countries. This has prompted attempts to induce tolerance to allopurinol by rechallenge with gradual escalation of low doses as tolerated. This unreliable approach has not been widely accepted, and its use may decline because alternative urate-lowering therapies are now available. Febuxostat, which received FDA approval in 2009, is available in 19 countries. It is a nonpurine xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is primarily metabolized in the liver to inactive glucuronide and excreted into the urine and bile. Therefore, mild to moderate renal impairment might have little impact on the pharmacokinetics of febuxostat. It was reported to be tolerated in 12 of 13 patients with a history of severe allopurinol hypersensitivity. In 2010, the FDA approved pegloticase, a PEGylated urate oxidase, as an orphan drug for treating patients with refractory chronic gout who had an inadequate response to, or were intolerant of, other urate-lowering drugs. Newer urate-lowering drugs are in clinical trials.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors searched the PubMed database (1966 to October 2011) for keywords ((HLA OR HLA-B OR HLA-B58 OR HLA-B*58:01) AND (allopurinol)), and retrieved fifty articles. Of those fifty the majority were review articles. The guideline authors identified nine primary studies of the pharmacogenomics of allopurinol hypersensitivity and one meta-analysis. The recent meta-analysis of <em>human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B)*5801</em> and allopurinol-induced Stevens&ndash;Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) stated that in their literature review they found only six relevant primary studies in their database search that included MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), CINAHL, PsycINFO, the World Health Organization (WHO) International, Clinical Trial Registry, and <a href="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov" title="ClinicalTrials.gov Web site" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> from their inceptions to June 2011. The additional three studies included in the corpus of literature include those that used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) design and were published after June 2011. </p>
<p>To construct an <em>HLA-B*58:01</em> minor allele frequency table based on ethnicity, allele frequency information was obtained from Allele Frequency Net Database (<a href="http://www.allelefrequencies.net" title="Allele Frequency Net Database">www.allelefrequencies.net</a>). It is an online repository for HLA allele frequencies from both previously published and unpublished sources. All previously published data were manually checked against the original publications to verify the <em>HLA-B*58:01</em> allele frequencies. In some cases, sample sizes or allele frequencies were updated to reflect only subjects successfully genotyped for <em>HLA-B*58:01</em> (rather than the total sample size of the study) or to correct errata in the original publication. The combined analysis included 38,979 Caucasians, 5,811 Black or Africans, 882 Middle Easterners, 3,318 Hispanic or Latino and 11,531 Asians.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors searched the PubMed database (1966 to October 2014) for keywords (HLA OR HLA-B OR HLA-B58 OR HLA-B*5801) AND (allopurinol). Using these search terms, 77 publications were identified. In addition, studies annotated in PharmGKB (<a href="http://www.pharmgkb.org" title="Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase Web site">http://www.pharmgkb.org</a>) were identified. Study inclusion criteria included publications that included analyses of the effect of <em>HLA</em> alleles on clinical outcomes of allopurinol use, and non-English manuscripts were excluded. Following application of these inclusion criteria, 26 publications were reviewed and included in the evidence table (Table S3 in the 2015 supplemental information [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Associations with other alleles were also collected and the positive associations found in more than one study are represented in Table S3.</p>
<p>To construct an <em>HLA-B*58:01</em> minor allele frequency table based on ethnicity, allele frequency information was obtained from Allele Frequency Net Database (<a href="http://www.allelefrequencies.net" title="Allele Frequency Net Database">www.allelefrequencies.net</a>), an online repository for HLA allele frequencies from both previously published and unpublished sources. Allele frequency search/classical was carried out for <em>HLA-B*58:01</em> (accessed Dec 1st 2014).</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Given the high negative predictive value of the allele, especially in patients of Asian descent (&gt;99%), <em>human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B)*58:01</em> testing could significantly reduce the incidence and risk for allopurinol-associated severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR).</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>As with any laboratory test, one potential risk could come from genotyping error. A false-negative genotyping result could lead to allopurinol-induced adverse events. </li>
    <li>Genotypes are lifelong characteristics; such errors could have a broader health implication if other associations with <em>human leukocyte antigen B&nbsp;(HLA-B)*58:01</em> are identified in the future. </li>
    <li>Several clinical factors have been reported to be associated with an increased risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity. Renal dysfunction is the most significant nongenetic factor, and patients with renal insufficiency were four times more likely to develop adverse events than those with normal renal function. The risk of allopurinol-induced hypersensitivity is also reported to increase with the concomitant use of ampicillin or amoxicillin. </li>
    <li>In addition to severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR), allopurinol therapy is also associated with a 2%&ndash;3% incidence of less severe rashes unassociated with systemic symptoms or organ damage. Food and Drug Administration guidelines recommend discontinuing allopurinol if a rash develops. </li>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The positive predictive value for <em>human leukocyte antigen B&nbsp;(HLA-B)*58:01</em> is ~1.5% and the negative predictive value is 100% (based on the data from the Han-Chinese and Thai populations). Therefore, a significant number of patients carrying the allele will not develop severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) when they receive allopurinol treatment. New genetic factors may be identified in the future to differentiate the <em>HLA-B*58:01</em> carriers who are or are not likely to develop SCAR. The most severe SCAR (toxic epidermal necrolysis) carries a 30% mortality rate. However, further study is warranted on the development of SCAR in European populations. </li>
    <li><em>HLA-B*58:01</em> predicts only allopurinol-induced SCAR, not other adverse events (such as mild skin rash) that a patient might experience during allopurinol treatment. The marker also does not predict the efficacy of treatment with allopurinol. Regardless of the genotyping results, physicians should monitor patients closely. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision making, in addition to identifying questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for all individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the health-care provider to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be solely made by the clinician and the patient. CPIC assumes no responsibility for any injury to persons or damage to property related to any use of CPIC's guidelines, or for any errors or omissions.</p></div>
