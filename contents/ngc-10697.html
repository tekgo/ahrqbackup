<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Review</strong></p>
<p>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team's nursing research associate searched an established list of websites for guidelines and other relevant content published. It captured relevant literature published between 2004 and 2013 and guidelines published between 2005 and 2013. This list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice websites and recommendations from the literature. Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of websites searched and inclusion criteria, is available online at <a href="http://www.RNAO.ca" title="RNAO Web site">www.RNAO.ca</a>. Guidelines were also identified by members of the expert panel.</p>
<p><strong>Systematic Review</strong></p>
<p>Concurrent with the review of existing guidelines, a search for recent literature relevant to the scope of this Guideline was conducted with guidance from the RNAO expert panel co-chairs. The systematic literature search was conducted by a health-sciences librarian. The search, limited to English-language articles published between 2004 and 2013, was applied to Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), EMBASE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ERIC, and PsycINFO databases. Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms, is available online at <a href="http://www.RNAO.ca" title="RNAO Web site">www.RNAO.ca</a>. Four research associates (nurses holding master's degrees) independently assessed the eligibility of studies according to established inclusion and exclusion criteria. RNAO's best practice guideline program manager, working with the expert panel, resolved disagreements.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Review</strong></p>
<p>Members of the expert panel and two of Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO)'s nursing research associates critically appraised 12 international guidelines using the <em>Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II</em>. From this review, the 9 guidelines were selected to inform the review process.</p>
<p><strong>Systematic Review</strong></p>
<p>Quality appraisal scores for 20 articles (a random sample of 10% of articles eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by RNAO best practice guideline research associates. Acceptable inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic [K], GS/DA K = 0.69; DA/MB K = 0.69) justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction by dividing the remaining studies equally between the four research associates. Validated quality appraisal tools were used to assess all articles included in the systematic review (i.e., AMSTAR, CASP tools, Evaluative Tools for Mixed Method Studies, Cochrane Public Health). A final summary of literature findings was completed. The comprehensive data tables and summary were provided to all RNAO's expert panel members. In September 2013, the expert panel convened to revise and achieve consensus on Guideline recommendations and discussion of evidence based on strong and moderate quality-level evidence where available (i.e., quality appraisal scores).</p>
<p>A review of the most recent literature and relevant guidelines published between 2004 and 2013 resulted in a substantial update of existing recommendations, as well as the inclusion of stronger evidence for new or revised recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>To prepare the second edition of this guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled an expert panel composed of nurses, other health-care professionals, health-care administrators, and community social services workers, some of whom had served on the previous expert panel and some of whom are new members who bring additional expertise in particular practice areas. A systematic review of the evidence took into consideration the scope of the original Guideline (2005) and was supported by three clinical questions. It captured relevant literature between 2004 and 2013 and guidelines published between 2005 and 2013. These are the research questions that guided the systematic review:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What are the effective obesity-prevention nursing interventions for children? </li>
    <li>What education do nurses need to effectively prevent childhood obesity? </li>
    <li>What organizational or political supports are necessary to provide a supportive practice environment for the implementation and evaluation of high-quality, evidence-based nursing care in childhood obesity? </li>
</ol>
<p>The expert panel's mandate was to review the original Guideline in light of the new evidence in order to ensure the validity, appropriateness, and safety of the recommendations. Where necessary, sections have been updated to take into account new evidence. This edition is the result of the expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence into the recommendations and supporting evidence from the first edition (where applicable).</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Among other benefits, tailoring interventions allows health-care providers to account for cultural preferences and neighbourhood characteristics (e.g., walkability of sidewalks, housing and safety) that place children at increased risk for obesity. </li>
    <li>Systematic review evidence demonstrates that stakeholder involvement builds community capacity and creates interventions that are tailored to the community's needs, which in turn increases support, improves program and policy delivery, and sustains momentum. Engaging community stakeholders across multiple settings, such as in schools, childcare centers and in the broader community, ensures consistency and the reinforcement of messages used in the intervention. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The expert panel cautions that anthropometric measures should be collected with sensitivity for their potential psychosocial impact on children (e.g., self-esteem; body image; labeling). While the systematic review found very few studies that measured the psychosocial outcomes of growth and development assessment in the context of obesity prevention in children, the expert panel urges health-care providers to be mindful of the potential for these unintended consequences, seek appropriate training on how to sensitively collect data from children and accurately interpret the corresponding growth charts.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Implementation Strategies</strong></p>
<p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice, and in the case of a guideline focused on population health, to create a societal shift toward healthy outcomes. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario's (RNAO) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines (2nd ed.)</em> provides an evidence-informed process for doing this.</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health care is more likely when:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses the "Knowledge-to-Action" framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.</p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of their Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including the Nursing Best Practice Champion Network&reg;, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs; and the Best Practice Spotlight Organization&reg; (BPSO&reg;) designation, which supports implementation at the organizational and system levels. BPSOs focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs. In addition, the authors offer capacity-building learning institutes on specific guidelines and their implementation annually.</p>
