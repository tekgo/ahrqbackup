Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendations (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level II</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Indirect calorimetry as the best means to determine the caloric needs of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients is recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level III</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Nutritional support of SCI patients is recommended as soon as feasible. It appears that early enteral nutrition (initiated within 72 hours) is safe, but has not been shown to affect neurological outcome, the length of stay, or the incidence of complications in patients with acute SCI. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>Alterations in metabolism occur after acute SCI, but the marked hypermetabolic response seen after acute traumatic brain injury appears to be blunted in SCI patients by the flaccidity of denervated musculature after spinal cord transection/injury. As a result, resting energy expenditure (REE) is lower than predicted after acute SCI. Equation estimates of REE in these patients have proven to be inaccurate. Comparative <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence supports the use of indirect calorimetry as the recommended technique to assess energy expenditure in both the acute and chronic settings among patients with SCI.</p>
<p>Protein catabolism does occur after acute, severe SCI, and marked losses in lean body mass due to muscle atrophy result in huge nitrogen losses, prolonged negative nitrogen balance, and rapid weight loss. Nutritional support of the SCI patient to meet caloric and nitrogen needs, not to achieve nitrogen balance, is safe and may reduce the deleterious effects of the catabolic, nitrogen wasting process that occurs after acute SCI. It appears that early enteral nutrition (initiated within 72 hours) is safe, but has not been shown to affect neurological outcome, the length of stay, or the incidence of complications in patients with acute SCI.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search from 1966 to 2011 was undertaken using Medical Subject Headings in combination with "spinal cord injury": "nutrition" (138 citations) and "nutritional support" (73 citations). Non-English language and duplicate citations were deleted. Titles and abstracts of the remaining publications were reviewed. A focused search on the specific issue of nutrition and human patients with acute spinal cord injuries (SCI) identified 16 citations. Relevant manuscripts and reviews describing nutritional support of head-injured patients and several reports describing the nutritional status of chronic SCI patients are included in the bibliography. These efforts identified 7 Class III medical evidence studies, which describe metabolism, nitrogen wasting and the effect of feeding on nitrogen balance, and serum biochemistries in patients after acute SCI. Four of the 7 citations offer Class II medical evidence on indirect calorimetry to assess energy expenditure after SCI. There were no studies that examined the effects of nutritional support on neurological outcome following acute SCI.</p></div>

<p>On occasion, the assessed quality of the study design was so contentious and the conclusions so uncertain that the guideline authors assigned a lower medical evidence classification than might have been expected without such a detailed review.

<p>Articles that did not achieve immediate consensus among the author group were discussed extensively until a consensus was reached. Very few contributions required extensive discussion.

Potential Benefits

Nasoduodenal or nasojejunal feeding tubes usually allow full caloric, high-nitrogen, high-volume feeding within days of injury.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In a published retrospective study of a group of 33 patients who received enteral feeding at a median of 2 days (range 0.5-4.8 days) following admission, the most common reason for interruption of enteral feeds was high gastric aspirates, which occurred in 67% of patients. Two patients developed ileus, requiring conversion from nasogastric to nasojejunal feeding tubes.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
