Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the average score for the "Delivery System Design/Decision Support" subscale on the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) Survey.</p>
<p>Patients report (1 = "None of the time," 2 = "A little of the time," 3 = "Some of the time," 4 = "Most of the time," and 5 = "Always") on the following items: </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Over the past 6 months</span>, when I received care for my chronic conditions, I was:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Given a written list of things I should do to improve my health. </li>
    <li>Satisfied that my care was well organized. </li>
    <li>Shown how what I did to take care of myself influenced my condition. </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <a href="/browse/by-organization-indiv.aspx?orgid=2509&amp;objid=48032" title="Measure Collection">PACIC</a> consists of five scales and an overall summary score. Each scale is scored by averaging the items completed within that scale, and the overall PACIC is scored by averaging scores across all 20 items.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The increasingly well-documented gap between clinical research findings and practice (Institute of Medicine [IOM], Committee on Quality of Health Care in America, 2001; Lenfant, 2003; McGlynn et al., 2003) has spurred a number of efforts to improve the quality of chronic illness care (Bodenheimer, Wagner, &amp; Grumbach, 2002; Wagner, Austin, &amp; Von Korff, 1996). It also is apparent that this problem cannot be solved by simply trying to do more; instead, fundamental changes are needed in the way that care is structured and delivered. For chronic illness care, this change entails shifting from medical care that is reactive and event-driven to care that is proactive and planned.</p>
<p>The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) is designed to complement the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) by providing a patient perspective on receipt of Chronic Care Model (CCM)-related chronic illness care. The PACIC collects patient reports of the extent to which they have received specific actions and care during the past 6 months that are congruent with various aspects of the CCM. This scale is intended to assess the receipt of patient-centered care, which emphasizes the key elements of modern self-management support (e.g., collaborative goal settings, problem-solving and follow-up) (Glasgow et al., 2002; Williams, Freedman, &amp; Deci, 1998; Glasgow et al., 2003) and planned, proactive, and population-based care (Bodenheimer, Wagner, &amp; Grumbach, 2002; Wagner, Austin, &amp; Von Korff, 1996; Von Korff et al., 1997; Wagner et al., 1999). The goal was to develop a relatively brief instrument that could be used in a variety of health care settings and would be applicable to adult patients having one or more of many different chronic illnesses.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Sample</strong><br />
A total of 283 adults reporting one or more chronic illness from a large integrated health care delivery system were studied. </p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong><br />
Participants completed the 20-item Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) as well as measures of demographic factors, a patient activation scale, and subscales from a primary care assessment instrument so that we could evaluate measurement performance, construct, and concurrent validity of the PACIC.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong><br />
The PACIC consists of 5 scales and an overall summary score, each having good internal consistency for brief scales. As predicted, the PACIC was only slightly correlated with age and gender, and unrelated to education. Contrary to prediction, it was only slightly correlated (r = 0.13) with number of chronic conditions. The PACIC demonstrated moderate test-retest reliability (r = 0.58 during the course of 3 months) and was correlated moderately, as predicted (r = 0.32 to 0.60, median = 0.50, P &lt; 0.001) to measures of primary care and patient activation.</p>
<p>The PACIC appears to be a practical instrument that is reliable and has face, construct, and concurrent validity.</p>
