Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/fhp/practiceguides/cad.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the original guideline document for additional information.</p>
<p>The levels of evidence (A&ndash;D) and strength of recommendation (I&ndash;III) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary prevention</strong>. Patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) or stroke should receive intensive secondary prevention interventions, which offer large absolute risk reductions for subsequent events and mortality <em>[IA]</em>. Table 1 below summarizes secondary prevention recommendations for the main and modifiable risk factors listed below for patients with coronary and other vascular disease. Less common risk factors for ischemic vascular disease (IVD) are not addressed in this guideline.</p>

For patients unsuitable for anticoagulation, aspirin 325 mg, although less effective, is the preferred antiplatelet alternative <em>[IIB]</em>.

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The overview of secondary prevention recommendations was assembled from existing guidelines. The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) has already developed guidelines addressing many of the components of secondary prevention (i.e., tobacco cessation, hypertension, lipid management, diabetes mellitus, obesity [physical activity, weight management, nutrition], and immunizations). The review began with the UMHS guidelines and the national guidelines referenced in them. The review expanded to other relevant guidelines of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the American Stroke Association (ASA). Then evidence from relevant guidelines referenced in those guidelines and other relevant national guidelines known to the authors were added. The search focused on guidelines published from January 2000 through July 2008 to produce the 2009 version of this guideline. This 2014 update included similar searches for evidence in more current guidelines over the period from August 2008 through December 2013. The section of this guideline on "Related National Guidelines" lists twenty current national guidelines on which this overview is based.</p>
<p>The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

<h3>
Potential Benefits

<ul type="disc">
<li>Reduced risk of subsequent cardiac events and mortality</li>
<li>Prevention of coronary artery disease and other vascular disease</li></ul>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert regarding serious neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in patients taking varenicline; however, it still continues to be considered first line therapy. Clinicians should elicit information on their patients' psychiatric history and monitor them for changes in mood or behavior on therapy. </li>
    <li>Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Prasugrel is not recommended in patients older than 75 years of age except in those patients with diabetes or prior history of myocardial infarction (MI). Prasugrel has not been studied in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). </li>
        <li>Ticagrelor is associated with higher rates of transient dyspnea and bradycardia. Ticagrelor has not been studied in elective PCI. </li>
        <li>The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel increases the risk of bleeding without reducing the risk of stroke, therefore, the long-term use of dual antiplatelet therapy cannot be recommended for non-cardioembolic stroke. </li>
        <li>Anticoagulation with warfarin or one of the three new anticoagulants increases the risk of bleeding without reducing the risk of ischemic events in patients with stroke due to cardioemboli. </li>
        <li>Antiplatelet therapy reduces risk of cardiovascular events, but increases risk for gastrointestinal (GI) tract bleeding. </li>
        <li>There are limited data on the safety of "triple therapy" with aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin, leading to significant concerns about the risk of bleeding. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the acute setting, the routine use of intravenous (IV) &beta; blockers for all patients is not recommended, as it may be harmful to administer them to those with contraindications to beta blockade, signs of heart failure or low output state, or other risk factors for cardiogenic shock. </li>
    <li>Serum potassium should be monitored closely during treatment with aldosterone blockade. Although uncommon, life-threatening hyperkalemia can occur due to the combination of aldosterone inhibition, reduced aldosterone secretion associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy, and a progressive decline in renal perfusion due to heart failure. </li>
    <li>The selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and other nonselective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The risk of cardiovascular events is proportional to COX-2 selectivity. </li>
    <li>Of note, some herbal remedies can have cardiotoxic properties, some may lower serum potassium, and some may interact with cardiovascular drugs. </li>
    <li>Patient selection for carotid revascularization is important as perioperative risks can negate potential benefits from the procedure. </li>
</ul>

</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Nicotine transdermal formulations are contraindicated in patients with arrhythmias, worsening angina, severe angina, and within 2 weeks of myocardial infarction. Use nicotine supplements with caution in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). </li>
    <li>Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a prior history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). </li>
    <li>The new oral anticoagulants are contraindicated for patients with renal failure and caution should be used in patients with renal impairment. </li>
    <li>Influenza vaccine is contraindicated in patients with severe egg allergy or previous allergy/anaphylaxis to influenza vaccine and cautioned with previous Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. </li>
    <li>Ephedra, oleander, or other herbal/botanicals have well-defined contraindications to cardiovascular drug and or cardiovascular disease (CVD) conditions. </li>
    <li>Anticoagulation with any agent is not recommended immediately after an acute stroke due to the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. </li>
    <li>With the exception of aspirin, all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors should be discontinued immediately at the time of an acute coronary syndrome presentation. </li>
