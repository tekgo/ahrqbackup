<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is not recommended for the treatment of chronic low back pain due to lack of proven efficacy (<strong>Level A, 2 Class I studies</strong>). </li>
    <li>TENS should be considered for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy (<strong>Level B, 2 Class II studies</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Classification of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with masked outcome assessment, in a representative population. The following are required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Primary outcome(s) is/are clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria are clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for dropouts and crossovers with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias </li>
    <li>Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Prospective matched group cohort study in a representative population, with masked outcome assessment that meets a-d above OR a randomized controlled trial in a representative population that lacks one criterion a-d.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: All other controlled trials including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls in a representative population, where outcome assessment is independently assessed or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.*</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Evidence from uncontrolled studies, case series, case reports, or expert opinion.</p>
<p class="Note">*Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data)</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if: 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A Medline search from inception to April 2009 was performed, using the terms "transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation" (Medical Subject Headings [MeSH]) and "nervous system diseases" (MeSH) or "peripheral nervous system diseases" (MeSH) or "central nervous system diseases" (MeSH), which was limited to "clinical trial, meta-analysis, practice guideline, randomized controlled trial, human." The Cochrane Library was searched using the terms "transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation" or "TENS." Inclusion criteria were clinical trials of TENS compared to placebo or to another therapy for well-defined painful neurologic disorders with more than 10 subjects. Additional articles were obtained from the bibliographies of these articles and of review articles.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>Medline and Cochrane databases were searched from 2009 December 30 to 2015 January 24 using the terms "transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation," "nervous system diseases," "peripheral nervous system diseases," "central nervous system diseases," "TENS." Clinical trials of TENS compared to placebo or to another therapy for well‚Äêdefined painful neurologic disorders with more than 10 subjects were included.</p></div>

<h3>

<div class="content_para"><p>There were nine source documents. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria; two studies of chronic pain were excluded because etiologies of pain were diverse, and meaningful data on any one type of pain could not be extracted from presented data.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations were based on the level of evidence (see "Rating Scale for the Strength of the Recommendations"). Disagreement about the assigned level of evidence was resolved through discussion.</p>
<p>The Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee adopted the definitions used in each paper for meaningful reduction in pain, realizing that this varies between treatments for acute and for chronic pain. Although the World Health Organization classifies significant pain reduction in the treatment of patients with cancer as &gt;50% using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) or a decrease to a level of 3 or less using a verbal rating scale of pain intensity from 0 to 10, the definition of meaningful pain reduction is controversial. Thus, many of the articles used a decrease of 20 mm or a 25% decrease with a baseline VAS of 50 mm or less clinically significant.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>An author conducted a literature search using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. Because the guideline recommendations would not change given the new literature available, the committee voted to reaffirm the guideline, stating that the conclusions and recommendations are still valid.</p></div>
