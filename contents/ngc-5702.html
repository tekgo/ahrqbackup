Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (I-III) and levels of recommendations (A-C) are defined at the end of the &quot;Major Recommendations&quot; field.</p>

<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Uterotonic agents should be the first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony.</li>

<li>Management may vary greatly among patients, depending on etiology and available treatment options, and often a multidisciplinary approach is required.</li>

<li>When uterotonics fail following vaginal delivery, exploratory laparotomy is the next step.</li>

<li>In the presence of conditions known to be associated with placenta accreta, the obstetric care provider must have a high clinical suspicion and take appropriate precautions.</li></ul>

<p><strong><u>Definitions</u></strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>

<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</p>

<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>

<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case&#8211;control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>

<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>

<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>

<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>

<p><strong>Level A</strong> &#8212; Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Level B</strong> &#8212; Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Level C</strong> &#8212; Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>2006 Original Document</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 1901 and June 2006. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles.</p>
<p><strong>2013 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>The NCBI database was searched from 2006 to 2013. Committee members conducted a literature search with the assistance from the ACOG Resource Center staff who routinely perform the Practice Bulletin literature searches.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>2006 Original Document</strong></p>
<p>Analysis of available evidence was given priority in formulating recommendations. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists were used.

<p><strong>2013 Reaffirmation</strong></p>
<p>The Committee on Practice Bulletins - Obstetrics met in October 2013 and reaffirmed this document. A committee member reviewed the document and new literature on the topic. The document was then reviewed by the committee and the committee agreed that it is current and accurate.</p></div>
