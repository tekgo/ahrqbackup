Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of uncomplicated cataract who had cataract surgery and no significant ocular conditions impacting the visual outcome of surgery and had best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better (distance or near) achieved within 90 days following the cataract surgery.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The only reason to perform cataract surgery (other than for a limited set of medical indications) is to improve a patient's vision and associated functioning. The use of a 20/40 visual acuity threshold is based on several considerations. First, it is the level for unrestricted operation of a motor vehicle in the United States (U.S). Second, it has been consistently used by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its assessment for approval of intraocular lens (IOL) and other vision devices. Third, it is the literature standard to denote success in cataract surgery. Fourth, work by West et al. (1997) in the Salisbury Eye Study, suggests that 20/40 is a useful threshold for 50th percentile functioning for several vision-related tasks.</p>
<p>Most patients achieve excellent visual acuity after cataract surgery (20/40 or better). This outcome is achieved consistently through careful attention through the accurate measurement of axial length and corneal power and the appropriate selection of an IOL power calculation formula. As such, it reflects the care and diligence with which the surgery is assessed, planned and executed. Failure to achieve this after surgery in eyes without comorbid ocular conditions that would impact the success of the surgery would reflect care that should be assessed for opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>The exclusion of patients with other ocular and systemic conditions known to increase the risk of an adverse outcome reflects the findings of the two published prediction rule papers for cataract surgery outcomes, by Mangione et al. (1995) and Steinberg et al. (1994). In both papers, the presence of comorbid glaucoma and macular degeneration negatively impacted the likelihood of successful outcomes of surgery. Further, exclusion of eyes with ocular conditions that could impact the success of the surgery would NOT eliminate the large majority of eyes undergoing surgery while also minimizing the potential adverse selection that might otherwise occur relative to those patients with the most complex situations who might benefit the most from having surgery to maximize their remaining vision.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>This is an outcome measure. As such, there are no statements in the guideline specific to this measurement topic.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>This is an outcome of surgery indicator of direct relevance to patients and referring providers. The available evidence suggests that cataract surgery achieves this in between 86% and 98% of surgeries in eyes without comorbid ocular conditions. While small, the volume of cataract surgery in the United States (U.S.) of over 2.8 million surgeries suggests that the impact could affect more than 100,000 patients per year. Because of the exclusion of comorbid ocular conditions, one would expect performance on this indicator to be as high as possible, with significantly lower rates suggestive of opportunities for improvement. </p>
<p>Cataract surgery successfully restores vision in the majority of people who have the procedure. The ASCRS National Cataract Database reported that at 3 months postoperatively, 85.5% of all patients had a 20/40 or better best-corrected visual acuity, 57.2% of patients had 20/25 or better postoperative best-corrected visual acuity, and 74.6% of patients were within +/- 1.0 D of target spherical equivalent. Based on 5,788 responses, the mean visual function index score at 3 months postoperatively was 70.3% compared with 55.0% preoperatively (American Academy of Ophthalmology [AAO], 2011).</p>
<p>Additionally, data from a UK multi-center Cataract National Dataset found a postoperative visual acuity of 6/12 (20/40) or better was achieved for 94.7% of eyes with no co-pathologies and in 79.9% of eyes with one or more copathologies (Jaycock et al., 2009).</p>
<p>A rate of 85.5% to 94.7% of patients achieving a 20/40 or better visual acuity in the context of approximately 3 million cataract surgeries in the U.S. annually would mean that between 160,000 to 435,000 individuals would not achieve a 20/40 or better visual acuity which suggests an opportunity for improvement. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on several measure testing projects in 2012 and 2015 to ensure the Cataracts &ndash; Complications within 30 Days Following Cataracts Surgery measure and Cataracts &ndash; 20/40 or Better Visual Acuity within 90 Days Following Cataracts Surgery measures are reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator and exception case identification. The testing projects were conducted utilizing electronic health record data and registry data. Parallel forms reliability and signal-to-noise reliability were tested. One site participated in the parallel forms testing of the measures. Site A was a physician-owned multi-location suburban practice in a large Midwestern city with four physicians. Signal-to-noise reliability was assessed using 2013 data acquired from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Physician Quality Reporting System Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) database. An analysis of the measure exclusions was conducted using 2013 Medicare 5% Beneficiary claims data.</p>
<p><strong>Cataracts &ndash; 20/40 or Better Visual Acuity within 90 Days Following Cataracts Surgery</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parallel Forms Reliability Testing (Site A)</span></p>
<p>There were 149 observations from one site used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide by zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used. </p>
<p>Of the 149 observations that were initially selected, 149 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.85 demonstrates almost perfect agreement between the automated report and reviewer. </p>
<p>Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval)<br />
Denominator: 149, 100.0%, Non-Calculable* (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)* <br />
Numerator: 149, 92.6%, 0.85 (0.76, 0.93)</p>
<p class="Note">*Cannot calculate kappa statistics when only one response (Yes/Yes) was used, as this causes a divide-by-zero error in the statistic formula.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signal-to-Noise Reliability Testing</span></p>
<p>For this measure, the reliability at the minimum level of quality reporting events (10) was 0.47. The average number of quality reporting events for physicians included is 55.3. The reliability at the average number of quality reporting events was 0.83. </p>
<p>This measure has poor reliability when evaluated at the minimum level of quality reporting events and high reliability at the average number of quality events. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exclusions Analysis</span></p>
<p>Medicare 5% Beneficiary claims data sample, there were 46,715 unique individuals who had a cataract procedure in the first nine months of 2013 with a total of 70,773 procedures. Using the criteria for the measure, 17,735 (25.1%) procedures had a cataract measure exclusion associated with the procedure. </p></div>
