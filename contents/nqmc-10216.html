<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of final reports for computed tomography (CT) imaging studies of the thorax for patients aged 18 years and older with documented follow-up recommendations for incidentally detected pulmonary nodules (e.g., follow-up CT imaging studies needed or that no follow-up is needed) based at a minimum on nodule size and patient risk factors.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Pulmonary nodules are commonly encountered in both primary care and specialty settings (MacMahon et al., 2005; Gould et al., 2007). Pulmonary nodules require appropriate management (to avoid missing early malignancies or conversely subjecting patients to unnecessary follow-up scans (Gould et al., 2007).</p>
<p>At least 99% of all nodules 4 mm or smaller are benign and because such small opacities are common on thin-section computed tomography (CT) scans, follow-up CT is not recommended (Swensen, 2002). Additionally, there is no conclusive evidence that serial CT studies with early intervention for detected cancers can reduce disease-specific mortality, even in high-risk patients. Therefore, follow-up CT for every small indeterminate nodule is not recommended (MacMahon et al., 2005).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and/or other references</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fleischner Society Recommendations for Follow-up and Management of Nodules Smaller than 8mm Detected Incidentally at Nonscreening CT</span> (MacMahon et al., 2005).<br />
Since the decision to perform follow-up studies relies on size, lesion characteristics (e.g., morphology), and growth rates (typically described as doubling time), an understanding of these features and their relationship to malignancy should dictate further evaluation. In addition, the patient's risk profile, including age and smoking history, needs to be integrated into the diagnostic algorithm.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

    </ul>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Nodule size greater than 6 to 8 mm</strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Low-risk Patient: initial follow-up CT at 6 to 12 months, then at 18 to 24 months if no change </li>
        <li>High-risk Patient: initial follow-up CT at 3 to 6 months, then at 9 to 12 and 24 months if no change </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Nodule size greater than 8 mm</strong> <br />
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Same for Low- or High-risk Patient: follow-up CT at around 3, 9, and 24 months, dynamic contrast enhanced CT, positron emission tomography (PET), and/or biopsy </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Note</strong>: Newly detected indeterminate nodule in persons 35 years of age or older.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Low-risk Patient: Minimal or absent history of smoking and of other known risk factors. </li>
        <li>High-risk Patient: History of smoking or of other known risk factors. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">*Average of length and width. <br />
&dagger;The risk of malignancy in this category (less than 1%) is substantially less than that in a baseline CT scan of an asymptomatic smoker. <br />
&Dagger;Nonsolid (ground-glass) or partly solid nodules may require longer follow-up to exclude indolent adenocarcinoma.</p>
<p>These recommendations apply only to adult patients with nodules that are "incidental" in the sense that they are unrelated to known underlying disease. The following examples describe patients for whom the above guidelines would not apply:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients known to have or suspected of having malignant disease. Patients with a cancer that may be a cause of lung metastases should be cared for according to the relevant protocol or specific clinical situation. </li>
    <li>Young patients. Primary lung cancer is rare in persons under 35 years of age (less than 1% of all cases), and the risks from radiation exposure are greater than in the older population. Therefore, unless there is a known primary cancer, multiple follow-up CT studies for small incidentally detected nodules should be avoided in young patients. </li>
    <li>Patients with unexplained fever. In certain clinical settings, such a patient presenting with neutropenic fever, the presence of a nodule may indicate active infection, and short-term imaging follow-up or intervention may be appropriate. </li>
</ul>
<p>Previous CT scans, chest radiographs, and other pertinent imaging studies should be obtained for comparison whenever possible, as they may serve to demonstrate either stability or interval growth of the nodule in question.</p>
<p>A low-dose, thin-section, unenhanced technique should be used, with limited longitudinal coverage, when follow-up of a lung nodule is the only indication for the CT examination (MacMahon et al., 2005).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
The use of medical imaging has resulted in revolutionary advances in the practice of medicine. The increased sophistication and clinical efficacy of imaging have resulted in its considerable growth. Consequently, the evolution of imaging has resulted in a significant increase in the population's cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation and a potential increase in adverse effects including cancer (Amis, Butler, &amp; American College of Radiology [ACR], 2010; Amis et al., 2007). Although experts may not agree on the extent of the risks of cancer from medical imaging, there is uniform agreement that care should be taken to weigh the medical necessity of a given level of radiation exposure against the risks, and that steps should be taken to eliminate avoidable exposure to radiation (Amis et al., 2007; Center for Devices and Radiological Health [CDRH], 2010).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">High Impact Topic Area</span><br />
This topic was chosen for measure development because of the high costs associated with imaging studies and because these medical procedures are a significant source of radiation exposure. The following objective data support the degree of increase in the use of imaging studies and emphasize the importance in taking steps to help eliminate avoidable exposure.</p>
<p><em>Prevalence and Incidence</em> </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The average per capita exposure to ionizing radiation from imaging exams increased by about 600% from 1980 to 2006 in the United States (U.S.) (Mettler et al., 2009; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements [NCRP], 2009). </li>
    <li>The largest contributor to this dramatic increase in population radiation exposure is computed tomography (CT). In 1980 fewer than 3 million CT scans were performed; in 2006, there were about 380 million radiologic procedures (including 67 million CT scans) and 18 million nuclear medicine procedures performed in the U.S. (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>The imaging study with the single highest radiation burden, accounting for 22% of cumulative effective dose, is myocardial perfusion imaging (Fazel et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, an estimated 19 million head, 10.6 million chest and 21.2 million abdominal and pelvic CT scans were performed accounting for 28%, 15.9%, and 31.7%, respectively, of the total number of CT scans in the U.S. (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>Currently, approximately 11% of CT examinations are performed on children, which could account for more than 7 million pediatric CT examinations per year in the U.S. (Mettler et al., 2000; Frush &amp; Applegate, 2004; Linton, Mettler, &amp; NCRP, 2003). </li>
    <li>The prevalence of CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use during emergency department (ED) visits for injury-related conditions increased from 6% in 1998 to 15% in 2007 (Korley, Pham, &amp; Kirsch, 2010). </li>
    <li>While CT utilization has decreased steadily since 2003 in pediatric facilities across North America (Townsend et al., 2010) the use of CT in children who visit the ED increased from 0.33 to 1.65 from 1995 to 2008 and occurred primarily at non-pediatric focused facilities (Larson et al., 2011). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Costs</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 2000 through 2006, total Medicare expenditures for physician imaging services increased from $6.7 billion to about $14 billion, an increase of 13% per year on average (U.S. Government Accountability Office [GAO], 2008). </li>
    <li>In 2005 imaging services represented an estimated 14% of 2005 spending included in the sustainable growth rate (SGR) calculation, but represented 27% of the total increase in such spending between 2004 and 2005. The majority of the growth occurred for advanced imaging (GAO, 2008). </li>
    <li>In 2006, advanced imaging, including CT and MRI, accounted for 54% of total Medicare imaging expenditures, up from 43% in 2000. This translates to an increase in Medicare spending on advanced imaging from about $3 billion in 2000 to about $7.6 billion in 2006 (GAO, 2008). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disparities</em> <br />
There is variation according to age, sex, and health care market in the proportion and mean dose of patients undergoing medical imaging procedures. One study concluded that the proportion of subjects undergoing at least one imaging procedure was higher in older patients, rising from 49.5% of those who were 18 to 34 years old to 85.9% of those who were 60 to 64 years old. The study also found that women underwent procedures significantly more often than men, with a total of 78.7% of women undergoing at least one procedure during the study period, as compared with 57.9% of men (Fazel et al., 2009).</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
One retrospective cross-sectional study describing radiation dose associated with some of the most common types of diagnostic CT found variable radiation doses. The study found variability in the following exams: 1) routine chest exam without contrast, the CT effective doses ranged from 2 mSv to 24 mSv; 2) routine abdomen-pelvis, no contrast - CT effective dose ranged from 3 mSv to 43 mSv; 3) routine head exam - CT effective dose ranging from 0.3 mSv to 6 mSv (Smith-Bindman et al., 2009).</p>
<p>A central database established for collecting dose indices as a function of patient qualities (i.e., gender, age, size, etc.) and exam type (i.e., lateral lumbar spine, pelvis CT, etc.), would allow the relative range of radiation dose indices to be analyzed and compared against established benchmarks.</p>
<p>Pulmonary nodules have been identified in 8% up to 51% of individuals at the time of baseline low-dose CT screening (Gould et al., 2007; Benjamin et al., 2003). Compared with larger nodules, nodules that measure less than 8 to 10 mm in diameter are much less likely to be malignant and typically defy accurate characterization by imaging tests (Gould et al., 2007).</p>
<p>One study found no cancer in patients in whom the largest noncalcified nodule detected at initial CT was less than 5.0 mm in diameter. Thus there was no advantage in performing short-interval follow-up for nodules smaller than 5 mm in their study, even in high-risk patients (Henschke et al., 2004).</p>
<p>Because of the high frequency with which small pulmonary nodules are detected by CT, the number of resultant follow-up scans is a substantial source of patient anxiety, radiation exposure, and medical cost (Benjamin et al., 2003).</p></div>
