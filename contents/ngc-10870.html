<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Literature Review and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>A systematic literature search was completed for relevant evidence in MEDLINE using both OvidSP and PubMed (January 1, 1992, to October 31, 2012). The search strategy included medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words to capture the general concepts of pathology and quality (e.g., pathology, surgical; pathology, clinical; pathology and quality improvement; quality assurance, health care; quality control; reproducibility of results), and a targeted concept of slide/case review. MEDLINE searches were supplemented with a search of Google Scholar, a search for meeting abstracts (2008&ndash;2012) using both Biosis Previews and hand searching, and a focused hand search of identified pathology journals (2008&ndash;2012). An update of the OvidSP search was conducted through October 2013. All searches were limited to human studies published in English. Reference lists of included articles were also reviewed for relevant reports. Detailed information regarding the literature search strategy can be found in the supplemental digital content (SDC) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eligible Study Designs</span></strong></p>
<p>All study designs were included in the initial literature search. In addition to journal articles, the search identified monographs and meeting abstracts. During evidence review, articles that did not present new evidence were excluded, including letters, commentaries, and editorials.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inclusion Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Published studies were selected for full-text review if they met each of the following criteria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>English-language articles/documents that addressed surgical pathology or cytology studies and provided data or information relevant to one or more key questions; and </li>
    <li>Original research addressing pathology case reviews</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exclusion Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Editorials, letters, commentaries, and invited opinions were not included in the study. Articles were also excluded if the full article was not available in English, did not address any key questions, and/or focused primarily on clinical pathology studies, including all other specialties except radiology. Articles were also excluded if they were focused on any of the following: preanalytic specimen processes, noninterpretative postanalytic processes, additional diagnostic techniques, issues related to competency use of checklists, standardized language, taxonomy, or formatting.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results</span></strong></p>
<p>A total of 823 studies met the search term requirements. A total of 137 articles were included for data extraction.</p>
<p>For further details on the literature search, including MeSH terms and keywords, see the SDC (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Management</span></strong></p>
<p>The data elements from an included article/document were extracted by one reviewer into standard data formats and tables developed using systematic review database software (DistillerSR, Evidence Partners Inc., Ottawa, Canada); a second reviewer confirmed accuracy and completeness. In all cases, the methodologist acted as either the primary or secondary reviewer. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved by discussion with the methodologist. A bibliographic database was established in EndNote (Thomson Reuters, Carlsbad, CA) to track all literature identified and reviewed during the study.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Rates of discrepancy and major discrepancy were described for all studies, and subgroups based on type of specimen (surgical pathology, cytopathology or both), focusing on one organ or organ system (single organ) versus multi-organ studies, and whether conducted within a single institution (internal) or reviews of cases diagnosed at a different institution (external). Studies were tested for homogeneity using Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 2.2.064. Nonparametric descriptive statistics including median, and 1st and 3rd quartiles were calculated using Excel.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach provides a system for rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations that is explicit, comprehensive, transparent, and pragmatic, and is increasingly being adopted by organizations worldwide. The GRADE approach examines the quality of evidence at the level of individual studies and also at the review level. GRADE was used for rating the quality of evidence. At the individual study level, the panel assessed studies according to three criteria: (1) study design rating, (2) risk of bias rating, and (3) applicability concerns. A physician-methodologist consultant experienced in systematic review and guideline development rated the quality of each study, constructed evidence tables and summary of findings tables, and, along with the panel, developed quality of evidence ratings. The quality of evidence definitions from GRADE are shown (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The College of American Pathologists (CAP) Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center (the Center) and the Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology (ADASP) convened an expert panel consisting of practicing pathologists with expertise and experience in surgical pathology. Members included practicing pathologists in the United States and Canada. The CAP and ADASP approved the appointment of the project, cochairs, and expert panel members. In addition, a physician-methodologist experienced in systematic review and guideline development consulted with the panel throughout the project.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessing the Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Development of recommendations requires that the panel review the identified evidence and make a series of key judgments using procedures described in the supplemental digital content (SDC) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). CAP uses a three-tier system to rate the strength of recommendations instead of the traditional two-tier approach of strong or weak recommendations. This approach is consistent with prior CAP guidelines (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results</span></strong></p>
<p>The panel convened 26 times (25 by teleconference and 1 face-to-face meeting) to develop the scope, draft recommendations, review and respond to solicited feedback, and assess the quality of evidence that supports the final recommendations. A nominal group technique was employed by the panel for consensus decision-making to encourage unique input with balanced participation among group members. An open comment period was held from December 2, 2013, through January 21, 2014, during which draft recommendations were posted on the CAP Web site. Five recommendations were drafted, with strong agreement for each recommendation from the open comment period participants ranging from 87% to 93% (refer to "Outcomes" section in the SDC for full details). The expert panel modified the draft recommendations based on the feedback given during the considered judgment process.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the methods and systematic review used for this guideline can be found in the SDC.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The College of American Pathologists (CAP) developed the Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center as a forum to create and maintain evidence-based practice guidelines and consensus statements. Practice guidelines and consensus statements reflect the best available evidence and expert consensus supported in practice. They are intended to assist physicians and patients in clinical decision-making and to identify questions and settings for further research. With the rapid flow of scientific information, new evidence may emerge between the time a practice guideline or consensus statement is developed and when it is published or read. Guidelines and statements are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. Guidelines and statements address only the topics specifically identified therein and are not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. Furthermore, guidelines and consensus statements cannot account for individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other health care provider, relying on independent experience and knowledge, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to any practice guideline or consensus statement is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances and preferences. CAP and the Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology (ADASP) make no warranty, express or implied, regarding guidelines and statements, and specifically exclude any warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular use or purpose. CAP and ADASP assume no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this statement or for any errors or omissions. </li>
    <li>Because secondary review of cases detects and corrects errors, it is natural to wonder whether these data can be used to measure quality in an anatomic pathology laboratory. Such a measure would be of tremendous interest to pathologists, clinicians, employers, insurers, and patients. However, at present it is not clear how best to interpret the results of these reviews appropriately, and these results should not be used to attempt to compare the quality of two different pathology laboratories. </li>
    <li>The recommendations should be tailored to the needs of the individual laboratory. </li>
</ul>

Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Prior to acceptance on the expert panel, potential members completed the College of American Pathologists (CAP) conflict of interest disclosure process, whose policy and form require disclosure of material financial interest in, or potential for benefit of significant value from, the guideline's development or its recommendations. The potential members completed the conflict of interest disclosure form, listing any relationship that could be interpreted as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent conflict. Potential conflicts were managed by the cochairs. Everyone was required to disclose conflicts prior to beginning and continuously throughout the project's timeline. Disclosed conflicts of the expert panel members are listed in the appendix of the original guideline document. Please see the supplemental digital content (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for full details on the conflict of interest policy.</p></div>
