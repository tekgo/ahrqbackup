Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C who have received at least one injection of hepatitis A vaccine or who have documented immunity to hepatitis A.</p>
<p>This measure is paired with <a href="/content.aspx?id=49643" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Hepatitis C: percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C who have received at least one injection of hepatitis B vaccine or who have documented immunity to hepatitis B</a>. Implementers of this measure should not use this measure without the hepatitis B vaccination measure.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The hepatitis A vaccination decreases the potential for a patient acquiring hepatitis A which would contribute to further liver damage. A single report has suggested that superimposition of hepatitis A virus infection in persons with chronic liver disease, particularly those with hepatitis C, was associated with fulminant hepatitis. Therefore, it is recommended that persons with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who lack evidence of preexisting antibody to hepatitis A be administered the hepatitis A vaccine. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>: </p>
<p>All persons with chronic HCV infection who lack antibodies to hepatitis A and B should be offered vaccination against these two viral infections (Ghany et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Patients with chronic hepatitis C should be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) (European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2011).</p></div>
