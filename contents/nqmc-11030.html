Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of in-hospital deaths per 1,000 discharges with pancreatic resection for cancer, ages 18 years and older.</p>
<p>The indicator is presented in two strata based on the presence or absence of pancreatic cancer diagnosis. This measure summary represents the overall rate. See also the "Basis for Disaggregation" field.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Pancreatic resection is a rare procedure that requires technical proficiency, and errors in surgical technique or management may lead to clinically significant complications, such as sepsis, anastomotic breakdown, and death. Better processes of care may reduce mortality for pancreatic resection, which represents better quality care.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Contains 30 million adult discharges and 4,000 hospitals ("Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [HCUP] State Inpatient Databases [SID]," 2008). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. The developer's metric of reliability is the signal to noise ratio. The signal to noise ratio is the ratio of the between hospital variance (signal) to the within hospital variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). The ratio itself is only a diagnostic for the degree of variance in the risk-adjusted rate systematically associated with the provider. Therefore, what matters is the magnitude of the variance in the "smoothed" rate (that is, the variance in the risk-adjusted rate after the application of the univariate shrinkage estimator based on the signal ratio).</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. Updated testing results including both benign and malignant cases:</p>
<p>What the data demonstrate is systematic variation in the provider level rate of 10.2 to 85.6 per 1,000 from the 5th to 95th percentile after a signal ratio of 0.549 is applied as the shrinkage estimator (that is, after accounting for variation due to random factors). (The signal ratio for benign cases only is 0.451 and for malignant cases only is 0.350.)</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. One-hundred percent national analytic files from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the calendar years 2003 through 2006 were used. Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) files, which contain hospital discharge abstracts for all fee-for-service acute care hospitalizations of all U.S. Medicare recipients, were used to create the main analytical datasets. The Medicare denominator file was used to assess patient vital status at 30 days. Using appropriate procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, version 9 (ICD-9 codes), all patients aged 65 to 99 undergoing pancreatectomy were identified (Dimick, Staiger, &amp; Birkmeyer, 2010).</p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. The developer first estimated risk-adjusted hospital mortality rates during 2003 to 2004. Mortality was defined as death within 30 days of operation or before hospital discharge. The developer adjusted for patient age, gender, race, urgency of operation, median ZIP-code income, and coexisting medical conditions. Using logistic regression, they estimated the expected number of deaths in each hospital and then divided the observed deaths by this expected number of deaths to obtain the ratio of observed to expected mortality (O/E) ratio. The developer then multiplied the O/E ratio by the average mortality rate to obtain a risk-adjusted mortality rate for each hospital. Next hierarchical modeling techniques were used to adjust these mortality estimates for reliability. Using random effects logistic regression models, empirical Bayes predictions of mortality for each hospital were generated (Dimick, Staiger, &amp; Birkmeyer, 2010). </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. In assessing the ability of hospital mortality rankings to predict future performance, reliability adjustment was particularly important for pancreatic resection and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, hospital rankings based on reliability-adjusted mortality were superior at identifying hospitals likely to have the lowest future mortality. Without reliability adjustment, hospitals in the "best" quintile (2003 to 2004) with pancreatic resection had a mortality of 7.6 percent in 2005 to 2006; with reliability adjustment, the "best" hospital quintile had a mortality of 2.7 percent in 2003 to 2006 (Dimick, Staiger, &amp; Birkmeyer, 2010).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The predicted value for each case is computed using a hierarchical model (logistic regression with hospital random effect) and covariates for gender, age in years (in 5-year age groups), All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Group (APR-DRG) and APR-DRG risk of-mortality subclass. The reference population used in the model is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) for the year 2008 (updated annually), a database consisting of 43 states and approximately 30 million adult discharges. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., hospital). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population rate.</p>
