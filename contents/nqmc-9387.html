<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) defines induction of labour as "the artificial initiation of labour before its spontaneous onset for the purpose of delivery of the fetoplacetal unit" (Crane, 2001). At term (37+0/7 to 41+0/7 weeks), induction may be chosen over expectant management due to a variety of maternal and/or fetal medical indications (e.g., maternal diabetes, fetal intrauterine growth restriction); conditions for which the benefits of the onset of labour are thought to outweigh the potential risks posed by induction (Caughey et al., 2009). Induction in the absence of a medical indication is termed elective and the benefits, harms and costs of elective induction continue to be debated in the literature (Caughey et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding elective induction, its use continues to grow and appears to be increasing at a rate faster than inductions as a whole (Caughey et al., 2009).</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>

</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is a lack of quality evidence on the benefits and harms of elective induction among women less than 41 weeks gestation. Two systematic reviews assessing elective induction at (or post) term, were limited in drawing conclusions as most studies evaluated women greater than or equal to 41 weeks gestation. </li>
    <li>Modeling of the economic and health consequences of elective induction between 39 and 41 weeks suggest induction to be associated with higher costs and rates of cesarean delivery. Expenditures are particularly pronounced among nulliparous women of younger gestational age with unfavorable cervixes. </li>
    <li>Two recently published studies have successfully implemented quality improvement initiatives that have led to reductions in rates of induction over time. Despite the inherent limitations in their observational designs, these studies present promising findings for similar hospital-based initiatives. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <em>What is Known About the Maternal and Newborn Risks of Elective Induction of Women at Term?</em> for a summary of the evidence around the risks and benefits to mothers and newborns subsequent to induction at term when there is no medical indication to do so. The report's intention is to support efforts that seek to reduce rates of unnecessary induction among women who give birth in Ontario.</p>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>To validate the seven potential indicators as being appropriate for use throughout the province, the authors first extracted data from the BORN Information System (BIS) for fiscal year 2009 to 2010 to assess historical and current performance on these indicators across Ontario's 14 health regions (Local Health Integration Networks). Simultaneously, evidence summaries on each of the potential indicators were developed in collaboration with the Knowledge to Action Research Centre at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Thielman et al., 2011; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What are the drivers," 2010; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What are the maternal," 2011; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What is known," 2011; Khangura, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, 2010). This group, which has expertise in the review and synthesis of literature to support evidence-informed health care decision-making, assisted with determining the level of scientific evidence to support each indicator. For example, the evidence summary on early term repeat Caesarean section (i.e., before 39 weeks' gestation) in a defined population determined that as a result of this practice there were indeed objective risks to babies that could be reduced by delaying delivery.</p>
<p>Following review of the data and evidence summaries, the committee removed one indicator and refined some of the others, leaving six. In five of the six, the potential for improvement in rates was obvious. The remaining indicator (rate of screening for group B streptococcus) is currently satisfactory throughout all health regions of the province; however, the committee felt it was important at the outset to have the dashboard reflect not only performance areas requiring improvement, but also areas in which performance was good.</p></div>
