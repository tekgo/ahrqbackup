Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is one component of a three-part survey measure that assesses different facets of providing medical assistance with smoking and tobacco cessation. This measure uses survey data to assess the percentage of members 18 years of age and older who were current smokers or tobacco users and who received advice to quit smoking during the measurement year.</p>
<p>This measure is collected as part of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version (commercial, Medicaid) or by Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) using the Medicare CAHPS Survey (Medicare).</p>
<p>See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summaries of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measures:</p>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Smoking and tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States (U.S.), causing more than 430,700 deaths each year. Over 47 million Americans smoke or use tobacco, despite the risks. Seventy percent of smokers are interested in stopping smoking completely; smokers report that they would be more likely to stop smoking if a doctor advised them to quit (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2005). A number of clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of clinical quit-smoking programs. Getting even brief advice to quit is associated with a 30 percent increase in the number of people who quit (Fiore et al., 2000).</p>
<p>Specifications for this measure are consistent with current United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2003) recommendations. Quitting smoking reduces the risk of lung and other cancers, heart attack, stroke and chronic lung disease. Women who stop smoking before pregnancy or during the first three months of pregnancy reduce their risk of having a low-birth-weight baby to the same risk as women who never smoked. The excess risk of coronary artery disease is reduced by about half one year after quitting, and continues to decline gradually (USPSTF, 2003).</p>
<p>Smokers who quit before age 45 are likely to avoid 54 percent to 67 percent of expected lifetime economic losses due to smoking, and those over 70 are likely to avoid 32 percent to 52 percent of such costs. Evidence suggests that tracking smoking status as a "vital sign" leads to more aggressive counseling and higher quit rates.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Smoking and tobacco use are the largest causes of preventable disease and death in the United States (U.S). Tobacco use causes disease in nearly every organ in the body (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [HHS], 2014). </li>
    <li>The U.S. spends more than $133 billion each year in direct medical care due to diseases caused by tobacco use. Indirect costs from lost productivity total more than $156 billion each year (HHS, 2014). </li>
    <li>Smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths in the U.S each year&mdash;41,000 deaths are caused by secondhand smoke (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014). </li>
    <li>Smoking has killed more than 20 million Americans in the past 50 years (HHS, 2014). </li>
    <li>Approximately 42 million adults classified themselves as a smoker in 2012 (HHS, 2014). </li>
    <li>Quitting smoking and tobacco use can save lives and improve overall health. Comprehensive cessation interventions that motivate and help users to quit tobacco use can be very effective (CDC, 2014). Health care providers play an important role in supporting tobacco users and their efforts to quit. </li>
