<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, who undergo a procedure under anesthesia and are admitted to an intensive care unit&nbsp;(ICU) directly from the anesthetizing location, who have a documented use of a checklist or protocol for the transfer of care from the responsible anesthesia practitioner to the responsible ICU team or team member.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2015) found that "current signout mechanisms are generally ad-hoc, varying from hospital to hospital and unit to unit". According to data published by the Joint Commission, communication errors were indicated in 59% of reported sentinel events in 2012 and in 54% of operative/postoperative complications between 2004 and 2012. A 2006 survey among residents at Massachusetts General Hospital found that 59% of respondents reported one or more patients experiencing harm as a result of ineffective patient handoff practices during their most recent clinical rotation (Kitch et al., 2008). Therefore, a standardized transfer of care protocol or handoff tool/checklist that is utilized for all patients directly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after undergoing a procedure under the care of an anesthesia practitioner will facilitate effective communications between the medical practitioner who provided anesthesia during the procedure and the care practitioner in the ICU who is responsible for post-procedural care. This should minimize errors and oversights in medical care of ICU patients after procedures. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Quality Forum, in its <em>Preferred Practices and Performance Measures for Measuring and Reporting Care Coordination</em> report (2010), recommends:</p>
<p>Preferred Practice 23: Healthcare providers and healthcare organizations should implement protocols and policies for a standardized approach to all transitions of care. Policies and procedures related to transitions and the critical aspects should be included in the standardized approach.</p></div>
