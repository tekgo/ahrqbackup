Major Recommendations

<div class="content_para"><p>Strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Weak</strong>) and quality of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low, Very Low</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health question: What prophylactic interventions are effective at preventing or reducing the severity of oral and oropharyngeal mucositis in children (0&ndash;18 years) receiving treatment for cancer or undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: The Guideline Development Group suggests that cryotherapy may be offered to cooperative children receiving chemotherapy or HSCT conditioning with regimens associated with a high rate of mucositis. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, Moderate Quality Evidence</strong>)<br />
    <em>Remarks</em>: This recommendation places high value on the possible reduction in mucositis with an intervention with a low risk of harm. It is a weak recommendation because of the lack of paediatric-specific evidence, because the majority of studies that demonstrated the benefit of cryotherapy were conducted using chemotherapy regimens not commonly given to children and because of the methodological limitations of the conducted trials. Regimens appropriate for cryotherapy are restricted to agents with a short infusion time and a short half-life. </li>
    <li><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: The Guideline Development Group suggests that low-level light therapy may be offered to cooperative children receiving chemotherapy or HSCT conditioning with regimens associated with a high rate of mucositis. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, High Quality Evidence</strong>)<br />
    <em>Remarks</em>: This recommendation places high value on the possible reduction in mucositis with an intervention with a low risk of harm. It is a weak recommendation because this strategy requires specialised equipment and expertise and it is unknown whether it is feasible to deliver this therapy modality in routine clinical practice, particularly in a paediatric population. The ideal treatment parameters and cost-effectiveness of this approach are unknown. </li>
    <li><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: The Guideline Development Group suggests that keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) may be offered to children receiving HSCT conditioning with regimens associated with a high rate of severe mucositis. (<strong>Weak Recommendation, High Quality Evidence</strong>)<br />
    <em>Remarks</em>: This recommendation places high value on the evidence of efficacy of KGF in adult populations. It is a weak recommendation because of the lack of efficacy and toxicity data in children, a theoretical concern that young children may be at increased risk of adverse effects related to mucosal thickening and the lack of long-term follow-up data in paediatric cancers. </li>

<p>The following databases were searched and included articles indexed as of April 1, 2014: Ovid in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews &ndash; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.</p>
<p><strong>Selection Criteria and Appraisal</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of the publications identified by the search strategy. Any publication considered potentially relevant by either reviewer was retrieved in full and assessed for eligibility. Inclusion of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of both reviewers. The Guideline Development Group included fully-published papers that were RCTs or quasi-RCTs of cryotherapy for the prevention of mucositis in patients receiving treatment for cancer or undergoing HSCT. There was no restriction by language. Two reviewers compiled the evidence summary table.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Randomized Controlled Trials of Low Level Light Therapy (LLLT)</span></strong></p>
<p>A systematic review of RCTs evaluating LLLT to prevent mucositis in adults and children was recently published.</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The following databases were searched and included articles indexed as of February 17, 2014: Ovid in MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews &ndash; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, SCOPUS and LILACS. The search strategies may be found in Oberoi et al. (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Selection Criteria and Appraisal</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of publications identified by the search strategy. Any publication considered potentially relevant by either reviewer was retrieved in full and assessed for eligibility. Inclusion of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of both reviewers. Studies were included if the population consisted of patients with cancer or undergoing HSCT and patients were randomly assigned to receive prophylactic LLLT versus placebo, no therapy or usual care. Studies were excluded if: (1) allocation not randomly assigned; (2) absence of a placebo or no treatment group; (3) randomized chemotherapy cycles or left and right buccal mucosa within a patient rather than randomizing patients (as episodes would not be independent); and (4) duplicate publication. Studies included in the meta-analysis were not restricted by language or publication status.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Synthesis</span></strong></p>
<p>For all systematic reviews, the Guideline Development Group synthesised the occurrence of severe oral mucositis when at least three studies reported on this outcome for a specific intervention. Severe oral mucositis was defined as World Health Organization (WHO), National Cancer Institute&mdash;Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) V.2.0 or Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale score of 3 or 4. All these scores use a five-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 in which scores of 3 and 4 represent the worst mucositis. The NCI-CTCAE V.3.0 scale ranges from 1 to 5, in which 5 is fatal mucositis. NCI-CTCAE V.3.0 scores of 3&ndash;5 were considered severe. All syntheses used the risk ratio (RR) as the effect measure where ratios less than 1 suggest that the intervention is better than placebo or no therapy. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was also described. As they anticipated heterogeneity across studies, a random effects model was used for all analyses. Analyses were conducted using Review Manager (RevMan, V.5.2, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Question</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline sought to answer the following health question:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What prophylactic interventions are effective at preventing or reducing the severity of oral and oropharyngeal mucositis in children (0 to 18 years) receiving treatment for cancer or undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Panel</span></strong></p>
<p>The Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario (POGO) Mucositis Prevention Guideline Development Group was formed in March 2014 (see online supplementary appendix 1 [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Members were selected with a view to obtain interdisciplinary representation from internationally recognised experts in paediatric mucositis and POGO institutions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decision-Making Process for Formulation of the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group identified outcomes most important for this guideline. Outcomes of critical importance were severe oral mucositis, mucositis of any severity, pain and adverse events associated with the intervention. Outcomes of lower importance included receipt of opioid analgesia, enteral or parenteral nutrition, infection outcomes and fever, since these outcomes are subject to confounding and institutional variation.</p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to describe quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Quality of evidence was evaluated in terms of risk of bias (methodological limitations), imprecision of estimates, inconsistency of results between studies and indirectness (lack of applicability to the target population). In this guideline, indirectness primarily occurred when the data were not paediatric specific. A strong recommendation was made when benefits clearly outweighed the risks and burdens or vice versa. In contrast, a weak recommendation was made when benefits and risks or burdens were closely matched, or when there was considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the benefits and risks. Each recommendation was carefully deliberated by the panel. Decisions were taken through panel discussions and any differences in opinion were resolved by consensus.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There are two safety considerations with cryotherapy. First, if ice chips are to be used, they may be a choking hazard in very young children, although children who are old enough to comply with cryotherapy are unlikely to be at risk for choking. Second, vasoconstriction of the oral tissues may influence local anticancer activity, although this issue has not been noted in the adult studies. </li>
    <li>In the eight studies reporting that keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) significantly reduced severe oral mucositis, primary toxicities were related to the pharmacological properties of the agent with thickening of the oral mucosa and altered taste sensation. In an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) study, toxicities reported included skin rash, skin erythema, altered taste and severe pain in the tongue, buccal mucosa and palate. A case report described a 19-year-old patient who received KGF 60 &mu;g/kg/day for 3 days before and after allogeneic HSCT. He developed transient non-severe hyperplastic gingivitis with a concomitant papulopustular skin rash. </li>

<p>Clinical assessment for the presence and severity of oral mucositis should be a component of routine care for children receiving treatment for cancer and undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Validated screening and assessment tools are important. A screening tool that includes mucositis has been developed but has not yet been validated. Validated mucositis assessment tools in paediatric patients include the Children's International Mucositis Evaluation Scale (ChIMES), the Oral Assessment Guide, the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale and the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire.</p>
<p>In this guideline, the Guideline Development Group identified three interventions that may be appropriate for mucositis prevention in children. Figure 3 (see the original guideline document) illustrates an algorithm for strategy implementation consideration. All three specific interventions (cryotherapy, low-level light therapy [LLLT] and keratinocyte growth factor [KGF]) evaluated in this clinical practice guideline were associated with a weak recommendation for use. Since all systematic reviews compared the intervention against placebo or no therapy, it may be helpful to compare the risk ratios (RRs) to gain insight into prioritisation. The RR against placebo or no therapy for LLLT, cryotherapy and KGF were 0.37, 0.46 and 0.81, respectively. In evaluating all three interventions, KGF is an intervention associated with high costs and a potential for harm. In contrast, cryotherapy is associated with very few costs and little risk of harm. On balance, if all three interventions are available, and clinically relevant, cryotherapy or LLLT should likely be prioritised for implementation whereas KGF should be used carefully in individual patients after weighing risks and benefits. There may also be important organizational and cost barriers to the adoption of LLLT since it requires specialised equipment and training for those who will administer therapy.</p>
<p>Dissemination of this guideline will be an important step in effective knowledge translation. The Guideline Development Group plans to disseminate this guideline through peer-reviewed publication, presentation at conferences and through paediatric oncology and dental organisations.</p></div>
