Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The following taxanes regimens are recommend for women with:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Anthracycline-na&iuml;ve, tumours do not overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2</strong>.
    <p>If single-agent chemotherapy is preferred, sequential anthracycline followed by taxane at the time of disease progression, or vice versa, are acceptable alternatives. A survival benefit has not been shown for starting with a taxane.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>An every 3-week (q3w) regimen of docetaxel 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> is recommended. </li>
        <li>The following weekly taxane regimens are reasonable options if reduced risk of toxicities is desired:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Docetaxel 35&ndash;40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly, x3 every 4 weeks (q4w) or weekly, x6 every 8 weeks (q8w) </li>
            <li>Paclitaxel 80&ndash;90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If combination chemotherapy is preferred, non-taxane/anthracycline and taxane/anthracycline regimens are acceptable alternatives. Taxane/anthracycline combinations are superior with respect to overall response and progression-free survival (PFS), but have not been shown to improve overall survival (OS). Additionally, an OS benefit for using a taxane/anthracycline combination over planned sequential single-agent anthracycline followed by single-agent taxane (before disease progression), or at the time of disease progression has not been shown.</p>
    <p>Regarding possible taxane/anthracycline regimens, doublet docetaxel or paclitaxel plus doxorubicin or epirubicin, and triplet docetaxel + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide have been studied.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Anthracycline pretreated/resistant, tumours do not overexpress HER2</strong>.
    <p>If single-agent chemotherapy is preferred, a taxane regimen is recommended. Single-agent taxanes appear to improve OS and response compared with non-taxane/non-anthracycline regimens.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>An every 3-week regimen of docetaxel 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> is recommended. </li>
        <li>The following weekly taxane regimens are reasonable options if reduced risk of toxicities is desired:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Docetaxel 35&ndash;40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly, x3 q4w or weekly, x6 q8w </li>
            <li>Paclitaxel 80&ndash;90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If combination chemotherapy is preferred, taxane/non-anthracycline regimens are recommended. Taxane/non-anthracycline regimens are superior with respect to OS and response compared with single-agent taxanes. Definitive survival data with taxane/non-anthracycline combinations compared with sequential single-agent taxane followed by single-agent non-taxane/non-anthracycline (at progression) is not available.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The following taxane/non-anthracycline regimens should be options:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 + capecitabine 1,250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, twice daily (b.i.d), days 1&ndash;14, q3w </li>
            <li>Docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 + gemcitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 &amp; 8, q3w </li>
            <li>Paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 + gemcitabine 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 &amp; 8, q3w </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Anthracycline-na&iuml;ve or pretreated/resistant with HER2 over-expression</strong>.
    <p>A taxane/trastuzumab combination is recommended up front. The addition of trastuzumab to a taxane has been shown to improve OS and response. Although the addition of trastuzumab to anthracycline regimens has also been shown to improve OS and response, the incidence of cardiac failure is unacceptable. The addition of carboplatin to taxane/trastuzumab combinations has not yet been shown to improve OS or consistently increase response.</p>
    <p>The strongest evidence is for the following single-agent taxane regimens plus weekly trastuzumab:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Docetaxel 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q3w </li>
        <li>Paclitaxel 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q3w </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Anthracycline-na&iuml;ve or pretreated/resistant AND paclitaxel or docetaxel intolerance</strong>.
    <p>For patients with intolerance to paclitaxel or docetaxel caused by a severe infusion reaction or severe toxicity from previous administration of a taxane, including corticosteroid intolerance, the following single-agent nab-paclitaxel regimens should be options:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Nab-paclitaxel 260&ndash;300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q3w </li>
        <li>Nab-paclitaxel 100&ndash;150 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly, x3 q4w </li>
    </ul>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was originally developed in December 2007 using the ADAPTE process and some aspects of the Practice Guidelines Development Cycle. The Comprehensive Meta-analysis Package Version 2 was used for data pooling where deemed appropriate. Random effects models were used to obtain odds ratios (OR) or rate ratios. This guideline was revised in December 2009 and September 2013.</p>
<p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Breast Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Trust Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Breast Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
