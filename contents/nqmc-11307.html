<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level, 30-day risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) for patients discharged from the hospital following isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Mortality is defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the procedure date. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Outcome measures can focus attention on a broad set of healthcare activities that affect patients' well-being. Moreover, improving patient outcomes is the ultimate goal of quality improvement, so outcomes are a direct measure of success in quality improvement. Two statutes direct the Department of Health and Human Services to develop outcomes measures. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005 mandated that the Secretary of Health and Human Services publicly report quality measures that include measures of hospital outcomes and efficiency under the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program (formerly the Reporting Hospital Quality Data for Annual Payment Update Program). In addition, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 promotes the further development and use of outcomes measures. </p>
<p>The goal of outcomes measurement is to evaluate patient outcomes after accounting for patients' conditions at the time of hospital admission (hospital case-mix). This mortality measure was developed to identify hospitals that perform better or worse than would be expected based on their patient case-mix, and therefore to promote hospital quality improvement and better inform consumers about quality of care.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a priority area for outcomes measure development because it is a common procedure associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care spending. In 2007, there were 114,028 hospitalizations for CABG surgery and 137,721 hospitalizations for combined surgeries for CABG and valve procedures ("CABG plus valve" surgeries) among Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) patients in the United States (Drye et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>CABG surgeries are costly procedures that account for the majority of major cardiac surgeries performed nationally. In fiscal year 2009, isolated CABG surgeries accounted for almost half (47.6%) of all cardiac surgery hospital admissions in Massachusetts (Massachusetts Data Analysis Center, 2011). In 2008, the average Medicare payment was $30,546 for CABG without valve and $47,669 for CABG plus valve surgeries (Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council [PCH4], 2011). </li>
    <li>Mortality rates following CABG surgery vary across hospitals. The unadjusted mean hospital mortality rate in the January 2009 to September 2011 sample of Medicare FFS patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery is 3.7% and ranges from 0% to 100% with a median of 2.9% (25th and 75th percentiles are 1.5% and 4.8%, respectively). The variation persists after risk adjustment. The mean risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) is 3.3% with a range from 1.5% to 9.3%. The median risk-standardized mortality rate is 3.1% (25th and 75th percentiles are 2.7% and 3.7%, respectively). Similarly, published data also demonstrate variation in mortality rates. The observed operative (i.e., in-hospital or within 30-days of surgery) all-cause, hospital-level mortality rate was 1.81% and ranged from 0.0% to 5.6% among patients who were discharged after CABG surgery (without any other major heart surgery) in New York in 2008 (New York State Department of Health, 2010). </li>

Extent of Measure Testing

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Model</strong></p>
<p>The coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery mortality measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized mortality rates (RSMRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the model using the July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 public reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year. </p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero.</p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.2 of the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><strong>CABG Surgery Mortality 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of CABG Surgery Model Variables</em> </p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>An increase in Renal failure (27.6% to 29.7%) </li>
    <li>Decreases in Angina; old myocardial infarction (42.4% to 37.7%) and Unstable angina and other acute ischemic heart disease (42.3% to 35.7%) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>CABG Surgery Model Parameters and Performance </em></p>
<p>Table 4.2.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.2.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the CABG surgery mortality model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic increased slightly from 0.77 to 0.78.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, sex, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission. </p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. </p>
