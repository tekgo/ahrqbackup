Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of individuals 18 years of age and older who have at least one of three core risks (obesity, smoking or tobacco use, physical inactivity) and who have at least one interactive contact in a wellness and health promotion program during the program period.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Increasing the rates at which individuals with health risks participate in health promotion interventions can be critical to the success of a health promotion program. Health promotion programs are seen as a national priority, demonstrated by their inclusion in Healthy People 2020. The relevant Healthy People 2020 goals are to increase the proportion of worksites that offer an employee health promotion program to their employees and increase the proportion of employees who participate in employer-sponsored health promotion activities (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], 2016).</p>
<p>Research demonstrates that there is sufficient evidence of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of health promotion programs (Aldana, 2001; Chapman, 2005; Pelletier, 2005), and that greater participation in health promotion programs results in better health-related outcomes and lower costs (Goetzel et al., 2002; Ozminkowski et al., 2000; Serxner et al., 2003; Yen et al., 2006).</p>
<p>In addition, the Community Preventive Services Task Force (established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 1996 to identify population health interventions that are scientifically proven to save lives, increase lifespans, and improve quality of life) recommends:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>"Worksite programs intended to improve diet and/or physical activity behaviors based on strong evidence of their effectiveness for reducing weight among employees" (The Guide to Community Preventive Services, 2007) and, </li>
    <li>"Worksite-based incentives and competitions when combined with additional interventions to support individual cessation efforts based on strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing tobacco use among workers" (The Guide to Community Preventive Services, 2005). </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the evidence, participation in health promotion programs can vary by organization, over time and by type of incentive offered (Chapman, 2006; Stein, Shakour, &amp; Zuidema, 2000).</p></div>
