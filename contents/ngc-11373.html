<div class="content_para"><p>The evidence grades (<strong>A-D, X</strong>) and evidence-based statements (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Recommendation</strong> and <strong>Option,</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 1. Identification of Abnormal Voice</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should identify dysphonia in a patient with altered voice quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication or reduces quality of life (QOL).</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile: 1</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To promote awareness of dysphonia by all clinicians as a condition that may require intervention or additional investigation. National Quality Strategy domain: Prevention and Treatment of Leading Causes of Morbidity and Mortality. </li>

    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Timely recognition of the need to search for an underlying etiology; identify patients who may benefit from treatment; discourage the perception of dysphonia as a trivial condition that does not warrant attention </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Potential anxiety related to diagnosis; time expended in diagnosis, documentation, and discussion </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefits over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The group believes that this is a critical component to caring for patients with altered voice, but it was constrained from calling this a strong recommendation from a lack of A- or B-level evidence </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preference: Small </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy Level: Recommendation </li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 3. Escalation of Care</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should assess the patient with dysphonia by history and physical examination to identify factors where expedited laryngeal evaluation is indicated. These include but are not limited to recent surgical procedures involving the head, neck, or chest; recent endotracheal intubation; presence of concomitant neck mass; respiratory distress or stridor; history of tobacco abuse; and whether the patient is a professional voice user.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strong recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile: 3</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To encourage early referral of patients with dysphonia whose history, symptoms, or physical examination is concerning for a serious underlying etiology. National Quality Strategy domains: Prevention and Treatment of Leading Causes of Morbidity and Mortality; Effective Communication and Care Coordination; Patient Safety. </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: To identify factors early in the course of management that could influence the timing of diagnostic procedures, choice of interventions, or provision of follow-up care; to identify risk factors; to identify populations for whom early or more aggressive intervention may be warranted (i.e., professional voice) </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Time in assessment </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Importance of history taking and identifying modifying factors as an essential component of providing quality care </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The term <em>expedited</em> does not specify exact timing </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Moderate (small: in the setting of a neck mass with dysphonia or concern for malignancy) </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Strong recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinions: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 4A. Laryngoscopy and Dysphonia</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may perform diagnostic laryngoscopy at any time for a patient with dysphonia.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option</span></em> based on observational studies, expert opinion, and a balance of benefit and harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile: 4A</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To highlight the important role of visualizing the larynx and vocal folds in treating a patient with dysphonia. National Quality Strategy domains: Prevention and Treatment of Leading Causes of Morbidity and Mortality; Effective Communication and Care Coordination; Patient Safety. </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Establishing the underlying diagnosis, possible reduction in cost, improved diagnostic accuracy, appropriate referrals and treatment, avoidance of missed or delayed diagnosis, reduced anxiety by establishing diagnosis </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Patient discomfort, cost of examination, procedure-related morbidity </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Balance of benefit and harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Laryngoscopy is an essential tool for diagnosing the cause of dysphonia and should be available to those who can perform it; however, dysphonia is often self-limited and may resolve spontaneously without a diagnosis </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Moderate </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Option </li>
    <li>Differences of opinions: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 4B. Need for Laryngoscopy in Persistent Dysphonia</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should perform laryngoscopy, or refer to a clinician who can perform laryngoscopy, when dysphonia fails to resolve or improve within 4 weeks or irrespective of duration if a serious underlying cause is suspected.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies, expert opinion, and a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile: 4B</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To highlight the important role of visualizing the larynx and vocal folds in treating a patient with dysphonia, especially if the dysphonia fails to improve within 4 weeks' onset. National Quality Strategy domains: Prevention and Treatment of Leading Causes of Morbidity and Mortality; Effective Communication and Care Coordination. </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies on the natural history of benign laryngeal disorders; grade C for observational studies plus expert opinion on defining what constitutes a serious underlying condition </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Avoid missed or delayed diagnosis of serious conditions among patients without additional signs and/or symptoms to suggest underlying disease; permit prompt assessment of the larynx when serious concern exists </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Potential for delay in diagnosis; procedure-related morbidity; procedure-related expense; patient discomfort </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: A need exists to balance timely diagnostic intervention with the potential for overutilization and excessive cost. The guideline update panel debated the optimal time for assessment of the larynx with a consensus-based approach and agreed on 4 weeks with the option to proceed more promptly based on clinical circumstances </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The term <em>serious underlying</em> concern is subject to the discretion of the clinician. Some conditions are clearly serious, but for other patients, the seriousness of the condition is dependent on the patient. Intentional vagueness was incorporated to allow for clinical judgment in the expediency of evaluation </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: If there is a serious underlying concern, then there is a limited role for patient preference; however, among patients without a serious underlying concern, the role for patient preference is moderate </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinions: There was some disagreement about whether the time frame should be 4 or 6 weeks. After casting their votes, 10 panel members favored a 4-week time frame, and 5 favored a 6-week time frame. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 5. Imaging</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should not obtain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among patients with a primary voice complaint prior to visualization of the larynx.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation against imaging</span></em> based on observational studies of harm, absence of evidence concerning benefit, and a preponderance of harm over benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile: 5</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To reduce variations of care and unnecessary expense as well as harm from radiation and/or contrast exposure. National Quality Strategy domain: Making Quality Care More Affordable. </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies regarding the adverse events of CT and MRI; no evidence identified concerning benefits among patients with dysphonia before laryngoscopy </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Avoid unnecessary testing and overdiagnosis; minimize cost and adverse events; maximize the diagnostic yield of CT and MRI when indicated; avoid radiation </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Potential for delayed/missed diagnosis </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 6. Antireflux Medication and Dysphonia</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should not prescribe antireflux medications to treat isolated dysphonia, based on symptoms alone attributed to suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), without visualization of the larynx.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation against prescribing</span></em> based on randomized trials with limitations and observational studies with a preponderance of harm over benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile: 6</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To limit widespread use of antireflux medications as empiric therapy for dysphonia without symptoms of GERD or seeing changes in the larynx associated with LPR or laryngitis, given limited evidence of benefit and the potential adverse effects of the medications. National Quality Strategy domains: Prevention and Treatment of Leading Causes of Morbidity and Mortality; Patient Safety; Making Quality Care More Affordable. </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, randomized trials with limitations showing lack of benefits for antireflux therapy among patients with laryngeal symptoms alone, including dysphonia; observational studies with inconsistent or inconclusive results; inconclusive evidence regarding the prevalence of dysphonia as the only manifestation of reflux disease </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium based on small inconsistent randomized trials with heterogeneous entry criteria and poorly defined outcome measures </li>
    <li>Benefit: Avoidance of unnecessary therapy; reduced cost; avoidance of complications from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs); avoidance of diagnostic and treatment delay due to course of PPI therapy. </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Potential withholding of therapy from patients who may benefit </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The committee thought that there is general overuse of these medications and that they have limited usefulness for most patients with dysphonia but that there may be a role for antireflux medications in a subset of hard-to-define cases. They also recognize that there is a role for these medications to treat gastroesophageal reflux </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Small </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation against </li>
    <li>Differences of opinions: The panel was divided about whether to include the terms <em>GERD</em> and <em>LPR</em> in the action statement or to leave it simply as symptoms alone. The majority favored inclusion of these terms in the KAS </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 7. Corticosteroid therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should not routinely prescribe corticosteroids for patients with dysphonia prior to visualization of the larynx.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation against prescribing</span></em> based on randomized trials showing adverse events and absence of clinical trials demonstrating benefits with a preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile: 7</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: To discourage the empiric use of steroids for dysphonia prior to laryngeal examination. National Quality Strategy domains: Prevention and Treatment of Leading Causes of Morbidity and Mortality; Patient Safety; Making Quality Care More Affordable. </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, randomized trials showing increased incidence of adverse events associated with orally administered steroids; absence of clinical trials demonstrating any benefit of steroid treatment on outcomes </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Avoid potential adverse events associated with unproven therapy </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: None </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Avoid adverse events of ineffective or unproven therapy </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The word <em>routine</em> is used to acknowledge that there may be specific situations, based on laryngoscopy results, or other associated conditions that may justify steroid use on an individualized basis </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Small; there is a role for shared decision making in weighing the harms of steroids against the potential yet unproven benefit in specific circumstances (i.e., professional or avocation voice use and acute laryngitis) </li>
    <li>Exclusions: Children with croup </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation against </li>
    <li>Differences of opinions: None </li>

    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Avoidance of ineffective therapy, unnecessary cost, and antibiotic resistance </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Potential for failing to treat bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial causes of dysphonia </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of harm over benefit if antibiotics are prescribed </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Importance of limiting antimicrobial therapy to treating bacterial or fungal infections </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>An information specialist conducted 3 literature searches from December 2015 through April 2016 using a validated filter strategy to identify CPGs, systematic reviews, and RCTs. The search terms used were as follows: ("hoarseness"[MeSH Terms] OR "hoarseness"[tw] OR "hoarse"[tw] OR "aphonia"[MeSH Terms] OR "aphonia"[tw] OR "phonation disorder"[tw] OR "dysphonia"[MeSH Terms] OR "dysphonia"[tw] OR "phonation disorders"[tw] OR "voice disorder"[tw] OR "voice disorders"[tw] OR "vocal disorder"[tw] OR "vocal disorders"[tw] OR laryngitis[tw] OR "laryngeal disorder"[tw] OR "laryngeal disorders"[tw]). These search terms were used to capture all evidence on the population by incorporating all relevant treatments and outcomes.</p>
<p>The English-language searches were performed in multiple databases: Health Services/Technology Assessment Texts (HSTAT), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), BIOSIS Previews, CAB Abstracts, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), EMBASE, Guidelines International Network (GIN) International Guideline Library, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database, NNHS Economic Evaluation Database National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, New Zealand Guidelines Group, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), TRIP Database, Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Infobase, National Guideline Clearinghouse, PubMed Search, and CINAHL.</p>
<p>The initial English-language search identified 106 clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), 561 systematic reviews, and 516 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2008 or later. CPGs were included if they met quality criteria of (1) an explicit scope and purpose, (2) multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement, (3) systematic literature review, (4) explicit system for ranking evidence, and (5) explicit system for linking evidence to recommendations. Systematic reviews were emphasized and included if they met quality criteria of (1) a clear objective and methodology, (2) an explicit search strategy, and (3) valid data extraction methods. RCTs were included if they met quality criteria as follows: (1) trials involved study randomization; (2) trials were described as double-blind; and (3) trials denoted a clear description of withdrawals and dropouts of study participants. After removal of duplicates, irrelevant references, and non&ndash;English language articles, 6 CPGs, 55 systematic reviews, and 24 RCTs were retained. In certain instances, targeted searches were performed by guideline update group (GUG) members to address gaps from the systematic searches identified in writing the guideline from June 2016 through February 2017. </p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) assembled a guideline update group (GUG) representing the disciplines of advanced practice nursing, bronchoesophagology, consumer advocacy, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, laryngology, neurology, otolaryngology&ndash;head and neck surgery, pediatrics, professional voice, pulmonology, and speech-language pathology. The GUG had several conference calls and 1 in-person meeting during which it defined the scope and objectives of updating the guideline, reviewed comments from the expert panel review for each key action statement (KAS), identified other quality improvement opportunities, reviewed the literature search results, and drafted the document.</p>
<p>The evidence profile for each statement in the earlier guideline was then converted into an expanded action statement profile for consistency with the current development standards. Information was added to the action statement profiles regarding quality improvement opportunities, level of confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, role of patient preferences, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. New KASs were developed with an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm. Electronic decision support software (BRIDGE-Wiz; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) was used to facilitate the creation of actionable recommendations and evidence profiles.</p>
<p>The updated guideline underwent GuideLine Implementability Appraisal to appraise adherence to methodologic standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. The GUG received summary appraisals and modified an advanced draft of the guideline based on the appraisal.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In one study, adverse effects included mild breathiness (25%) and coughing on fluids (10%) for the patients with adductor spasmodic dysphonia (SD) and "mild stridor" for the patients with abductor SD. Many other studies documented similar rates of adverse effects (breathiness and dysphagia, choking on fluids). Postinjection dysphagia may be more common among patients with preexisting dysphagia. Exertional wheezing, exercise intolerance, and stridor were more commonly reported for patients with abductor SD. Adverse events may result from diffusion of drug from the target muscle to adjacent muscles ("black box warning" by the FDA). Adjusting the dose, distribution, and timing of injections may decrease the frequency of adverse events. Bleeding is rare, and vocal fold edema was documented for only 1 patient receiving saline as a placebo. Reports of sensations of burning, tickling, irritation of the larynx or throat, excessive thick secretions, and dryness also occurred. Systemic effects are rare, with only 2 reports of generalized botulism-like syndromes and 1 report of possible precipitation of biliary colic. Acquired resistance to botulinum toxin can occur. </li>
    <li>Refer to Table 8 in the original guideline document for side effects of corticosteroids. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is not intended as an exhaustive source of guidance for managing dysphonia (hoarseness). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions, but they are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates. These do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible physician, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment but rather may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a "strong recommendation" as compared with a "recommendation." "Options" offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. They must also operate within their scope of practice and according to their training. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline panel sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. </li>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The complete guideline is published as a supplement to <em>Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em> to facilitate reference and distribution. The guideline was presented to American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNS) members as a miniseminar at the AAO-HNSF 2017 Annual Meeting &amp; OTO Experience prior to publication. Existing brochures and publications by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline recommendations. A fulltext version of the guideline will also be accessible free of charge at <a href="http://www.entnet.org" title="American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNS) Web site">www.entnet.org</a>.</p>
<p>An anticipated barrier to diagnosis is distinguishing modifying factors for dysphonia in a busy clinical setting. This barrier may be mitigated through a laminated teaching card or visual aid summarizing important factors that modify management.</p>
<p>Laryngoscopy is an option at any time for patients with dysphonia, but the guideline also recommends that no patient be allowed to wait &gt;4 weeks prior to having his or her larynx examined. It is also clearly recommended that if there is a concern of an underlying serious condition, then laryngoscopy should be immediate. Tables in this guideline regarding causes for concern should help guide clinicians regarding when prompt laryngoscopy is warranted. The cost of the laryngoscopy and the possible wait times to see clinicians trained in the technique may hinder access to care.</p>
<p>While the guideline acknowledges that there may be a significant role for antireflux therapy to treat laryngeal inflammation, empiric use of antireflux medications for dysphonia has minimal support and a growing list of potential risks. Avoidance of empiric use of antireflux therapy represents a significant change in practice for some clinicians. Educational pamphlets describing the risks and benefits of these medications may help facilitate this potential change in practice pattern.</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge about voice therapy by practitioners is a likely barrier to advocacy for its use. This barrier can be overcome by educational materials about voice therapy and its indications.</p></div>

<p>The cost of developing this guideline, including travel expenses of all panel members, was covered in full by the American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 2 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established "stake" in an issue.</p>
