Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>, <strong>Further research needed</strong>) and quality of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Very Low</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Do Clinical Outcomes Vary Across Levels of Obesity in Critically Ill or Hospitalized Non-Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Patients?</strong></p>
<p>Critically ill patients with obesity experience more complications than patients with optimal body mass index (BMI) levels. Nutrition assessment and development of a nutrition support plan is recommended within 48 hours of ICU admission (<strong>Strong</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Low</strong></p>
<p>All hospitalized patients, regardless of BMI, should be screened for nutrition risk within 48 hours of admission, with nutrition assessment for patients who are considered at risk (<strong>Strong</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Low</strong></p>
<p><strong>How Should Energy Requirements Be Determined in Obese Critically Ill or Hospitalized Non-ICU Patients?</strong></p>
<p>In the critically ill obese patient, if indirect calorimetry is unavailable, energy requirements should be based on the Penn State University 2010 predictive equation or the modified Penn State University equation if the patient is over the age of 60 years (<strong>Strong</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>High</strong></p>
<p>In the hospitalized obese patient, if indirect calorimetry is unavailable and the Penn State University equations cannot be used, energy requirements may be based on the Mifflin&ndash;St Jeor equation using actual body weight (<strong>Weak</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Moderate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Are Clinical Outcomes Improved With Hypocaloric, High Protein Diets in Hospitalized Patients With Obesity?</strong></p>
<p>Clinical outcomes are at least equivalent in patients supported with high protein hypocaloric feeding to those supported with high protein eucaloric feeding. A trial of hypocaloric high protein feeding is suggested in patients who do not have severe renal or hepatic dysfunction (<strong>Weak</strong>). Hypocaloric feeding may be started with 50% to 70% of estimated energy requirements or &lt;14 kcal/kg actual weight. High protein feeding may be started with 1.2 g/kg actual weight or 2 to 2.5 g/kg ideal body weight, with adjustment of goal protein intake by the results of nitrogen balance studies.</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Low</strong></p>
<p>Hypocaloric low protein feedings are associated with unfavorable outcomes. Clinical vigilance for adequate protein provision is suggested in patients who do not have severe renal or hepatic dysfunction (<strong>Weak</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Low</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Obese Patients Who Have Had Malabsorptive or Restrictive Surgical Procedures for Weight Loss, What Micronutrients Should Be Evaluated?</strong></p>
<p>Patients who have undergone sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, or biliopancreatic diversion &plusmn; duodenal switch have increased risk of nutrient deficiency. In acutely ill hospitalized patients with history of these procedures, evaluation for evidence of depletion of iron, copper, zinc, selenium, thiamine, folate, and vitamins B<sub>12</sub>, and D is suggested as well as repletion of deficiency states. (<strong>Weak</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Evidence Grade</em>: <strong>Low</strong></p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The questions addressed in the guideline are summarized in Table 1 of the original guideline document. With the assistance of a reference librarian a search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL on August 1, 2012, and updated May 2, 2013, using inclusion criteria of adult subjects, English language, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and publications over the past 10 years. Search terms "obesity," "clinical outcomes," "mortality," "infection," "parenteral nutrition," and "enteral nutrition" were applied in various combinations for Questions 1 to 3. For Question 1, 31 articles met the inclusion criteria. For Question 2, 9 articles that described measures in hospitalized or clinical populations of obese patients and that reported data with accuracy and bias rates were included. For Question 3, the time limitation was relaxed to obtain all published information on the topic, yielding 8 articles. For Question 4, search terms of "copper," "zinc," "iron," "selenium," "vitamin deficiency," "nutrient deficiency," "gastric bypass," "biliopancreatic diversion," "vitamin D," and "bariatric surgery" were used in various combinations with a time limitation of the past 10 years, which yielded 22 articles.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) clinical guidelines are based on general conclusions of health professionals who, in developing such guidelines, have balanced potential benefits to be derived from a particular mode of medical therapy against certain risks inherent with such therapy. However, the professional judgment of the attending health professional is the primary component of quality medical care. Because guidelines cannot account for every variation in circumstances, the practitioner must always exercise professional judgment in their application.
