<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the risk-adjusted rate of readmission following discharge for a mental illness.</p>
<p>The mental illnesses selected for this indicator are substance-related disorders; schizophrenia, delusional and non-organic psychotic disorders; mood/affective disorders; anxiety disorders; and selected disorders of adult personality and behavior. </p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Readmission to inpatient care may be an indicator of relapse or complications after an inpatient stay. Inpatient care for a person living with a mental illness aims to stabilize acute symptoms. Once stabilized, the individual is discharged, and subsequent care and support are ideally provided through outpatient and community programs in order to prevent relapse or complications. High rates of 30-day readmission could be interpreted as a direct outcome of poor coordination of services and/or an indirect outcome of poor continuity of services after discharge. </p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Indicators are reported at the national, provincial/territorial, and regional levels. </li>
    <li>Unless otherwise specified, for indicators based on place of residence, data is reported based on the region of the patient's residence, not region of hospitalization. Consequently, these figures reflect the hospitalization experience of residents of the region wherever they are treated, including out of province, as opposed to the comprehensive activity of the region's hospitals (that will also treat people from outside of the region). Hospitalizations occurring in the U.S. or abroad are not included. </li>
    <li>For indicators based on place of service (where the patient was treated), data is reported based on the administrative region of the facility (e.g., region of hospitalization). </li>
    <li>Rates are standardized or risk-adjusted wherever possible to facilitate comparability across provinces/regions/facilities and over time. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Risk Adjustment</em></p>
<p>Statistical regression modelling, an indirect method of standardization in risk adjustment, was used to risk-adjust patient characteristics. Risk factors that were controlled for include age, gender and selected pre-admit comorbid diagnoses that were applicable to the indicator. The selected risk factors were identified based on a literature review, clinical evidence and expert group consultations using the principles of appropriateness, viability (i.e., sufficient number of events) and data availability. Risk factors must be listed as significant pre-admit conditions on the patient's abstract for them to be identified for risk adjustment. For indicators relating to readmission after certain medical conditions (e.g., Readmission After Acute Myocardial Infarction [AMI], Overall Readmission), diagnoses were flagged as risk factors if they were recorded as pre-admit conditions on any of the records within patients' episodes of care. For all other indicators, risk factors were flagged if conditions were recorded as pre-admit diagnoses on the record where the outcome/denominator was abstracted.</p>
<p>Risk-adjusted rates are calculated at the hospital, health administration region and provincial/territorial levels. Regional and provincial risk-adjusted rates are aggregated hospital-level data.</p>
<p>Refer to the <em>General Methodology Notes</em> document (see the "Companion Documents" field) for additional information on risk adjustment. Information on Canada averages, model specifications (coefficients and p-values) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Canadian Enhancement (ICD-10-CA) codes used to flag risk factors can be found in the <em>Model Specifications</em> document (see the "Companion Documents" field).</p>
