Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>A&ndash;C</strong>) and strength of recommendations (strong [grade <strong>1</strong>], weak [grade <strong>2</strong>]) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and CMV disease should be diagnosed according to established, internationally accepted, standardized criteria (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Risk-adapted patient assessment should inform clinical management (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Host and Donor CMV Serostatus</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>All potential haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients should be tested for the presence of CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody at diagnosis (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Once optimum human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matching has been performed, a CMV IgG-negative donor should be chosen for a CMV IgG-negative recipient and a CMV IgG-positive donor should be chosen for CMV IgG-positive recipient when possible (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Donors or recipients who are initially found to be CMV IgG-negative should be retested pre-transplant to exclude primary CMV infection (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Apparent CMV seroconversion in potential allograft recipients who have received unscreened blood products should be actively investigated to exclude passively acquired antibody (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Any CMV IgG-negative HSCT recipient transplanted from a CMV IgG-negative donor who develops CMV infection post-transplant must be reported to the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Primary and Secondary Prophylaxis for CMV</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Primary prophylaxis with ganciclovir is not generally recommended as toxicity outweighs efficacy in HSCT patients (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Primary prophylaxis with aciclovir or valaciclovir can be deployed but only in conjunction with appropriate monitoring of CMV in the blood (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Valaciclovir or valganciclovir are valid treatment options for secondary prophylaxis with appropriate monitoring of CMV in the blood (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Intravenous immunoglobulins are not recommended for prophylaxis of CMV infection (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pre-emptive Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred option for monitoring CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels in HSCT patients (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>All diagnostic laboratories should deploy the CMV international standard to allow CMV DNA loads to be compared between centres (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Monitoring of CMV DNA load should be undertaken at least weekly for the first 3 months post-HSCT (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>CMV viral load monitoring should continue to 6&ndash;12 months if the patient has chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or prolonged T-cell immunodeficiency (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Treatment Thresholds</em></p>
<p>Each transplant centre should have a risk-adapted policy detailing threshold values for treatment of CMV infection, taking into account patient factors and local PCR methodology (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Antiviral Agents Used in Pre-emptive Therapy</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Ganciclovir is recommended as first line pre-emptive therapy for CMV in HSCT patients (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Oral valganciclovir is a useful alternative when gastrointestinal absorption is normal or minimally impaired (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Foscarnet is recommended as an alternative first line agent if neutropenia is present or for ganciclovir treatment failures (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Pre-emptive therapy with cidofovir can be considered as third line in patients unresponsive or intolerant of a ganciclovir preparation or foscarnet (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Switching Pre-emptive Therapy</em></p>
<p>In patients where CMV DNA loads in blood increase by 1 log<sub>10</sub> over 2 weeks of pre-emptive therapy with a first line drug, an alternative agent and drug resistance profiling should be considered (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Antiviral Drug Resistance</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Drug resistance should be considered if the CMV DNA load in blood fails to respond after 14 days of therapy, especially in non-lymphopenic or multiply pre-treated patients (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Sequence analysis of the UL97 and UL54 genes is the preferred option for monitoring resistance to currently available drugs (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Management of CMV Disease</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A multidisciplinary approach to management of CMV disease is required (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li><em>De novo</em> CMV disease should be treated with ganciclovir or foscarnet, plus intravenous immunoglobulin (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>CMV disease that develops while on pre-emptive therapy or is clinically progressive requires drug resistance testing, increased drug doses and/or a change of drug (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Reduction in immunosuppression, especially corticosteroid dosage, is strongly recommended (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence is graded as high (A), moderate (B) or low (C). To put this in context it is useful to consider the uncertainty of knowledge and whether further research could change what is known or is certain.</p>
<p><strong>(A) High</strong> Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect. Current evidence derived from randomised clinical trials without important limitations.</p>
<p><strong>(B) Moderate</strong> Further research may well have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Current evidence derived from randomised clinical trials with important limitations (e.g., inconsistent results, imprecision &ndash; wide confidence intervals or methodological flaws &ndash; e.g., lack of blinding, large losses to follow up, failure to adhere to intention to treat analysis), or very strong evidence from observational studies or case series (e.g., large or very large and consistent estimates of the magnitude of a treatment effect or demonstration of a dose-response gradient).</p>
<p><strong>(C) Low</strong> Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Current evidence from observational studies, case series, or just opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong (grade 1)</strong>: Strong recommendations (grade 1) are made when there is confidence that the benefits do or do not outweigh harm and burden. Grade 1 recommendations can be applied uniformly to most patients. Regard as 'recommend'.</p>
<p><strong>Weak (grade 2)</strong>: Where the magnitude of benefit or not is less certain a weaker grade 2 recommendation is made. Grade 2 recommendations require judicious application to individual patients. Regard as 'suggest'.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Drugs Used for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Prevention</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Ganciclovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of CMV infection and disease during the period of prophylaxis. However neutropenia occurred in up to 30% of cases treated and infective complications were increased. </li>
    <li>Prolonged exposure of CMV to ganciclovir, especially in the setting of T-cell depletion, may encourage resistance, as occurs in solid organ transplantation. </li>
    <li>Routine use of aciclovir or valaciclovir for CMV prophylaxis is relatively non-toxic but will result in some patients being overtreated. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Ganciclovir: myelosuppression </li>

    <li>Foscarnet: electrolyte abnormalities, renal impairment, nausea/vomiting, genitourinary, urinary symptoms </li>
    <li>Cidofovir: renal impairment, nausea/vomiting, ocular </li>
