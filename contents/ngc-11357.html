Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the classification of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>1-3</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>Please see the full-text version of this guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for the target population of each recommendation listed below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>What surgical approaches for vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are best for complete resection and facial nerve (FN) preservation when serviceable hearing is present?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the MF or the RS approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is present.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Which surgical approach (RS or translabyrinthine [TL]) for VS is best for complete resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the RS or the TL approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>Does VS size matter for facial and vestibulocochlear nerve preservation with surgical resection?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Patients with larger VS tumor size should be counseled about the greater than average risk of loss of serviceable hearing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>Should small intracanalicular tumors (&lt;1.5 cm) be surgically resected?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There are insufficient data to support a firm recommendation that surgery be the primary treatment for this subclass of VSs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p>Is hearing preservation routinely possible with VS surgical resection when serviceable hearing is present?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Hearing preservation surgery via the MF or the RS approach may be attempted in patients with small tumor size (&lt;1.5 cm) and good preoperative hearing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p>When should surgical resection be the initial treatment in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence that surgical resection should be the initial treatment in patients with NF2.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 7</span></strong></p>
<p>Does a multidisciplinary team, consisting of neurosurgery and neurotology, provide the best outcomes of complete resection and facial/vestibulocochlear nerve preservation for patients undergoing resection of VSs?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support stating that a multidisciplinary team, usually consisting of a neurosurgeon and a neurotologist, provides superior outcomes compared to either subspecialist working alone.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 8</span></strong></p>
<p>Does a subtotal surgical resection of a VS followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the residual tumor provide comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support subtotal resection (STR) followed by SRS provides comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 9</span></strong></p>
<p>Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative balance problems more effectively than SRS?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support either surgical resection or SRS for treatment of preoperative balance problems.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 10</span></strong></p>
<p>Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative trigeminal neuralgia more effectively than SRS?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Surgical resection of VSs may be used to better relieve symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia than SRS.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 11</span></strong></p>
<p>Is surgical resection of VSs more difficult (associated with higher facial neuropathies and STR rates) after initial treatment with SRS?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: If microsurgical resection is necessary after SRS, it is recommended that patients be counseled that there is an increased likelihood of a STR and decreased FN function.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Method</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published from January 1990 through 2014. Two electronic databases, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (see the full guideline for search strategies [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]), were searched. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the medical librarian using standard strategies to identify relevant studies.</p>
<p>The authors supplemented the searches of electronic databases with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The authors also searched the bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed below. As noted above, the guideline committee also examined lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions. The authors went to great lengths to obtain a complete set of relevant articles. Having a complete set ensured that this guideline is not based on a biased subset of articles.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>A total of 2949 citations were manually reviewed by the team with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined below. Two independent reviewers evaluated and abstracted full-text data for each article, and the 2 sets of data were compared for agreement by a third party. Inconsistencies were re-reviewed, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Citations that considered adult patients focusing on surgical treatment of VSs were considered. To be included in this guideline, an article must be a report of a study that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having vestibular schwannomas (VSs) </li>
    <li>Patients &ge;18 years of age </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014 </li>
    <li>Quantitatively presented results </li>
    <li>Was not an in vitro study (for novel molecular markers, in vitro studies were included on patient samples) </li>
    <li>Was not a biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Was published in English </li>
    <li>Was not a meeting abstract, editorial, letter, or commentary </li>
    <li>Studies may include mixed pathology; however, the data pertaining to VSs was abstractable from the paper </li>
    <li>Had &gt;5 patients or patient samples </li>
</ul>
<p>The authors did not include systematic reviews, guidelines, or meta-analyses conducted by others. These documents are developed using different inclusion criteria than those specified in this guideline. Therefore, they may include studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria specified above. These documents were recalled if their abstract suggested that they might address one of the recommendations, and their bibliographies were searched for additional studies.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Collection Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The abstracts that met the selection criteria were retrieved in full-text form. Each article's adherence to the selection criteria was confirmed. To determine how the data could be classified, the information in the full-text articles were then evaluated to determine whether they were providing results of therapy or were more centered on diagnostic or prognostic information. Agreement on these assessments and on the salient points regarding the type of study design and objectives, and the conclusions and data classification was then reached by exchanging drafts and comments by e-mail. The information was then used for construction of the evidence tables.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment for Risk of Bias</span></strong></p>
<p>All the literature reviewed was class III evidence (i.e., evidence from nonexperimental descriptive studies, such as comparative studies, correlation studies, and case-control studies). Because the data analyzed were all class III, bias could be present because of selective case choice for study and selective results reporting, lack or loss of information over time, the biases of the interpreting investigator in regard to the study, publication bias regarding positive studies or positive cases, misclassification, survivorship bias, publication bias, recognition that data collected in this retrospective or prospective manner does not imply causation, selection bias, attrition bias, change in methods over time, ascertainment bias, hidden agenda bias, and variability caused by random error related to problems with unintentional data entry oversight and neglect.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writing Group and Question Establishment</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) have prioritized writing the guidelines for management of vestibular schwannomas (VSs). A series of authors for the development of guidelines related to surgical management of VSs were identified and screened for conflict of interest. This group in turn agreed on a set of questions addressing the topic at hand and conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the surgical management of VSs. Additional details of the systematic review are provided within the introduction and methodology chapter of the original guideline document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification of Evidence and Guideline Recommendation Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The concept of linking evidence to recommendations has been further formalized by the American Medical Association (AMA) and many specialty societies, including AANS, CNS, and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). This formalization involves the designation of specific relationships between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations to avoid ambiguity. In the paradigm for therapeutic maneuvers, evidence is classified according to the scheme in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields). A basis for these guidelines can be viewed in the Joint Guidelines Committee methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables, and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The Vestibular Schwannoma Guidelines Task Force members were required to report all possible conflicts of interest (COIs) prior to beginning work on the guideline, using the COI disclosure form of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Guidelines Committee, including potential COIs that are unrelated to the topic of the guideline. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair reviewed the disclosures and either approved or disapproved the nomination. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair are given latitude to approve nominations of Task Force members with possible conflicts and address this by restricting the writing and reviewing privileges of that person to topics unrelated to the possible COIs. The conflict of interest findings are provided in detail in the full-text introduction and methods manuscript (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>
