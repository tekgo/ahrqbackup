<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Very Low</strong>) and the strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Conditional</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 1</strong></span></p>
<p>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions requiring pulp therapy, is one particular therapy (indirect pulp therapy [IPT], direct pulp cap [DPC], pulpotomy) more successful than others?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The panel was unable to make a recommendation on superiority of any particular type of vital pulp therapy owing to lack of studies directly comparing these interventions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 2</strong></span></p>
<p>In vital primary teeth treated with indirect pulp treatment due to deep caries lesions, does the choice of medicament affect success? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The panel found that the success of IPT in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions was independent of the type of medicament used, and therefore recommends that clinicians choose the medicament based on individual preferences. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence [24 months], Low quality evidence [48 months]</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 3</strong></span></p>
<p>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with direct pulp cap due to pulp exposure (one mm or less) encountered during carious dentin removal, does the choice of medicament affect success? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The panel found that in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with DPC due to pulp exposure (one mm or less) encountered during caries removal, the success of DPC was independent of the type of medicament (dentin bonding agents, mineral trioxide aggregate [MTA], and formocresol), and therefore recommends that clinicians choose the medicament based on individual preferences. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, very-low quality evidence</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 4</strong></span></p>
<p>In vital primary teeth with deep caries treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during caries removal, does the choice of medicament or technique affect success? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The panel recommends the use of MTA in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of formocresol in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of ferric sulfate (FS) in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of lasers in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends the use of tricalcium silicate in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence</strong>) </li>
    <li>The panel recommends against the use of calcium hydroxide in vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during carious dentin removal. (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence</strong>) </li>

<p>Evidence from "Primary Tooth Vital Pulp Therapy: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis" is the basis for the current guideline's recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Search Strategy and Evidence Inclusion Criteria</strong></span></p>
<p>Since it was decided a priori to use the aforementioned systematic review, multiple literature searches were conducted in PubMed&reg;/MEDLINE, EMBASE&reg;, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and trial databases to identify randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews addressing peripheral issues not covered by the review, such as patient preferences and impact of cost. The search strategy was updated by one of the authors. Title and abstract and, when warranted, full-text of studies were reviewed in duplicate by workgroup members. See the Appendix in the original guideline document for the search strategy.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Workgroup and Stakeholders</strong></span></p>
<p>In December, 2016, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) Board of Trustees approved a panel nominated by the Evidence-Based Dentistry Committee to develop a new evidence-based clinical practice guideline on vital pulp therapies in primary teeth with deep caries lesions. The panel consisted of pediatric dentists in public and private practice involved in research and education; the stakeholders consisted of authors of the systematic review in addition to representatives from general dentistry, governmental and non-governmental agencies, and international and specialty dental organizations. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Questions Addressed</strong></span></p>
<p>The panel members used the Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcome (PICO) formulation to develop the following clinical questions that will aid clinicians in the use of vital pulp therapies in primary teeth with deep caries lesions. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions requiring pulp therapy, is one particular therapy (indirect pulp treatment, direct pulp cap, pulpotomy) more successful* than others? </li>
    <li>In vital primary teeth treated with indirect pulp treatment due to deep caries lesions, does the choice of medicament affect success*? </li>
    <li>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with direct pulp cap due to pulp exposure (one mm or less) encountered during carious dentin removal, does the choice of medicament affect success*? </li>
    <li>In vital primary teeth with deep caries lesions treated with pulpotomy due to pulp exposure during caries removal, does the choice of medicament or technique affect success*? </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note">*Success was defined as overall success simultaneously observed both clinically and radiographically.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Formulation of the Recommendation</strong></span> </p>
<p>To formulate the recommendations, the panel used an evidence-to-decision framework including domains such as priority of the problem, certainty in the evidence, balance between desirable and undesirable consequences, and patients' values and preferences. The strength of a recommendation was assessed to be either strong or conditional, which presents different implications for patients, clinicians, and policy makers (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). </p>
<p>The guidelines were formulated via teleconferences and online forum discussion with members of the workgroup. The panel members discussed all recommendations and issues surrounding the topic under review, and all significant topics such as recommendations were voted upon anonymously.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understanding the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>A strong recommendation implies in most situations that clinicians should follow the suggested intervention. A conditional recommendation indicates that while the clinician may want to follow the suggested intervention, the panel recognizes that different choices may be appropriate for individual patients. </p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cost-effectiveness of Recommendation</strong></span></p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness of a treatment is based on initial and possible retreatment costs. Such a cost-analysis for therapies with proven health benefits and minimal adverse effects is an important consideration for clinicians, patients, and third-party payors. This is especially important when different procedures with similar outcomes are available to treat a specific condition like in the case of vital pulp therapies. A research brief covering claims data for all children with private dental insurance lists vital pulpotomy, in primary or permanent teeth, as one of top 25 most common procedures performed in children with private dental benefits. For ages one through six years, the spending is estimated to be $257, ranging from $160 for children in the lowest quartile of spending to $996 among children in the highest quartile of spending. Considering the number of pulp therapies performed on a population level, cost-effective treatment is a public health issue. However, very limited data exist on cost-effectiveness of various pulp therapies in the primary dentition. The most expensive pulp treatments and modalities with regards to initial costs are mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and laser. Interestingly, a German study using the Markov model followed the first permanent molar with vital asymptomatic exposed pulp treated with direct pulp cap (DPC) using MTA or calcium hydroxide over the lifetime of a 20 year old patient and reported that MTA was more cost-effective than calcium hydroxide despite higher initial treatment costs because expensive retreatments were avoided. </p>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The panel did not find sufficient evidence on adverse events related to medicaments used for indirect pulp therapy (IPT), direct pulp cap (DPC), and pulpotomy that could influence the quality of evidence. However, the panel recognizes that there may still be parental concerns regarding formocresol toxicity and discolorations associated with MTA and recommends that the clinicians should explain the evidence to parents and make decisions based on individual preferences. The panel encourages providers to closely monitor any updates from the CDC on <em>Mycobacterium. abscessus</em> infection related to pulpotomy procedures for its future implications and possible impact on the evidence.</p>

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's (AAPD's) first evidence-based guideline on pulp therapy, is published in both the journal <em>Pediatric Dentistry</em> and the AAPD's Reference Manual. By meeting the standards of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) regarding the production of clinical practice guidelines, these recommendations will be submitted to the National Guidelines Clearinghouse&trade; (NGC), a database of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and related documents maintained as a public resource by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS). Inclusion in the NGC guarantees the guidelines will be accessible and disseminated to private and public payors, policy makers, and the public. Additionally, AAPD members will be notified of the new guidelines via social media, newsletters, and presentations. The guidelines are available as an open access publication on the AAPD's Web site. Patient education materials are being developed and will be offered in the AAPD's online bookstore. </p>
