<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The following recommendations apply to the prescription of intravenous (IV) maintenance fluids in children one month corrected age to 18 years of age, excluding patients with renal or cardiac disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe burns or other underlying conditions that significantly affect electrolyte regulation.</p>
<p><strong>General Principles</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Any child in hospital who requires IV fluids should be considered at risk for developing hyponatremia due to increased risk of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. At particular risk are:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Children undergoing surgery </li>
        <li>Children with acute neurological or respiratory infections (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, pneumonia and bronchiolitis) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Oral fluids are generally very low in Na content (hypotonic). Where the total fluid intake (TFI) is a combination of oral and IV fluids, both need to be accounted for. </li>
    <li>Because infants and young children have limited glycogen stores, dextrose should be part of the IV maintenance fluid prescription (e.g., 5% dextrose in water and 0.9% NaCl [D5W.0.9%NaCl] or 5% dextrose in water and 0.45% NaCl [D5W.0.45%NaCl]) if no other source of glucose is provided. </li>
    <li>The approach to prescribing IV fluids should be as cautious as that for medications, with close attention paid to indications, monitoring, the type of fluid and the volume/rate of administration. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Baseline serum electrolytes (Na, K, glucose, urea, creatinine) should be measured when starting IV fluid therapy in hospitalized children. </li>
    <li>Children receiving maintenance IV fluids should have their serum electrolytes checked regularly, with patients who may be at high risk of impaired renal water excretion checked daily if not more frequently. </li>
    <li>All children receiving IV maintenance fluids should have their intake/output carefully monitored, as well as a daily weight measurement. </li>
    <li>Clinicians should be aware of the symptoms of hyponatremia, which may include headache, nausea and vomiting, decrease in level of consciousness, seizures and apnea. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prescription of IV fluids for Maintenance Requirements</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In children whose serum sodium is normal at baseline but who are considered to be at particularly high risk of ADH secretion (e.g., peri- or postoperative; with respiratory or neurological infections) the use of isotonic saline (D5W.0.9%NaCl) is recommended. </li>
    <li>For other hospitalized children whose serum sodium is normal, the options are D5W.0.9%NaCl or D5W.0.45%NaCl. The first option is preferred, especially when the serum Na is in the low normal range (135 mmol/L to 137 mmol/L inclusive). </li>
    <li>Hypotonic IV fluids containing &lt;0.45% NaCl should not be used to provide routine fluid maintenance and should not be generally available on paediatric wards. </li>
    <li>When serum electrolyte results are not yet available, it is recommended that D5W.0.9% NaCl be initiated as the maintenance IV fluid. </li>
    <li>If the serum sodium is 145 mmol/L to 154 mmol/L, then D5W.0.45% NaCl should be initiated and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium performed. </li>
    <li>Ringer's lactate is commonly used in the operating room but the absence of dextrose and presence of lactate make it generally inappropriate for maintenance IV therapy, especially in young children. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate prescription of intravenous (IV) maintenance fluids in hospitalized children one month to 18 years of age to avoid acute hyponatremia </li>
    <li>Recent studies suggest that, compared with hypotonic IV maintenance fluids, isotonic fluids decrease the risk of iatrogenic acute hyponatremia without significant side effects. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Normal saline contains 154 mmol/L of Na, which is isotonic with respect to the cell membrane. This suggestion has raised concerns regarding the potential for hypernatremia and salt and water overload. However, unless the child has an impaired ability to excrete Na, a renal concentrating defect, significant water loss or prolonged fluid restriction, these risks appear to be largely theoretical. The risk of developing hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis has been recognized in the context of rapid isotonic saline infusion delivered perioperatively but has not been reported in the trials of intravenous saline used for maintenance requirements in children to date.</p></div>
