<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Tobacco use is the single greatest cause of disease in the United States today and accounts for more than 435,000 deaths each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2008; McGinnis &amp; Foege, 1993). Smoking is a known cause of multiple cancers, heart disease, stroke, complications of pregnancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other respiratory problems, poorer wound healing, and many other diseases (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2004). Tobacco use creates a heavy cost to society as well as to individuals. Smoking-attributable health care expenditures are estimated at $96 billion per year in direct medical expenses and $97 billion in lost productivity (CDC, 2007). </p>
<p>There is strong and consistent evidence that tobacco dependence interventions, if delivered in a timely and effective manner, significantly reduce the user's risk of suffering from tobacco-related disease and improve outcomes for those already suffering from a tobacco-related disease (DHHS, 2000; Baumeister et al., 2007; Lightwood, 2003; Lightwood &amp; Glantz, 1997; Rasmussen et al., 2005; Hurley, 2005; Critchley &amp; Capewell, 2003; Ford et al., 2007; Rigotti, Munafo, &amp; Stead 2008). Effective, evidence-based tobacco dependence interventions have been clearly identified and include brief clinician advice; individual, group, or telephone counseling; and use of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cessation medications. These treatments are clinically effective and extremely cost-effective relative to other commonly used disease prevention interventions and medical treatments. Studies indicate that the combination of counseling and medications is more effective for tobacco cessation than either medication or counseling alone (Fiore et al., 2008), except in specific populations for which there is insufficient evidence of the effectiveness and/or safety of the FDA-approved cessation medications. These populations include pregnant women, smokeless tobacco users, light smokers, and adolescents. Hospitalization (both because hospitals are a tobacco-free environment and because patients may be more motivated to quit as a result of their illness) offers an ideal opportunity to provide cessation assistance that may promote the patient's medical recovery. Patients who receive even brief advice and intervention from their care providers are more likely to quit than those who receive no intervention.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Hospitalization is an ideal time to encourage smokers to quit. During hospitalization, smokers are not allowed to smoke, are in contact with many health professionals, and may be more willing to accept assistance in quitting. Many smokers quit, unaided, following hospitalization. A meta-analysis found that those who receive intensive treatment during hospitalization and outpatient follow-up treatment for at least one month are more likely to quit than smokers receiving no treatment. </li>
    <li>The guideline panel for the Clinical Practice Guideline "Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update" relied on the body of evidence from the original 1996 Guideline to determine the effectiveness of physician advice to quit smoking. There were too few studies to examine advice delivered by any other type of clinician, although one study found that advice to quit from health care providers in general did significantly increase quit rates. </li>
    <li>Three separate meta-analyses were done to evaluate the effectiveness of clinician intervention on smoking abstinence rates. First, brief clinician intervention lasting about 3 minutes was compared to no intervention. This analysis showed that brief physician advice significantly increases long-term smoking abstinence rates. Patients who received physician advice to quit had an estimated abstinence rate of 10.2 as compared to those who received no advice to quit (7.9). The second analysis addressed the amount of time the clinician spent with a smoker addressing tobacco dependence in a single contact. Minimal counseling was defined as less than 3 minutes, low intensity counseling was defined as greater than 3 minutes to 10 minutes, and higher intensity counseling interventions were defined as greater than 10 minutes. All three session lengths significantly increased abstinence rates over those produced by no contact. There was a clear trend for abstinence rates to increase across the session lengths with higher intensity counseling producing the highest rates as shown below.
    <p class="Indent">No contact - Estimated odds ratio 95% CI = 1.0 - Abstinence rate 10.9 </p>
    <p class="Indent">Minimal counseling - Estimated odds ratio 95% CI = 1.3 - Abstinence rate 13.4 </p>
    <p class="Indent">Low intensity counseling - Estimated odds ratio 95% CI = 1.6 - Abstinence rate 16.0 </p>
    <p class="Indent">Higher intensity counseling - Estimated odds ratio 95% CI = 2.3 - Abstinence rate 22.1 </p>
    </li>
    <li>Another meta-analysis was also done to evaluate the effectiveness of providing counseling in addition to medication versus medication alone. The results of this 2008 meta-analysis indicate that providing counseling in addition to medication significantly enhances treatment outcomes as illustrated below:
    <p class="Indent">Medication alone - Estimated odds ratio 95% CI = 1.0 - Estimated abstinence rate = 21.7 </p>
    <p class="Indent">Medication and counseling - Estimated odds ratio 95% CI = .14 - Estimated abstinence rate =- 27.6 </p>
    </li>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Twenty-four hospitals from nineteen states volunteered to participate in a six month pilot test of the draft measures, commencing with discharges beginning March 1, 2010 and concluding on July 31, 2010. There were three tests conducted during the development phase for this measure; public comment, survey of the pilot sites, and a Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) assessment. The purpose was threefold: to gather information regarding face validity, to determine feasibility of data collection, and to gather information about each data element regarding clarity and suggested enhancement that could be made. 2,177 persons responded to the public comment. A total of eleven hospitals and eight TAP members completed the evaluation. </p>
<p>The final phase of testing consisted of site visits to a sample of participating pilot hospitals to assess the reliability of data abstracted and reported by those hospitals. Reliability test site visits were conducted at 9 randomly selected pilot hospitals. Selection of the test sites was based on multiple characteristics; including hospital demographics, populations served, bed size and type of facility. </p>
<p>All of the tobacco (TOB) measures have undergone a rigorous process of public comment, alpha testing and broad-scale pilot testing and are recognized by the field as important indicators of tobacco treatment. </p></div>
