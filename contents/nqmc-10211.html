<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of final reports for computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the chest or neck or ultrasound of the neck for patients aged 18 years and older with no known thyroid disease with a thyroid nodule less than 1.0 cm noted incidentally with follow-up imaging recommended.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Thyroid nodules are common, with estimates of prevalence as high as 50% (Mortensen, Woolner, &amp; Bennet, 1955). Desser and Kamaya (2008) found that the majority of incidentally noted thyroid nodules were benign with approximately 5% being malignant. Due to the common nature of small thyroid nodules combined with the low malignancy rate, additional follow-up is not recommended (American Thyroid Association [ATA] Guidelines Taskforce on Thyroid Nodules et al., 2009).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and other references</strong>:</p>
<p>Nonpalpable nodules detected on ultrasound (US) or other anatomic imaging studies are termed incidentally discovered nodules or "incidentalomas." Nonpalpable nodules have the same risk of malignancy as palpable nodules with the same size. Generally, only nodules greater than 1 cm should be evaluated, since they have a greater potential to be clinically significant cancers (ATA Guidelines Taskforce on Thyroid Nodules et al., 2009).</p>
<p>In patients less than 35 years with an incidental thyroid nodule (ITN) detected on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or extrathyroidal ultrasound, the Committee recommends further evaluation with dedicated thyroid ultrasound if the nodule is greater than or equal to 1 cm and has no suspicious imaging features, and if the patient has normal life expectancy.</p>
<p>In patients greater than or equal to 35 years with an ITN detected on CT, MRI, or extrathyroidal ultrasound, the Committee recommends further evaluation with dedicated thyroid ultrasound if the nodule is greater than or equal to 1.5 cm and has no suspicious imaging features, and if the patient has normal life expectancy (Hoang et al., 2014).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
As imaging technology continues to advance, the United States healthcare system has seen an increase in both the type and frequency of imaging studies being performed. The increase in utilization of imaging studies is accompanied by a corresponding increase in cost and exposure to radiation for both patients and healthcare professionals. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the number of radiologic procedures performed in the United States showed a ten-fold increase while the annual per-capita effective dose from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures increased by 600% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, the number of computerized tomographic (CT) examinations tripled, while the number of ultrasounds nearly doubled (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine, and ultrasound) accounted for approximately 35% of all imaging studies (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the proportion of radiation exposure that is attributable to medical sources increased from 17% to 53% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, while CT scans only accounted for approximately 17% of all radiologic procedures performed in the United States, they accounted for over 65% of the total effective radiation dose from radiologic procedures (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, the estimated per-capita effective radiation dose for radiologic procedures in the United States was nearly 20% higher than the average for other well-developed countries (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic imaging was prioritized as a topic area for measure development due to a high level of utilization, rising costs, and the need for measures to help promote appropriate use of imaging and improve outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
In their 2010 review of the literature, Ahmed et al. (2010) concluded that there is significant inconsistency in how incidental thyroid nodules are reported and followed up by radiologists. Given the common nature of thyroid nodules, unnecessary follow-up of these nodules can result in excessive testing and costs for patients.</p></div>
