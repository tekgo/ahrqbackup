<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 5 to 85 years of age during the measurement year who were identified as having persistent asthma and who were dispensed an asthma controller medication that they remained on for at least 75% of their treatment period.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This measure requires that separate age ranges be reported for Medicaid and Medicare product lines. For Medicaid, report only members 5 to 64 years of age.

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Appropriate medication adherence could ameliorate the severity of many asthma-related symptoms (Akinbami et al., 2009). According to the Asthma Regional Council, two-thirds of adults and children who display asthma symptoms are considered "not well controlled" or "very poorly controlled" as defined by clinical practice guidelines (Asthma Regional Council, 2010). Pharmacologic therapy is used to prevent and control asthma symptoms, improve quality of life, reduce the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations, and reverse airflow obstruction (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute &amp; National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, 2007).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Asthma is a treatable, reversible condition that affects more than 25 million people in the United States. Managing this condition with appropriate medications could save the United States billions of dollars in medical costs (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011). </li>
    <li>The United States spent approximately $56 billion on total medical costs for asthma in 2007, a 6 percent increase from 2002 (CDC, 2011). </li>
    <li>In 2010, 25.7 million Americans had asthma: 7 million children, 15.6 million adults under 65 and 3.1 million adults 65 and older (Akinbami et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Asthma is responsible for 3,000 deaths annually (American Lung Association [ALA], 2012). </li>
    <li>More than 53 percent of asthmatic patients had an asthma attack in 2008 (CDC, 2011). In 2009, there were 479,300 asthma-related hospitalizations and 1.9 million asthma related emergency room (ER) visits (CDC, 2013). </li>
    <li>The prevalence and cost of asthma have increased over the past decade, demonstrating the need for better access to care and medication. Appropriate medication management for patients with asthma could reduce the need for rescue medication&mdash;as well as the costs associated with ER visits, inpatient admissions and missed days of work or school. </li>
