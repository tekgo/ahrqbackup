Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of home health episodes of care during which the patient's surgical wound status improved.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Wound healing is a significant factor affecting the patient's ability to resume normal life activities after surgery. Surgical wound healing can be facilitated with appropriate monitoring and intervention. For patients with surgical wounds, high-quality care includes care that brings about an improvement in wound status and is an indicator of effective, high-value home health care.</p>
<p>A report on agency performance on this measure is provided to home health agencies (HHAs) as part of the Outcome-Based Quality Improvement (OBQI) Outcome Report. The OBQI reports allow the agency to compare their agency's rates in the current year compared to prior years and to national reference rates (i.e., benchmarking) values. HHAs can use the OBQI outcome measures as part of a systematic approach to continuously improving the quality of care they provide by targeting care practices that influence specific patient functioning and health status. Therefore, the measure is important to making significant gains in health care quality and improving health outcomes for a specific high impact aspect of healthcare where there is variation in performance.</p>
<p>In addition, this measure is reported on the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/HomeHealthCompare/search.aspx" title="Home Health Compare Web site" target="_blank">Medicare Home Health Compare Web site</a> providing information for consumers and their families about the quality of care provided by individual HHAs, and allowing consumers to see how well patients of one agency fare compared to other agencies and to the state and national average. The Web site presents the quality measures in consumer-friendly language and provides a tool to assist consumers in the selection of an HHA.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
One or more research studies published in a National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexed, peer-reviewed journal

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Calendar year 2007 data for 8,212 Medicare certified home health agencies were examined in terms of the level and variability of performance across agencies. For this measure, the median score on the risk-adjusted measure was 83.4 and the coefficient of variation was 21.20. These results demonstrate that room for improvement exists with respect to this quality measure. Considerable variability exists in the performance of agencies on the risk-adjusted measure, suggesting that it captures an aspect of care that is under the agency's control.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Validity</strong><br />
As part of the National Outcome-Based Quality Improvement (OBQI) Demonstration project when OASIS was originally designed and tested, several tests of validity were conducted for each OASIS item, including the items used to calculate this measure. The items passed each of the following validity assessments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Consensus validity by expert researcher/clinical panels for outcome measurement and risk factor measurement </li>
    <li>Consensus validity by expert clinical panels for patient assessment and care planning </li>
    <li>Criterion or convergent/predictive validity for outcome measurement/risk factor measurement </li>
    <li>Convergent/predictive validity: case mix adjustment for payment </li>
    <li>Validation by patient assessment and care planning </li>
    <li>Validation by outcome enhancement</li>
</ol>
<p>Descriptions for these validation assessments are contained in the accompanying descriptions taken from <em>Volume 4: OASIS Chronicle and Recommendation</em> (2001).</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong><br />
The primary reliability testing for this measure took place as part of the National OBQI Demonstration project when OASIS was originally designed and tested. In spring 1997, 41 patients from two agencies and in fall 1998, 25 patients from three different agencies were assessed by two registered nurse (RN) level assessors who were provided training on assessment methods. The results from these studies are collectively referred to as "Study 1." Study 2 was an independent inter-rater reliability study conducted by Katherine Berg of Brown University (1999) with 144 patients. Study 3 was a concurrent assessment of inter-rater reliability by Madigan, Tullai-McGinness, and Fortinsky (2001) with 88 patients from 21 agencies.</p></div>
