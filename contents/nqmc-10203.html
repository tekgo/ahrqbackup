<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Although screening mammograms can reduce breast cancer mortality by 20% to 35% in women aged 40 years and older, recent evidence shows that only 72% of women are receiving mammograms based on current guideline recommendations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). The use of patient reminders is associated with an increase in screening mammography (Sabatino et al., 2012; Gardner, Adams, &amp; Jeffreys, 2013). Encouraging the implementation of a reminder system could lead to an increase in mammography screening at appropriate intervals. </p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and other references</strong>:</p>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) recommends the use of client reminders to increase screening for breast and cervical cancers on the basis of strong evidence and effectiveness (CPSTF, 2012).</p>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years. The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take into account patient context, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms (USPSTF, 2009).</p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women between the ages of 50 and 74 years (USPSTF, 2009).</p>
<p>Indications:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Screening Mammography
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>Annually for asymptomatic women age 40 and older who are at average risk for breast cancer </li>
        <li>Asymptomatic women under age 40 who are at increased risk for breast cancer
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Woman with known mutation or genetic syndrome with increased breast cancer risk: yearly starting by age 30, but not before age 25 </li>
            <li>Untested woman with a first-degree relative with known BRCA mutation: yearly starting by age 30, but not before age 25 </li>
            <li>Woman with a 20% or greater lifetime risk for breast cancer based on breast cancer risk models: yearly starting by age 30, but not before age 25, or 10 years earlier than the age at which the youngest first-degree relative was diagnosed, whichever is later </li>
            <li>Woman with a history of chest (mantle) radiation received between the ages of 10 and 30: yearly starting 8 years after the radiation therapy, but not before age 25 </li>
            <li>Woman with biopsy-proven lobular neoplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS), invasive breast cancer, or ovarian cancer: yearly from time of diagnosis, regardless of age (American College of Radiology [ACR], 2013). </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Age at which annual mammography screening should end.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>There is no defined upper age limit at which mammography may not be beneficial. </li>
    <li>Screening with mammography should be considered as long as the patient is in good health and is willing to undergo additional testing, including biopsy, if an abnormality is detected (ACR, 2013). </li>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
As imaging technology continues to advance, the United States healthcare system has seen an increase in both the type and frequency of imaging studies being performed. The increase in utilization of imaging studies is accompanied by a corresponding increase in cost and exposure to radiation for both patients and healthcare professionals. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the number of radiologic procedures performed in the United States showed a ten-fold increase while the annual per-capita effective dose from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures increased by 600% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, the number of computerized tomographic (CT) examinations tripled, while the number of ultrasounds nearly doubled (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine, and ultrasound) accounted for approximately 35% of all imaging studies (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the proportion of radiation exposure that is attributable to medical sources increased from 17% to 53% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, while CT scans only accounted for approximately 17% of all radiologic procedures performed in the United States, they accounted for over 65% of the total effective radiation dose from radiologic procedures (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, the estimated per-capita effective radiation dose for radiologic procedures in the United States was nearly 20% higher than the average for other well-developed countries (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic imaging was prioritized as a topic area for measure development due to a high level of utilization, rising costs, and the need for measures to help promote appropriate use of imaging and improve outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
Many American women do not receive mammograms at recommended intervals, as illustrated by 2010 data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012), which found that only 72% of women reported receiving a mammogram within the recommended two-year interval. Additional factors found to reduce the likelihood for a woman to receive a mammogram include Asian race, low education status, and recent immigrant status. Low mammography use was also noted for women who reported having no regular source of medical care or having no medical insurance (CDC, 2012).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a measure testing project in 2011 with Telligen to ensure four radiology measures were reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator, and exception case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing electronic health record data and claims data. Inter-rater reliability was tested. Three sites in three states participated in the testing of the measures. All three sites were in urban settings. Site A was a group practice with 10 physicians. Site B was a hospital-based group practice with 90 physicians. Site C was a hospital-based practice with greater than 1000 physicians.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong><br />
The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from chart records were used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the measures. </p>
<p>Some of the measures in this set are being made available without any prior testing. The PCPI recognizes the importance of testing all of its measures and encourages testing of the diagnostic imaging measurement set for feasibility and reliability by organizations or individuals positioned to do so. The <em>Measure Testing Protocol for PCPI Measures</em> was approved by the PCPI in 2010 and is available on the PCPI Web site (see Position Papers at <a href="http://www.physicianconsortium.org" title="PCPI Web site">www.physicianconsortium.org</a>); interested parties are encouraged to review this document and to contact PCPI staff. The PCPI will welcome any opportunity to promote the initial testing of these measures and to ensure that any results available from testing are used to refine the measures before implementation. </p></div>
