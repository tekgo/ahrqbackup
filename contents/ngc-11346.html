<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of October 2017. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/InptHyperbili/Hyperbili.pdf%20" title="University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the original guideline document for additional information. </p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-E) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Points</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prevention</strong></p>
<p>Feed newborns, starting at birth, at least 8 times per day. Feedings should be based on feeding cues with attempts at least every 3 hours.</p>
<p>Continue breastfeeding even if feeding difficulties arise. In certain circumstances, expressed breast milk or formula supplementation may be warranted. Discourage discontinuation of breastfeeding, even for diagnostic purposes in the setting of suspected breast-milk jaundice.</p>
<p>Feeding supplementation is not indicated for sleepy neonates during first 24 to 48 hours, unless signs of dehydration, or weight loss more than the 95th percentile per the newborn weight tool (NEWT).</p>
<p>Feeding recommendations are not relevant if a patient is critically ill and enteral feeds are being withheld.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The approach to diagnosing hyperbilirubinemia will differ depending on whether it is detected via screening during the birth hospitalization (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) or later in follow-up (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). </p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>Assess all newborns for risk factors for developing hyperbilirubinemia (see Table 1 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Bilirubin Measurement</strong></p>
<p>A total bilirubin (total serum bilirubin [TSB] or transcutaneous bilirubin [TcB]) level should be measured on all newborns prior to discharge <em>[I-C]</em>.</p>
<p>Choose appropriate test for bilirubin levels (see Table 5 in the original guideline document) </p>
<p>If TSB is indicated, the first level should be fractionated to rule out direct hyperbilirubinemia. Subsequent measurements can be total bilirubin alone. </p>
<p>The first measurement should be obtained at 16 to 24 hours of life <em>[I-C]</em>. </p>
<p>Discharge prior to 16 hours of life is strongly discouraged. If extenuating circumstances result in the discharge of a neonate prior to 16 hours of life, appropriate follow-up for evaluation of hyperbilirubinemia should be arranged. </p>
<p>Total bilirubin levels should be plotted on the hour-specific nomogram to direct follow up (see Figures 4 and 5 in the original guideline document). If point of care (POC) bilirubin is obtained in the outpatient setting, consider that serum measurements can be 10% higher when interpreting the results. </p>
<p><strong>Further Investigation into Underlying Etiology</strong></p>
<p>Investigation into rarer causes of hyperbilirubinemia is recommended in certain circumstances (see Table 4 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Risk Stratification</strong></p>
<p>Use risk stratification (lower, medium, or higher risk ([see Table 3 in the original guideline document]) to determine phototherapy and exchange-transfusion thresholds. To risk stratify, combine gestational age (GA) with presence of neurotoxicity risk factors (see Table 1 in the original guideline document) <em>[I-D]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For overview, see Figure 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Decision to admit to the hospital and treat should be based on TSB <em>[I-D]</em>.</p>
<p>Intensive phototherapy can be expected to decrease bilirubin levels by 30% to 40% in 24 hours, with most being in the first 4 to 6 hours. Intensive phototherapy should be initiated in the following circumstances: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>When total bilirubin is at or above the phototherapy treatment threshold based on hour-specific nomograms (see Figure 4 in the original guideline document) </li>
    <li>When TSB rate of rise is greater than 0.2 mg/dL/hour and TSB is predicted to cross treatment threshold prior to next evaluation <em>[I-D]</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>There is lack of evidence to support the routine use of home phototherapy when the bilirubin level is at, near, or above the treatment threshold. However, home phototherapy can be considered when bilirubin is 0-2 mg/dL below the treatment threshold at discharge from the birth hospitalization or in the outpatient setting in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Neonates who feed well, appear well, and have close follow up arranged </li>
    <li>Neonates with <strong>no</strong> neurotoxicity risk factors (low risk or medium risk based on gestational age alone) <em>[III-C]</em> </li>
    <li>Neonates without prior history of intensive phototherapy treatment </li>
</ul>
<p>When bilirubin values are at or near exchange transfusion values:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Maximize surface area exposed to phototherapy by removing unnecessary clothing (minimal/no diaper) </li>
    <li>Use highly reflective materials to surround the neonate to increase surface area exposed and irradiance </li>
    <li>Use multiple light sources (measure irradiance at various sites) </li>
    <li>Consider adjunctive therapies, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and IV hydration </li>
    <li>Notably, turning baby from prone to supine in an alternating fashion has <strong>not</strong> been shown to be efficacious </li>
</ul>
<p>For most neonates, routine <strong>IV supplementation</strong> is <strong>not</strong> warranted. However, for neonates with severe hyperbilirubinemia, IV fluid administration may be useful and is recommended.</p>
<p>Use of <strong>IVIG</strong> may be useful in Rh or ABO disease.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Use should be restricted to select neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with high bilirubin values or rapid rate of rise (at high risk for exchange transfusion). </li>
    <li>Neonates should be monitored closely. </li>
    <li>Dose 0.5g/kg over 2 hours, repeat as clinically indicated. </li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>exchange transfusion</strong> should be considered when a serum bilirubin value surpasses the applicable American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended threshold value (see Figure 5 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>Following the initiation of phototherapy, only serum bilirubin (TSB) levels are recommended. </p>
<p>Stop phototherapy once serum bilirubin has fallen to a level at least 3 mg/dL below the phototherapy threshold. </p>
<p>Rebound levels at 6 hours are not predictive of subsequent repeat phototherapy. </p>
<p>If treated prior to initial hospitalization discharge (post-delivery), consider repeat TSB 24 hours after discontinuation of phototherapy. This can be done as an outpatient. </p>
<p>If preterm, direct antiglobulin test (DAT)+, or treated after readmission and serum bilirubin is <strong>greater</strong> than 14, recheck TSB 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of phototherapy. This can be done as an outpatient. (If bilirubin is &le;14, routine repeat TSB is not indicated in all neonates.) </p>
<p>When treating with exchange transfusion, recheck bilirubin every 4 to 6 hours, depending on the rate of decline. </p>
<p>A neonate being treated with home phototherapy (fiber optic blanket, Bili Blanket) should have a TSB checked:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Every 24 to 48 hours if the neonate is low risk </li>
    <li>Every 24 hours if the neonate is medium risk and has no neurotoxicity risk factors </li>
</ul>
<p>Discharge should not be delayed to obtain a rebound bilirubin level. Rebound levels can be checked as an outpatient when indicated.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up</strong></p>
<p>Timing and frequency of follow up after birth hospitalization should be influenced by risk of development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. This can be determined by risk factors for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia (see Table 2 in the original guideline document) as well as plotting TcB or TSB on the Bhutani nomogram (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For those at higher risk, follow up should occur 1 day following birth hospitalization discharge </li>
</ul>
<p>After hospital discharge from phototherapy, primary care physician (PCP) follow-up should be arranged within 24 hours, or 48 hours when no serum bilirubin recheck is required (i.e., discharge bilirubin &lt;14).</p>
<p><strong>Phototherapy Techniques</strong></p>
<p><em>Fiberoptic Phototherapy Blanket</em></p>
<p>The fiber optic blanket should be applied next to the neonate's skin. The neonate may wear a diaper. The parents should swaddle the neonate with the fiber optic blanket next to the skin to avoid hypothermia. Feeding can continue with the blanket next to the neonate's skin. If necessary, to optimize feeding, the neonate may be removed from the blanket for up to 30 minutes every 2 to 3 hours. </p>
<p><em>Inpatient Phototherapy</em></p>
<p>Babies receiving inpatient phototherapy should receive "intensive" phototherapy <em>[I-C]</em>.</p>
<p>For the majority of term neonates, phototherapy using a single overhead LED light source will provide intensive phototherapy and will be sufficient. </p>
<p>Phototherapy using a single overhead LED light source and fiberoptic blanket may be indicated when the serum bilirubin value is:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Rising more than 0.5 mg/dl/hour </li>
    <li>Within 3 mg/dl below the exchange transfusion threshold </li>
    <li>Fails to respond to initial phototherapy </li>
</ul>
<p>Use of 2 angled overhead lights, a fiberoptic blanket, and white sheets as a reflective surface may be indicated when bilirubin is at or above the exchange transfusion threshold. This is done in the NICU.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Body surface area exposed and continuity of therapy (i.e., minimizing interruptions) will influence efficacy. </li>
    <li>Irradiance should be measured regularly. </li>
    <li>There is a lack of evidence to support the use of fiberoptic blanket alone. </li>
    <li>When neonates are not considered high risk for exchange transfusion, phototherapy can be temporarily halted to allow for bonding and breastfeeding. </li>

<p>Within the Medline (Ovid) database, the following search strategy was used. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>exp *hyperbilirubinemia, neonatal/ </li>
    <li>*hyperbilirubinemia/ or *jaundice/ or *kernicterus/ </li>

    <li>limit 8 to (english language and yr="2004 -Current") </li>
</ol>
<p>The search was not focused on indirect hyperbilirubinemia because the retrieval was very small. The Main search retrieved 1,213 references. When the search hedges for Guidelines, Clinical Trials, and Cohort Studies were added, the base results are as follow: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia - Guidelines, total results were 35 </li>
    <li>Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia - Clinical Trials, total results were 125 </li>
    <li>Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia - Cohort Studies, total results were 262 </li>
</ul>
<p>The MEDLINE In-Process database was also searched using the strategy in the methodological appendix (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The search retrieved 100 documents. The results with the hedges applied are: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Guidelines, total results were 2 </li>
    <li>Clinical Trials, total results were 11 </li>
    <li>Cohort Studies, total results were 21 </li>
</ul>
<p>Within the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 6 reviews were found using the strategy in the search strategies document. The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during first 6 months of life, as all-cause mortality is less in exclusive breast fed neonates. </li>
    <li>Compared with selective testing, universal screening reduces total blood draws and phototherapy rates. </li>
    <li>Intensive phototherapy can be expected to decrease bilirubin levels by 30% to 40% in 24 hours, with most being in the first 4 to 6 hours. Phototherapy is in general effective at decreasing serum bilirubin values (TSB) and preventing the need for exchange transfusion. </li>
    <li>A randomized controlled trial (RCT) found supplementing with intravenous (IV) fluids for the first 8 hours of phototherapy followed by enteral supplementation was associated with fewer exchange transfusions. Another RCT of 100 well appearing neonates found the mean decrease in transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) at 24 hours of phototherapy was greater with IV supplementation. </li>
    <li>A single RCT showed the use of albumin priming prior to exchange transfusion (1 mg/kg, 1 hour before exchange transfusion) resulted in lower TBS values at 12 hours and a shorter length of stay for neonates receiving albumin. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Exclusive breastfeeding is strongly associated with an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia, however, the hyperbilirubinemia appears to be primarily the result of less effective breastfeeding. </li>
    <li>Though there is a paucity of evidence phototherapy has risk, melanocytic nevus development is a worry. Blue light can induce retinal photoreceptor degeneration in rats and in mammals. </li>
    <li>Potential adverse sequelae of exchange transfusion include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, and bacteremia. </li>
    <li>False negative and false positive results of tests </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Home phototherapy should not be used in neonates with neurotoxicity risk factors, nor those who have required intensive phototherapy. </li>
    <li>Do not use transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) if phototherapy has been initiated. </li>
</ul>
