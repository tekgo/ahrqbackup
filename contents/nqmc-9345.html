Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of home health stays in which patients used the emergency department but were not admitted to the hospital during the 60 days following the start of the home health stay.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Within home health care, 10.2% of patients utilize the emergency department (ED), but are not hospitalized during the first 60 days of home health.</p>
<p>There is evidence that there are interventions that can be effective in reducing ED use. While there are many single studies reporting the effectiveness of telehealth, we are reporting here from selected systematic reviews that are most relevant to home health care patients. Specifically, for patients with heart failure, in a systematic review, telehealth has been found to overall reduce ED visits (although the results were not consistent with nine studies finding a beneficial effect, one study finding no difference and one study finding more visits in the telehealth group) (Polisena et al., 2010). In a systematic review of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, there was evidence that telephone support (using regular telephonic care) reduced ED visits in one study. None of the other studies reported on ED use for patients with COPD (Bourbeau et al., 2003). For patients with diabetes, in a systematic review, the results are mixed with two studies showing a beneficial effect with telehealth and one study finding more ED visits among those in the telemonitoring group (Polisena et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Benefits of this measure include opportunities for identification of inappropriately high ED use and encouragement of agencies to implement interventions that reduce inappropriate ED use, leading to improvement in the health of Medicare beneficiaries and lowering Medicare costs.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong><br />
All agencies with at least 20 home health stays beginning between 1/1/2010 and 12/31/2010 were included in the reliability analysis, because only information for agencies with at least 20 episodes is publicly reported. Of the 10,125 agencies with any home health stays in 2010, 8,567 agencies met the threshold for the "Emergency Department Use without Hospitalization" measure. For the national analysis, a beta-binomial distribution was fitted using all agencies. For the hospital referral region (HRR) analysis, separate beta-binomials were fitted for each of 306 HRRs, using only those agencies in the HRR. It is worth noting that even the agencies that are in HRRs with only two agencies have high reliability scores, because these small HRR agencies tend to service many home health patients relative to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Reliability analysis of this measure follows the beta-binomial method described in "The Reliability of Provider Profiling: A Tutorial" by John L. Adams.</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em><br />
The distribution of national reliability scores (percent of variance due to the difference in measure score among providers at the national level) shows that the majority of agencies have a reliability score greater than 0.818, implying that their performance can likely be distinguished from other agencies (i.e., performance on this measure is unlikely to be due to measurement error or insufficient sample size, but is instead due to true differences between the agency and other agencies as it substantially exceeds within agency variation).</p>
<p>The distribution of HRR reliability scores (percent of variance due to the difference in measure score among providers at the HRR level) for this measure also shows that at least 50% of agencies have a reliability score greater than 0.709, suggesting that between agency variation substantially exceeds within agency variation even at the HRR level.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong><br />
Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) chose to respecify the "Emergency Department Use without Hospitalization" measure with Medicare claims data to enhance the validity and reliability of this measure. The measure population is limited to fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries, ensuring that Medicare claims are filed for emergency department services the beneficiary receives. The measure numerator is a broad measure of utilization (emergency department use) that can be cleanly identified using claims data. Because claims form the basis of Medicare payments, CMS invests significant resources in validating claims submissions prior to payment.</p>
<p>As CMS audits a sample of claims for Part B services (including outpatient emergency department visits) as part of annual payment error calculations, additional validity testing of measure elements has not been conducted. The annual payment error calculation for 2010 involved a sample of Medicare claims that were then compared to medical records and included 31,766 claims Part B (and an additional 2,454 claims for acute inpatient hospitalizations).</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em><br />
Of the sampled Part B claims, the patient record could not be found for 801 (or 0.2%) claims. It is possible that an extremely small fraction of claims represent care that did not occur, but this problem is clearly not widespread. 12.9% had some type of payment error with the bulk of these errors coming from insufficient documentation. It is possible that in some of these cases, reviewers could not determine that emergency department services were utilized or were medically necessary. While the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) report calculates the fraction of claims impacted by payment errors only for broad categories of payments and not by clinical setting, it does project the amount of improper payments by both type of error and clinical setting. The report estimates that $1.97 billion of improper payments to hospital outpatient departments resulted from insufficient documentation and $2.64 billion in payment errors resulted from any cause. For comparison, in 2009, total Medicare spending on hospital outpatient services was $34 billion. Thus errors impact only 7.7% of hospital outpatient payments.</p></div>
