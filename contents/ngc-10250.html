<p><strong>Staging</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Complete resection, including muscularis propria, is recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risk Stratification</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Low risk: solitary, primary, low grade pTa </li>
    <li>Intermediate risk: multiple or recurrent, large, low grade pTa </li>
    <li>High risk: any &gt;pTa, carcinoma in situ (CIS), &gt;low grade </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adjuvant Therapy</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Post-transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) chemotherapy is recommended for all risk categories of pTa patients, especially for low risk patients, as these patients benefit most in terms of recurrence rates at 2 years. </li>
    <li>The standard of care is adjuvant-immediate chemotherapy instillation post-TUR, unless the bladder is perforated with TUR or if there is a significant risk of vesico-ureteral reflux. Chemotherapy should consist of: epirubicin (100 mg/100 mL) or mitomycin C (MMC; 40 mg/40 mL weekly x 8 weeks then monthly for a year). </li>
    <li>If there is a recurrence, repeat TUR and consider proceeding to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Induction and Maintenance Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Induction and maintenance therapy is recommended for intermediate and high risk patients, including those with multifocal tumours or frequent recurrences.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>BCG: induction therapy for 4 to 6 weeks then 3-weekly injections at 3-month intervals; continue for 12 to 24 months, if patient is disease-free at 3 months. Therapy may be continued at 30 and 36 months, at which time a clinical decision should be made as to whether or not to proceed with maintenance. </li>
    <li>MMC: 40 mg/mL monthly; continue for 12 to 24 months. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second-line Treatment for Ta BCG Failure</strong></p>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (Patient or Population, Intervention, Comparisons, Outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What is the appropriate primary therapy for patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer? </li>
    <li>Which patients are appropriate for adjuvant therapy? </li>
    <li>Which agents are most efficacious in preventing bladder tumour recurrences? </li>
    <li>What is the appropriate dosing and duration of adjuvant therapy? </li>
    <li>How often are follow-up examinations required and for what duration? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>An original guideline on bladder cancer was developed in 2005 and then updated in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The document contained recommendations and evidence on both noninvasive disease and invasive disease. In 2013 the guideline was divided into 2 distinct documents: a guideline on noninvasive disease (GU-009) and a guideline on muscle-invasive and locally advanced or unresectable/metastatic disease (GU-002). The guideline on noninvasive disease includes an update of the original search strategy and recommendations, but incorporates a new literature search and more in-depth recommendations on bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy. The original literature search included the Medline and EMBASE databases. The search term <em>bladder cancer</em> was used and results were limited to clinical trials, randomized controlled trials (RCT), and phase III studies. A total of nine citations identified from the original search were relevant to the updated noninvasive bladder cancer guideline.</p>
<p>The search for literature on adjuvant BCG therapy included the PubMed database only, which was searched for relevant literature published between 1993 and 2013 May 28. The search terms <em>urothelial carcinoma</em> or <em>transitional cell carcinoma</em> or <em>bladder cancer</em> AND <em>bacillus calmette guerin</em> were used and results limited to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and phase III clinical trials conducted in humans and published in English. The search initially returned 105 citations; further exclusion criteria included studies that did not examine the efficacy of BCG or interventions for BCG toxicity as primary endpoints, studies on prognostic factors only, studies with less than 50 patients in total, older (pre-2000) studies examining toxicity reduction strategies, older (pre-2000) studies comparing a new treatment with BCG as the established standard, as well as previous versions of a Cochrane review, meta-analyses older than 2006 May, phase II trials, retrospective analyses of single RCT data, reviews, and in vitro studies. After applying the exclusion criteria, a total of 60 citations remained and were included in the literature review.</p>
<p>In addition, the National Guideline Clearinghouse database was searched for relevant guidelines published between 2008 and 2013 June 3. The single search term <em>bacillus calmette guerin</em> was used. The search returned 3 relevant guidelines from the European Association of Urology, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and the American Urological Association. Two additional guidelines were identified on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Web site and the Canadian Urology Association Web site. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging definitions for bladder cancer was also included as a reference document.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Genitourinary Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Genitourinary Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
