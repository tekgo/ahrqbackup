Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The primary search is up to date as of July 26, 2012. Published literature was retrieved via searching the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (1946 to July Week 3, 2012) with in-process records and other non-indexed citations and daily updates via Ovid (July 25, 2012); EMBASE (1980 to Week 29, 2012) via Ovid; and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, Issue 7) via Ovid. Terms used were related to AML (acute myeloid leukemia OR acute myelogenous leukemia OR acute myelocytic leukemia) and DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase 3A OR DNA [cytosine-5]-methyltransferase 3A human OR DNMT3A protein).</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria and Protocol</strong></p>
<p>Studies must have included cytogenetically normal (CN) patients stratified to the intermediate-risk group. Pediatric AML was not included for analysis (&lt;15 years of age); no upper age limit was specified. Comparators under investigation were normal cytogenetic risk groups defined with the DNMT3A mutation versus normal cytogenetic risk groups without the DNMT3A mutation (wild type). The exact nature of the treatment administered was not of primary interest but was documented if the study provided the information. Primary outcomes of interest include overall survival (OS), complete remission (CR), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and relapse-free survival (RFS). Co-occurring molecular aberrations, along with where the mutation was located in the gene, were documented for further research. Inclusion criteria encompassed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical practice guidelines, randomized control trials, cohort studies (prospective and retrospective) or case-control studies with an analysis or subgroup analysis of DNMT3A biomarker status and investigated DNMT3A in patients with previously treated or untreated AML. Exclusion criteria was applied to articles published in a language other than English, were non-systematic reviews, letters, editorials, commentaries, or historical articles, or if patients had secondary AML.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Data Extraction and Assessment of Study Quality and Potential for Bias</strong></p>
<p>One reviewer went through the various databases that were mentioned in the search strategy (see the "Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence" field) to identify relevant guidelines and articles. The same reviewer conducted title and abstract screening, and duplicates were removed. For each eligible study, the same reviewer would extract all the study data (including study design features, patient population, interventions, molecular exons sequenced and analyzed, co-occurring molecular aberrations with deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] methyltransferase 3A [DNMT3A], and clinical outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Synthesizing the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>When clinically homogenous results from two or more trials were available, a meta-analysis would be conducted using the Review Manager software. For time-to-event outcomes, hazard ratios (HRs), rather than the number of events at a certain time point, would be the preferred statistic for meta-analysis, and would be used as reported. If the HR and/or its standard error were not reported, they would be derived from other information reported in the study, if possible, using the methods described by Parmar et al., 1998. For all outcomes, the generic inverse variance model with random effects, or other appropriate random effects models in Review Manager, would be used.</p>
<p>Statistical heterogeneity would be calculated using the &chi;<sup>2</sup> test for heterogeneity and the I<sup>2</sup> percentage. A probability level for the &chi;<sup>2</sup> statistic less than or equal to 10% (p&le;0.10) and/or an I<sup>2</sup> greater than 50% would be considered indicative of statistical heterogeneity.</p>
<p><em>Meta-analysis</em></p>
<p>The response data from six of the eight studies were pooled for a meta-analysis. See Figure 1 in the original guideline document for forest plot of effect size for overall survival.</p></div>
