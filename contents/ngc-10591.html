<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Genetic Test Interpretation</span></strong></p>
<p>The <em>G6PD</em> gene is on the X chromosome (Xq28;ref.2). Genotype results associated with G6PD deficiency may be reported as (i) hemizygous male (e.g., one class I&ndash;III variant allele), (ii) homozygous female (two identical deficient class I&ndash;III alleles with the same variant), (iii) compound heterozygous female (two different deficient class I&ndash;III alleles with different variants), and (iv) heterozygous female (one normal class IV allele and one deficient class I&ndash;III allele) (Table 1, below). The known inactivating or low-function variants (class I, II, and III variants) are provided in Supplementary Table S1 online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). If these variants are present, they may be interpreted as defined in Table 1, below, and in some cases a diagnosis of G6PD deficiency can be made on the basis of genotypic results. Hemizygous males, homozygous females, and compound heterozygous females are classified as either G6PD deficient or G6PD deficient with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) (Table 1, below). For the rare male patients who have an extra X chromosome (i.e., Klinefelter's syndrome), <em>G6PD</em> genotype should be interpreted as if they are females.</p>
<p>Determining G6PD phenotype in heterozygous females (one normal class IV allele and one deficient class I&ndash;III allele) is not possible based on genetic testing alone due to X-linked chromosome inactivation in females. This X-chromosome inactivation, which can happen in a variable percentage of somatic cells, inactivates either the normal or the low-activity allele and translates into heterozygous females having a mosaic of G6PD-normal and G6PD-deficient erythrocytes. The resulting overall enzyme activity will be variable because the ratio of the two types of red cells is highly variable and can change over time in the same individual. Thus, G6PD activity in heterozygous females can potentially go the full range from being normal to being G6PD deficient, and thus heterozygotes may display a drug-induced acute hemolytic anemia (AHA) profile similar to that of homozygotes (see the Supplementary Material online [<em>G6PD</em> Heterozygotes section] [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Thus, an enzyme activity test is needed to assign G6PD phenotype in heterozygous females.</p>
<p>Because most genetic tests do not comprehensively interrogate all variants associated with G6PD deficiency and because the phenotype of genotypically proven heterozygous females is unpredictable, most diagnoses of G6PD deficiency are currently made via tests of enzyme activity rather than genotype. In males, the results of G6PD enzyme activity are usually clear cut, including in newborns, who tend to have higher activity than that observed in older children and adults. The primary risk of misclassification in males is when there has been recent hemolysis (because G6PD in reticulocytes and in young erythrocytes is higher) or recent blood transfusion (because the transfused blood is likely to be G6PD normal); either or both may shift a G6PD-deficient enzyme level near to or even within the normal range. In females, there may be overlap in activity between G6PD homozygous normal and heterozygotes and between heterozygotes and homozygous deficient; there may be also more intrasubject variability in G6PD activity than in males (see the Supplementary Material online [<em>G6PD</em> Heterozygotes section] [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Universal neonatal screening programs for G6PD deficiency via the use of semiquantitative fluorescent spot test or quantitative enzyme activity assay have been instituted or proposed in areas with a high incidence of G6PD deficiency such as Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field] for frequencies in major racial/ethnic groups).</p>

<p class="Note">CNSHA, chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia; WHO, World Health Organization.</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>a</sup>WHO classifications from reference 14, other details from reference 17 in the original guideline document. Class I variants are extremely rare; the distinction between class II and III variants is not clear, and the "class V" very high activity variant has been reported in only a single case. Therefore, almost all patients will carry class II, III, or IV alleles. It should be noted that the class of a variant may have been assigned only by the clinical manifestations of a patient in which the variant was subsequently identified.</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>b</sup>Due to the large number of <em>G6PD</em> variants, many other diplotypes may be possible besides those given as examples here; see Supplementary Table S1 online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for a more comprehensive list of variant alleles with their assigned WHO class.</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>c</sup>Due to X-linked mosaicism, females heterozygous for one nondeficient (class IV) and one deficient (class I&ndash;III variants) allele may display a normal or a deficient phenotype. It is therefore difficult to predict the phenotype of these individuals (Supplementary Material online [<em>G6PD</em> Heterozygotes section]).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therapeutic Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Rasburicase use is contraindicated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in those with G6PD deficiency (see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the original guideline document). If, on the basis of genotyping, a deficient status can be unambiguously assigned to a patient, that would be a sufficient contraindication to the use of rasburicase. However, due to the limitations of genetic testing, in most cases it is necessary to perform G6PD enzyme testing to assign G6PD status at this time.</p>
<p>The FDA recommends that patients at higher risk of G6PD deficiency, such as those with African or Mediterranean ancestry, be tested for G6PD deficiency before initiation of rasburicase. However, it should be noted that patients of all ancestries may be G6PD deficient. The drug labels do not specifically mention genetic testing, but with the increased availability of genetic test results some patients may be diagnosed with G6PD deficiency preemptively; if so, such definitive results could be used to preclude prescribing of rasburicase and potentially other oxidative drugs even in the absence of G6PD enzyme activity results.</p>
<p><strong>Pediatrics</strong></p>
<p>Much of the evidence relating G6PD deficiency to rasburicase-induced hemolysis and methemoglobinemia was generated in neonates or children (see Supplementary Table S7 online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]), and thus these guidelines apply to neonates, children, and adults.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for Incidental Findings</span></strong></p>
<p>Patients with G6PD deficiency should be advised that they are at an increased risk of hemolysis after exposure to fava beans or to high-risk drugs or chemicals (Supplementary Table S6 online), and that it is recommended to avoid such compounds (see the Supplementary Material online [Unsafe Drugs for G6PD Deficient Patients section] and Supplementary Table S6 online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision making, as well as to identify questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for all individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the health-care provider to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made solely by the clinician and the patient. CPIC assumes no responsibility for any injury to persons or damage to property related to any use of CPIC's guidelines or for any errors or omissions.</p>
<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations for the testing of other genetic markers are beyond the scope of this guideline. Agents known to induce or inhibit glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) expression may also influence the risk of rasburicase-induced hemolysis. Variation in the pharmacokinetics of rasburicase and dosage prescribed could also affect risk.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<p>Several commercially available genetic tests screen only for some of the more common G6PD genetic variants. Therefore, any patient could have a rare, different, or previously unknown genetic variant; thus, a genetic test may have been reported as "negative," but the patient could nonetheless have G6PD deficiency.</p></div>
