Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Bipolar Disorder and Risk of Suicide</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Unipolar depression and bipolar disorder are associated with a significant risk of suicide. The risk of completed suicide is higher in bipolar disorder than in unipolar depression. </li>
    <li>Patients with bipolar disorder are at high risk for suicide; rates as high as 80% of patients with bipolar disorder have been reported with either suicidal ideation or suicide attempts. </li>
    <li>Suicide completion rates in patients with bipolar I disorder have been reported as high as 10-15% with some studies reporting higher rates in patients with bipolar II disorder. </li>
    <li>Among the phases of bipolar disorder, depression is associated with the highest suicide risk, followed by mixed states and presence of psychotic symptoms with episodes of mania being least associated with suicide. </li>
    <li>Data from a large study reporting systematic treatment enhancement program for bipolar disorder (STEP-BD) baseline data identified that of patients with bipolar disorder, 60% had a history of prior suicide attempts and that this finding was consistent with other large studies that show a strong association between prior history of suicide attempts and new attempts or completed suicide in patients with bipolar disorder. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessing Risk of Suicide</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>All patients should be asked about suicidal ideation, intention to act on these ideas, and extent of plans or preparation for suicide. </li>
</ul></div>
