<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level 30-day risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date for the index admission. A specified set of planned readmissions do not count as readmissions. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Hospital readmission rates reflect quality and efficiency of care. Readmission of patients who were recently discharged after hospitalization with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represents an important, expensive, and often preventable adverse outcome. The risk of readmission can be modified by the quality and type of care provided to these patients. Improving readmission rates is the joint responsibility of hospitals and clinicians. Measuring readmission will create incentives to invest in interventions to improve hospital care, better assess the readiness of patients for discharge, and facilitate transitions to outpatient status.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Many care processes can influence readmission risk. In general, randomized controlled trials have shown that improvement in the following areas can directly reduce readmission rates: quality of care during the initial admission; improvement in communication with patients, their caregivers and their clinicians; patient education; predischarge assessment; and coordination of care after discharge. Evidence that hospitals have been able to reduce readmission rates through these quality-of-care initiatives illustrates the degree to which hospital practices can affect readmission rates. Successful randomized trials have reduced 30-day readmission rates by 20% to 40% (Jack et al., 2009; Coleman et al., 2004; Courtney et al., 2009; Garasen, Windspoll, &amp; Johnsen, 2007; Koehler et al., 2009; Mistiaen, Francke, &amp; Poot, 2007; Naylor et al., 1994; Naylor et al., 1999; van Walraven et al., 2002; Weiss, Yakusheva, &amp; Bobay, 2010; Krumholz et al., 2002). The Project RED (Re-Engineered Discharge) intervention, in which a nurse was assigned to each patient as a discharge advocate, responsible for patient education, follow-up, medication reconciliation, and preparing individualized discharge instructions sent to the patient's primary care provider and there was a follow-up phone call from a pharmacist within 4 days of discharge demonstrated a 30% reduction in 30-day readmissions (Jack et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Specific interventions among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) that have been shown to significantly reduce the rate of readmission include disease management programs that involved home visits by cardiac-trained nurses, standardized checklists, communication with physicians, and patient education (Young et al., 2003). Similarly, in observational studies, enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation programs has been found to be associated with significant reductions in readmission after AMI (Mudrick et al., 2013). </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models</strong></p>
<p>The acute myocardial infarction (AMI) readmission measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year.</p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero. </p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.2 of the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><strong>AMI Readmission 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of AMI Model Variables </em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>An increase in History of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (11.9% to 14.1%) </li>
    <li>A decrease in Coronary atherosclerosis/other chronic ischemic heart disease (87.1% to 84.8%) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>AMI Model Parameters and Performance </em></p>
<p>Table 4.2.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.2.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the AMI readmission model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic increased slightly from 0.65 to 0.66. </p>

The measure assesses unplanned readmissions, from any cause, within 30 days from the date of a discharge from an index acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admission. Only an unplanned inpatient admission to a short-term acute care hospital can quality as a readmission.</p>
<p>If a patient has more than one unplanned admission within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, only the first is considered a readmission. The measures assess a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has any unplanned readmission within 30 days. If the first readmission after discharge is planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not considered in the outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.</p>
<p>The risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of "predicted" readmissions to the number of "expected" readmissions at a given hospital, multiplied by the national observed readmission rate. For each hospital, the numerator of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted based on the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.</p>

Admissions identified as planned by the planned readmissions algorithm are not counted as readmissions. The planned readmission algorithm is a set of criteria for classifying readmissions and planned among the general Medicare population using Medicare administrative claims data. The algorithm identifies admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. </p>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm has three fundamental principles: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>
    <li>Otherwise, a planned readmission is defined as a non-acute readmission for a scheduled procedure; and </li>
    <li>Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned </li>
</ol>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm uses a flow chart and four tables of specific procedure categories and discharge diagnosis categories to classify readmissions as planned. The flow chart and tables are available in the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?cid=1219069855841&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;c=Page" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 Condition-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures</a></em>. </p></div>

Description of Allowance for Patient or Population Factors

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measures to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) readmission rates are higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission.</p></div>
