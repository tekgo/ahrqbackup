Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percent of encounters where the wait time for an interpreter is 15 minutes or less.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patients and providers report resistance or reluctance to using interpreter services due to long wait times or delays in obtaining an interpreter upon request. As interpreter services continue to evolve, many hospitals across the country have adopted standards for wait times for interpreter encounters. This measure provides information on the extent to which interpreter services are able to respond to requests for service within a reasonable amount of time, defined here as within 15 minutes.</p></div>

Costs

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Physicians who are unable to communicate effectively with their patients often compensate by engaging in costly practices such as: more diagnostic procedures; more invasive procedures; overprescribing medications. </li>
    <li>Language barrier between physicians and their patients are associated with a $38 increase in test charges and 20-minute longer emergency department (ED) stay. </li>
    <li>ED decision making behavior (e.g., diagnostic testing, admission, IV hydration) is more costly when non-English speaking patients did not receive care from bilingual physician or with an interpreter present. </li>
    <li>The average cost per interpretation for health maintenance organizations (HMOs) patients was $79 and the total cost per year was $279, a relatively small cost given total medical expenditures, and given improved patient utilization of preventive and primary care services that may reduce long-term medical costs. </li>

Ten (10) hospitals reported data monthly on 40,000 - 60,000 patients seen in inpatient and ambulatory care settings. Hospitals ranged in size from 11,500 - 44,000 admissions, included 2 children's hospitals and were comprised of both academic teaching and non-teaching community hospitals. </p>
