<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>How much care costs is an important consideration when choosing a health plan. There is a great demand for information to help purchasers and consumers determine which organizations offer the highest quality services, along with effective management of those services and low premium or out-of-pocket costs.</p>
<p>HEDIS 2016 includes five measures of relative resource use (RRU) for members with specific chronic and acute conditions: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Relative Resource Use for People with Diabetes (RDI) </li>
    <li>Relative Resource Use for People with Cardiovascular Conditions (RCA) </li>
    <li>Relative Resource Use for People with Hypertension (RHY) </li>
    <li>Relative Resource Use for People with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (RCO) </li>
    <li>Relative Resource Use for People with Asthma (RAS) </li>
</ol>
<p>The measures are a standardized approach to measuring resource use. When evaluated with the corresponding Quality of Care measures, they provide more information about the efficiency or value of services rendered by an organization.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure
</h2>
<div class='field field_picklist-choice'>
<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>"Relative resource use (RRU)" measures indicate how health plans use health care resources (e.g., doctor visits, hospital stays, surgical procedures, medications), compared with other plans at the national and regional levels, and adjusted for their patient population. When combined with HEDIS quality measures, RRU measures reveal value by relating use of health care services to quality. </li>
    <li>The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) collects RRU data for five chronic conditions that account for a major portion of all health spending: asthma, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes and hypertension. RRU measures help purchasers identify health plans that deliver high-quality care, while managing associated resources. </li>
    <li>To allow fair comparison of plans, RRU measures feature risk adjustment and price standardization of services. The goal of risk adjustment is to eliminate sources of variation (e.g., age, gender, serious health conditions) that neither health plans nor providers can control. Standardized prices are assigned to each unit of service delivered to patients, covered by health plans and reported by service category (i.e., inpatient hospital care, evaluation and management, surgery and other procedures, diagnostic lab and imaging, prescription drugs) for each condition. </li>
    <li>Purchasers should be most interested in plans that are high in quality and low in resource use.</li>
    <li>Understanding the value of these measures requires both cost and quality information, therefore, quality and resource use should both be considered when reviewing the results from health plans. </li>
</ul>

Extent of Measure Testing

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>All HEDIS measures undergo systematic assessment of face validity with review by measurement advisory panels, expert panels, a formal public comment process and approval by the National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement and Board of Directors. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test. All measures undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomial statistical analysis.</p></div>
