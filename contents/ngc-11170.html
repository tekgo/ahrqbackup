Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of May 2016. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/InptCOPD/COPD.final.pdf" title="University of Michigan Health System Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the original guideline document for additional information.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Points</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is usually made by a clinical assessment that combines historical features, identification of triggers of worsening disease, physical exam findings and ruling out other conditions with similar clinical presentations. </li>
    <li>Testing should include a complete blood count (CBC), a chest x-ray (CXR), influenza nasal swab (seasonal), and an electrocardiogram (ECG) in most patients. Additional testing is indicated when an alternate condition is suspected <em>[I, D]. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment of Severity and Intensity of Care</strong></p>
<p>The early evaluation for patients with COPD should identify patients that will require hospitalization, ventilatory support, or intensive care unit (ICU) admission (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) <em>[I, D]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Inhaled bronchodilators
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Patients hospitalized with AECOPD should be treated with inhaled albuterol and/or ipratropium, with dose and frequency titrated to effect (see Table 3 in the original guideline document for COPD treatment modalities) <em>[I, C]</em>. </li>
        <li>Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), with spacer devices, are the preferred delivery method for short-acting bronchodilators, unless the patient's condition or preference warrants the use of a nebulizer. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Corticosteroids
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Most patients who are hospitalized with an exacerbation of COPD should be treated with systemic corticosteroids, unless side-effects are limiting <em>[I, A]</em>. </li>
        <li>A dose of prednisone, 40 mg orally daily, for a 5-day course, is appropriate for most patients, and a dose taper is unnecessary (see Table 3 in the original guideline document for COPD treatment modalities) <em>[I, A]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Antibiotics
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Most patients who are hospitalized with AECOPD should be treated with antibiotics (see Tables 3 and 4 and Figure 2 in the original guideline document)<em> [II, A]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A 5-day duration of antibiotics is likely adequate for inpatients that demonstrate rapid improvement <em>[II, D]</em>. Longer courses (7-10 days) may be considered for patients with severe illness or those who are slow to respond to treatment. </li>
    <li>Supportive care
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Acute oxygen therapy. Oxygen should be provided to treat hypoxemia to a pulse-ox target of 88% to 92% <em>[II, D]</em>. </li>
        <li>Non-invasive positive pressure ventilatory support (NIPPV).
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>NIPPV in the form of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) (or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) should be initiated in patients with AECOPD who have persistent or worsening respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or respiratory acidosis despite medical therapy (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document) <em>[I, A]</em>. </li>
            <li>NIPPV should be initiated early in AECOPD <em>[I, A]</em>. </li>
            <li>Predictors for success and contraindications should be highlighted when considering the use of NIPPV (see Table 5 in the original guideline document) <em>[I, D]</em>. </li>
            <li>Patients who are started on NIPPV should be monitored closely, and the decision whether or not to intubate should be made within 2 hours of starting NIPPV <em>[I, D]</em>. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Preventative care in the hospital should include smoking cessation interventions <em>[I, A]</em>, appropriate vaccinations <em>[II, A]</em>, and venous thromboembolism prevention <em>[I, A]</em>. </li>
        <li>A comprehensive approach to discharge is recommended <em>[I, D]</em>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Key elements of the hospital discharge are summarized in Table 6 of the original guideline document. </li>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A Cochrane meta-analysis demonstrated that there are several benefits to the use of corticosteroids in the acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) population. Corticosteroid use typically results in a reduction of symptoms and improvement in spirometric measurements when given for AECOPD. In addition, the risk of treatment failure is reduced (number needed to treat [NNT] = 9 patients treated with corticosteroids to prevent 1 treatment failure). In non-intensive care unit (ICU) inpatients, the length-of-stay was decreased by an average of 1.2 days in patients treated with systemic corticosteroids. </li>
    <li>Studies suggest that antibiotics do improve outcomes in AECOPD patients, even though the majority of the underlying infections are probably viral in nature. It is likely that antibiotics are only of benefit in a subset of patients with a bacterial infection of the airways. Patients with more severe illness (including inpatients) may be more likely to benefit from the use of antibiotics. </li>
    <li>The benefits of using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in AECOPD are well established. A recent Cochrane review evaluated 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NIPPV plus usual care vs. usual care alone. The relative risk of intubation when using NIPPV was 0.41 with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4. The relative risk of mortality was 0.52 with a NNT of 10. </li>
    <li>The influenza vaccine has been shown to decrease AECOPD in patients with COPD. Although the pneumococcal vaccine has not been shown to reduce AECOPD, it does appear to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in a general population. </li>
    <li>Patient education can improve adherence and technique, and decrease hospitalizations for AECOPD. </li>
    <li>Studies in the 1980s demonstrated a survival benefit for patients with resting hypoxemia when they were treated with continuous home oxygen therapy. </li>
    <li>Long-term use of oxygen may have a reparative effect, and lead to improvements in oxygenation over time, and these may reverse if the oxygen therapy is removed. </li>
    <li>Enrollment in pulmonary rehabilitation after AECOPD has been linked to decreased mortality and hospitalization rates, and improvements in quality-of-life. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although most hospitalized patients will benefit from corticosteroid treatment for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), it should be noted that some patients will suffer side-effects from these agents, and may not tolerate them. The adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids include hyperglycemia, insomnia, psychiatric disturbances (including psychosis), muscle wasting, osteoporosis, and increased appetite/weight gain. Of these, hyperglycemia is the most common. Hyperglycemia can usually, but not always, be actively managed to allow the continued use of the corticosteroids. Insulin may be required to control blood glucose levels when using corticosteroids in the hospital setting. Problems such as severe hyperglycemia, severe insomnia, or psychiatric disturbances may require discontinuation of the corticosteroids. </li>
    <li>Since most of the adverse effects of corticosteroids are directly related to the extent of exposure to the medication, there is good reason to use the lowest dose and shortest duration that is effective. </li>
    <li>Potential adverse events associated with azithromycin therapy include QT prolongation and hearing loss. </li>
    <li>Although there is some evidence that levalbuterol may provide bronchodilation with less beta-adrenergic side effects than albuterol, there is only limited clinical data supporting its use, and no data directly supporting its use in AECOPD. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to Tables 3A, 3B, and 4 for additional side effects of specific treatments.</p>
