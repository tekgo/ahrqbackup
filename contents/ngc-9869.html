Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the levels of evidence (<strong>I&ndash;V</strong>) and the grades of the recommendations (<strong>A&ndash;D</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considerations for Surgical Planning</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Patients undergoing mastectomy should be offered a pre-operative referral to a plastic surgeon. The adoption of this approach by practicing surgeons would benefit breast cancer patients nationwide and would result in enhanced patient education of reconstructive options. <strong><em>Grade: D</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Immediate Versus Delayed Reconstruction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Evidence is varied and conflicting on the association between post-operative complications and the timing of post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction and is often confounded by the use of radiation. The inconsistent research findings and a lack of definitive evidence should alert physicians to evaluate each case individually. <strong><em>Level II, III, IV Evidence; Grade: C</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Risk Factors for Post-operative Complications with Expander/Implants</strong></p>
<p><em>Smoking</em></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Smoking is associated with an increased risk of complications and an increased risk of reconstructive failure in patients undergoing post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction. Patients should be informed of the increased risks and advised on smoking cessation as means to decrease surgical complications. Additionally, it should be recognized that the decision to proceed with surgery may preclude timely smoking cessation. <strong><em>Level II, III, IV Evidence; Grade: A</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Obesity</em></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater is associated with an increased risk of post-operative complications and reconstructive failure among patients undergoing post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction. These risks are even higher among patients with a BMI greater than 30. Obese patients should be informed of their increased surgical risks with expander/implant reconstructions and advised on practical weight loss solutions. Additionally, it should be recognized that the decision to proceed with surgery may preclude timely weight management. <strong><em>Level III, IV Evidence; Grade: A</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Breast Size</em></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Pre-operative breast size, specifically C or larger, may be associated with an increased risk of complication and an increased risk of reconstructive failure in patients undergoing post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction. However, much of the currently available evidence does not control for BMI, which is associated with both pre-operative breast size and complication rates. Given the limited evidence and contradictory literature, physicians should be aware of this potential complicating factor. <strong><em>Level III, IV Evidence; Grade: D</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Diabetes</em></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: There is no evidence to indicate that diabetes is a significant independent risk factor for the development of either post-operative complications or reconstructive failure in patients undergoing post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction. However, this information should not deter surgeons from continuing to practice glycemic control in the peri-operative period for breast cancer patients. <strong><em>Level II, III, IV Evidence; Grade: B </em></strong></p>
<p><em>Radiation Therapy</em></p>
<p><strong>Overall Recommendation</strong>: The optimal timing of radiation is within eight weeks of the mastectomy. Radiation is associated with an increased risk of complications and reconstructive failure among patients undergoing post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction. Patients should be counseled in regards to these increased risks. <strong><em>Level II, III, IV Evidence; Grade: B</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Chemotherapy</em></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Pre-operative chemotherapy does not appear to be a significant risk factor for either post-operative complications or implant failure in patients undergoing post-mastectomy expander/implants breast reconstruction. <strong><em>Level II, III, IV Evidence; Grade: C</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Hormonal Therapy</em></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Hormonal therapy may increase the risk of post-operative complications and reconstruction failure in patients undergoing post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction. However, inconsistent research findings and a lack of definitive evidence should alert physicians to evaluate each case individually. <strong><em>Level II, IV Evidence; Grade: D</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Treatment</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Antibiotic Prophylaxis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Patients undergoing post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction should receive a pre-operative dose of an appropriate intravenous (IV) antibiotic initiated 60 minutes or less from the time of incision (within two hours for antibiotics with longer infusion times). Unless a drain is present, antibiotics should be discontinued within 24-hours of the completion of the procedure. If a drain is present, the role of antibiotics is less clear and should be left to physician preference. Of note, documenting a drain in proximity to the implant as a reason for continuation of IV antibiotics beyond the 24-hour post-operative period or switching to post-operative antibiotics within 24-hours of procedure completion is compliant with current Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) guidelines. Presently, there is limited evidence on post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. Overall, surgeons should adhere to their specific state and hospital guidelines on antibiotic administration. <strong><em>Grade: D</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Evidence on ADM in post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction is varied and conflicting. Surgeons should evaluate each clinical case individually and objectively determine the use of ADM. <strong><em>Level III Evidence; Grade: C</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Monitoring for Cancer Recurrence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Clinical examination is sufficient to detect local cancer recurrence in patients undergoing post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction. Imaging studies are not required as part of routine surveillance. On the basis of clinical suspicion, imaging studies can be used for clinical indications on a case-by-case basis. Diagnostic imaging is indicated if there is any clinical concern for recurrence. <strong><em>Grade: D</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Effect of Implant-based Reconstruction on Oncologic Outcomes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Post-mastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction does not adversely affect oncologic outcomes. The need for post-mastectomy radiation therapy is often, but not always, apparent prior to surgery; accordingly, decisions regarding the sequencing of post-mastectomy breast reconstruction and radiation therapy are best made by a multidisciplinary team including the oncologic surgeon, plastic surgeon, medical oncologist and radiation oncologist. <strong><em>Level: III Evidence; Grade: B</em></strong></p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Search and Admission of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Published studies were sought by using electronic and manual search strategies. The primary search, executed from December 2011 to February 2012, was conducted in PubMed with the following keywords, MEDLINE Medical Subject Headings (indicated as [MeSH]), publication types (indicated as [ptyp]), Boolean operators, and limits:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>(Mammaplasty[MeSH] AND reconstruction) OR "breast reconstruction" </li>
    <li>Case reports[ptyp] OR Editorial[ptyp] OR Comment[ptyp] OR Letter[ptyp] OR News[ptyp] OR Newspaper article[ptyp] OR In Vitro[ptyp] OR Legal Cases[ptyp] OR Legislation[ptyp] </li>
    <li>#1 NOT #2; Limits: English, Humans </li>
</ol>
<p>Recent studies that may not have been indexed (e.g., publisher-supplied and pre-MEDLINE citations) were sought using a keyword search strategy similar to item 1 above, without MeSH terms or limits on publication type, up through the search cut-off date of December 31, 2011. Supplemental electronic searches were performed in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Cochrane Library. In addition, a manual review of reference lists from the previous two years and studies accepted per the conditions designated for the literature search, supplemented the electronic searches.</p>
<p>Study selection for each clinical question was accomplished through two levels of study screening. Level I screening was performed by a single reviewer and involved a review of the titles and abstracts downloaded from the literature search noted above. At Level II screening, the full article was obtained, and the study was reviewed for fit with inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined in Appendix B in the original guideline document. The reason for exclusion (e.g., no outcomes of interest) was noted for all articles reviewed at Level II that were ultimately found ineligible for inclusion in the guideline. Work Group Members reviewed the list of excluded articles and the reasons for exclusion to determine whether articles should be excluded or reconsidered for inclusion.</p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion if they were relevant to clinical questions about risk factors, treatment options, and post-operative complications and if they were deemed high or moderate quality per the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) critical appraisal process. Additional references were included if considered necessary for discussion; however, these references were not critically appraised and are clearly documented in the guideline text. Details of literature search terms and search results are provided in Appendix B in the original guideline document.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The literature search identified a total of 2,749 articles that were subject to Level I screening, for a total of 295 remaining articles. After Level II screening and critical appraisal, the results were narrowed to 178 articles, of which ultimately 62 studies were deemed relevant and of high to moderate quality. These studies were used to develop practice recommendations.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Critical Appraisal of the Literature</strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) evidence-based process includes a rigorous critical appraisal process. Each study is appraised by at least two reviewers. If a discrepancy exists between the reviewers, the literature is appraised by a third reviewer, and the level of evidence is determined by consensus. Studies are appraised and assigned levels of evidence according to the ASPS Evidence Rating Scales for therapy, risk, and diagnosis (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Checklists appropriate for the clinical question (therapy, prognosis/risk, or diagnosis) and study design (randomized controlled trial, cohort/comparative, case control, etc.) are employed. The checklists used by ASPS are similar to commonly used appraisal tools (e.g., checklists developed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme [CASP] and the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine [CEBM]). Evidence ratings are not assigned to studies with inadequately described methods and/or worrisome biases.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Clinical Question Development</strong></p>
<p>Work Group Members utilized the Nominal Group Technique to reach consensus on the clinical questions to be addressed in the evidence-based guideline. The Nominal Group Technique is ideal for face-to-face meetings and is designed to encourage equal participation in Work Group discussions and project contributions. The Work Group completed five rounds of the consensus process. Before the Introductory Meeting, all Work Group Members submitted 97 potential clinical questions, which were compiled and dispersed at the Introductory Meeting for consideration and discussion. The clinical questions were ranked according to the following criteria to assess for potential impact:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Relevance to guideline scope </li>
    <li>Addresses a gap in care </li>
    <li>Can be developed into an actionable recommendation </li>
    <li>Can be developed into an implementable recommendation </li>
    <li>Is controversial or of significant interest </li>
    <li>Is important to public health </li>
</ol>
<p>The Work Group agreed on the following clinical questions to address in this evidence-based guideline, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In patients undergoing surgical treatment for breast cancer, what is the optimal time to discuss breast reconstruction options? </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer, what is the optimal time for implant-based reconstruction (i.e., immediate versus delayed) when radiation treatment is not required? </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer, what is the optimal time for implant-based reconstruction (i.e., immediate versus delayed) when radiation treatment is required? </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing breast reconstruction following mastectomy, what are the risk factors when undergoing immediate implant-based reconstruction? </li>
    <li>In patients requiring radiation therapy and undergoing immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy, when is the optimal time for radiation therapy? </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing implant-based reconstruction after mastectomy, what is the optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of postoperative infections? </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing mastectomy and implant-based breast reconstruction, what are the outcomes associated with utilizing acellular dermal matrix during reconstruction? </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing mastectomy and implant-based breast reconstruction, what are the screening recommendations to monitor for cancer recurrence? </li>
    <li>In patients undergoing breast reconstruction following mastectomy, what are the oncologic outcomes associated with undergoing immediate implant-based reconstruction? </li>
</ol>
<p>The systematic review process yielded relevant evidence for six questions. The questions on radiation therapy were combined based on available evidence. Additionally, three clinical questions were addressed through supplemental research and cumulative work group clinical expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Development of Clinical Practice Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations were developed through a consensus process. After a thorough review of the evidence, Guideline Work Group Members jointly drafted statements for each recommendation during conference call meetings and online discussions. After each meeting, members had an opportunity to individually comment and revise the draft recommendations via an email discussion. Guideline Work Group Members participated in several rounds of revisions until unanimous consensus was achieved on each recommendation statement. Each recommendation in this guideline is accompanied by a grade indicating the strength of supporting evidence, taking into account the overall level of evidence and the judgment of the guideline developers.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evidence-based guidelines are strategies for patient management, developed to assist physicians in clinical decision making. This guideline was developed through a comprehensive review of the scientific literature and consideration of relevant clinical experience, and describes a range of generally acceptable approaches to diagnosis, management, or prevention of specific diseases or conditions. This guideline attempts to define principles of practice that should generally meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. </li>
    <li>This guideline should not be construed as a rule, nor should it be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the appropriate results. It is anticipated that it will be necessary to approach some patients' needs in different ways. The ultimate judgment regarding the care of a particular patient must be made by the physician in light of all the circumstances presented by the patient, the available diagnostic and treatment options, and available resources. </li>
    <li>This guideline is not intended to define or serve as the standard of medical care. Standards of medical care are determined on the basis of all the facts or circumstances involved in an individual case and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and as practice patterns evolve. This guideline reflects the state of current knowledge at the time of publication. Given the inevitable changes in the state of scientific information and technology, this guideline will be reviewed, updated and revised periodically. </li>
