Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The classes of evidence (I-III) and levels of recommendation (1-3) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1 Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>All recreational skiers and snowboarders should wear safety helmets to reduce the incidence and severity of head injury during these sports. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As with evidence regarding helmet efficacy in the reduction of head injury and mortality in motorcycle crashes, Class I evidence on helmet efficacy in recreational skiing and snowboarding is lacking. However, the above statement has been designated as a Level I recommendation because in the review of evidence, a preponderance of Class II data regarding helmet efficacy in head injuries in skiers and snowboarders with significant construct validity was observed. This was further coupled with the acknowledgement of the inability to ethically perform a randomized controlled trial in this arena.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2 Recommendations/Observations</strong></p>
<p>The following observations were also made during the review of literature on the subject:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Helmets do not appear to increase the risk compensation behavior among skiers and snowboarders. </li>
    <li>Helmets do not appear to increase the risk of neck and cervical spine injuries among skiers and snowboarders. </li>
    <li>Policies and interventions directed towards increasing and promoting helmet use should be promoted to reduce mortality and head injury in recreational skiers and snowboarders. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classes of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Prospective clinical trial or retrospective analysis based on reliable data.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Retrospective case series or database review.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong>: The recommendation is convincingly justifiable based on the available scientific information alone. This recommendation is usually based on Class I data; however, strong Class II evidence may form the basis for a Level 1 recommendation, especially if the issue does not lend itself to testing in a randomized format.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong>: The recommendation is reasonably justifiable by available scientific evidence and strongly supported by expert opinion. This recommendation is usually supported by Class II data or a preponderance of Class III evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong>: The recommendation is supported by available data but adequate scientific evidence is lacking. This recommendation is generally supported by Class III data. This type of recommendation is useful for educational purposes and in guiding future clinical research.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Original Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search of published medical literature was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE databases using the following key words in different combinations with Boolean operators: "equipment", "helmet", "helmet use", "head protective devices", "skiing", "skiers", "snowboarders", "snowboarding", "snow sports", "injury", "head injury", "head trauma", "traumatic brain injury", "craniocerebral trauma", "neck injury", "cervical spine injury", "winter sports" and "risk compensation behavior". Only published citations involving human participants (all ages, both genders) between January, 1980 and April, 2011 were selected for initial review. As no study analyzed the impact of any legislation for safety helmets, reports from other countries were also included. The keyword combination "helmet OR head protective devices OR equipment AND (skiing OR snowboarding OR skier OR snowboarder)" yielded 554, zero and 2,646 articles in PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE respectively. The search was considerably coned down by eliminating the word "equipment" from the keyword phrase as it was felt to have very broad connotations and the search yield using it included a large proportion of articles evaluating other protective gear such as wrist-guards, mouth-guards, spine-boards, ski-boots, etc. The alternative approach resulted in 83, zero and 96 hits in PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE respectively. Only one article in Cochrane Library was retrieved when the specific keyword combination "skiing OR snowboarding" was used. After the exclusion of duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 91 articles were examined to exclude reports in a language other than English, reports which were not available for review in their entirety, review articles, commentaries, letters to the editor, technical or engineering or biomechanical reports, retrospective studies of poor quality and single case reports. Studies describing analysis of original data on helmet usage in relation to death, head, neck or cervical spine injury and risk compensation behavior were selected.</p>
<p>A total of 16 published studies eventually met inclusion criteria for this evidence based review and careful consideration was given to the methodology section of each paper to ensure that it strictly fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. These selected manuscripts were then reviewed in detail by the authors.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search of published medical literature was conducted from 2011-2016 using PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE databases using the following key words: "helmet", "head protective devices", "equipment", "skiing", "snowboarding", "skier", "snowboarder".</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Inclusion criteria: Articles comparing helmet and non-helmet wearers with head injuries and/or spinal injuries; all articles with risk compensation behavior as an outcome. </li>
    <li>Exclusion criteria: Non-English language articles were excluded. Articles were first screened by title, with all titles that were specifically about non-head and non-spinal injuries eliminated. The remaining articles were then screened by abstract. Abstracts with conclusions that did not discuss helmet usage were eliminated. </li>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A total of 16 published studies eventually met inclusion criteria for this evidence based review and careful consideration was given to the methodology section of each paper to ensure that it strictly fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. These selected manuscripts were then reviewed in detail by the authors. As is the case with motorcycle or bicycle helmets, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be conducted on helmet usage in recreational skiers and snowboarders due to the ethical concerns involved. Earlier descriptive studies have shown that the most of the fatal injuries in skiers and snowboarders were seen in individuals without helmets. In the absence of Class I studies on helmet usage in these sports, the authors have to completely rely on retrospective cohort, cross-sectional, case-control/case-cross over and case-control studies for evidence of helmet efficacy in recreational skiing and snowboarding. It is also interesting to note that most of the better designed and more robustly analyzed studies on the subject in literature have been conducted only in the past decade.</p>
<p>An evidentiary table (see Table 1 in the original guideline document) was constructed using the 16 references that were identified.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Original Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The following questions regarding the efficacy of safety helmets in reduction of injuries in recreational skiers and snowboarders were considered:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Does helmet use increase or decrease the rate of fatal and non-fatal head injury among skiers and snowboarders? </li>
    <li>Does helmet use increase or decrease the rates of neck or cervical spine injury in skiers and snowboarders? </li>
    <li>Is helmet use associated with higher or lower risk compensation behavior among skiers and snowboarders? </li>
</ol>
<p>Recommendations were made on the basis of the studies included in the evidentiary table (see the appendix of the original guideline document). Recommendations were classified as level 1, 2, or 3 according to the definitions listed in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A total of 42 full articles were reviewed by a single reviewer. No articles were found to have statistically significant findings that contradict the recommendations.</p></div>
