Description

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of heart failure patients age 18 years and older who have comprehensive patient education and follow-up care.</p>
<p>Heart failure is a major health problem in the United States (U.S.), and the incidence of the disease is increasing. The overall estimated 2004 prevalence of heart failure in adults age 20 and older in the U.S. was 5.2 million, with it being equally distributed among men and women.</p>
<p>Comprehensive discharge planning with detailed written instructions for the patient and caregivers should be implemented to promote compliance and understanding of treatment and educational goals. A discharge follow-up appointment should be scheduled within 7 to 10 days to assess the patient's status, titrate medications toward recommended target doses, and to reinforce and supplement education initiated in the hospital. Communication with the next care clinician needs to be completed in a timely manner so all care team members in all settings have the information necessary to care for the patient. Accountability needs to be assigned for care so the patient doesn't "fall between the cracks" of hospital, primary and specialty care.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In age 20 to 39, the incidence of heart failure is 0.3% of the population in men and 0.2% of the population in women. In the ages 40s and 50s, the incidence is 2% in men and 1.5% in women. In the 60 to 79 age group, the incidence is 7.2% in men and 5.2% in women. However, once reaching age 80, the incidence of heart failure is higher in women, with 11.6% of men and 12.4% of women. </li>
    <li>Seventy-five percent of heart failure cases have antecedent hypertension in that the lifetime risk for heart failure doubles for people with blood pressure greater than 160/90 versus those with blood pressure less than 140/90. A community-based cohort study conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota, showed that the incidence of heart failure (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD9]-428) has not declined during the past two decades, but survival after onset has increased overall, with less improvement among women and elderly persons. </li>
