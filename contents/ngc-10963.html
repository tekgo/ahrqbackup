<h2>Recommendations

<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blepharospasm</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>OnabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNT-A) and incobotulinumtoxinA (incoBoNT-A) injections should be considered (<strong>Level B</strong>), and aboBoNT-A may be considered (<strong>Level C</strong>), as treatment options for blepharospasm.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is considered the first-line treatment of blepharospasm by most movement disorder specialists. All 3 type A toxins appear to have similar efficacy and can continue to be efficacious over long periods.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cervical Dystonia (CD)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>AbobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) and rimabotulinumtoxinB (rimaBoNT-B) should be offered (<strong>Level A</strong>), and onaBoNT-A and incoBoNT-A should be considered (<strong>Level B</strong>), as options for the treatment of CD.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>BoNT is accepted as first-line treatment for CD. Although the evidence levels may differ across BoNT serotypes and brands, all formulations have regulatory approval and are commonly used. There is an extensive clinical history of onaBoNT-A and incoBoNT-A use, but the lack of additional Class I studies led to only a Level B recommendation. Comparative trials indicate similar efficacy for rimaBoNT-B and onaBoNT-A, and for aboBoNT-A and onaBoNT-A, in the treatment of CD.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spasticity in Adults</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Upper Extremity Spasticity</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For focal manifestations of adult spasticity involving the upper limb, aboBoNT-A, incoBoNT-A, and onaBoNT-A should be offered (<strong>Level A</strong>), and rimaBoNT-B should be considered (<strong>Level B</strong>), as treatment options. </li>
    <li>OnaBoNT-A should be considered as a treatment option before tizanidine (TZD) for treating adult upper extremity spasticity (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Both high-volume, low-potency injections of onaBoNT-A and endplate targeting of onaBoNT-A into proximal upper extremity muscles should be considered to enhance tone reduction in spasticity (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lower Extremity Spasticity</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>For focal manifestations of adult spasticity involving the lower limb that warrant treatment, onaBoNT-A and aboBoNT-A should be offered (<strong>Level A</strong>) as treatment options.</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of incoBoNT-A or rimaBoNT-B for treatment of adult lower limb spasticity.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Although BoNT can reduce increased tone in spasticity, the impact of BoNT injections on functional outcomes is mixed, suggesting that potential functional gains are highly patient-specific. Because of the lack of comparative trials, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that any one of the BoNT formulations is superior to the others.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Headache</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Chronic Migraine (CM)</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>OnaBoNT-A should be offered as a treatment option to patients with CM to increase the number of headache-free days (<strong>Level A</strong>) and should be considered to reduce headache impact on health-related quality of life (QOL) (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>Although the reduction of headache days with onaBoNT-A was statistically superior to placebo in 2 Class I studies, the magnitude of the difference is small (1.7 and 2.3).</p>
<p><strong>Episodic Migraine (EM)</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>OnaBoNT-A should not be offered as a treatment for EM (<strong>Level A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Classification of Evidence Scheme</strong></p>
<p><em>Class I</em></p>
<p>A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p>The following are also required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for dropouts (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and crossovers with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias </li>
    <li>For noninferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or noninferiority </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose, and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective) </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the study results is based on a per-protocol analysis that accounts for dropouts or crossovers </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Class II</em></p>
<p>A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a&ndash;e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b-e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><em>Class III</em></p>
<p>All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.**</p>
<p><em>Class IV</em></p>
<p>Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus or expert opinion. </p>
<p class="Note">*Numbers 1&ndash;3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class="Note">**Objective outcome measurement: An outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The committee searched the EMBASE, Medline, and Science Citation Index databases to find relevant studies published from April 2007 (endpoint of the search performed for the prior guidelines) to August 2011. They updated the search in December 2014 and again in October 2015. The bibliographies of review articles also were searched to identify articles missed by the initial search strategy (see Appendix e-3 for complete search strategy). Additionally, because studies comparing different botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) formulations in the treatment of cervical dystonia (CD) were not included in the 2008 guideline, they repeated the pre-2008 search to identify comparative trials.</p>
<p>To be eligible for inclusion, English-language articles had to compare outcomes between patients with blepharospasm, CD, adult spasticity, or headache receiving a preparation of BoNT that is commercially available in the United States with outcomes of a group of patients receiving an alternative therapy. Acceptable alternative therapies included placebo or another treatment&mdash;including a different form of BoNT or a different technique for administering BoNT. At least 20 patients must have been enrolled in each study. In general, only randomized, masked trials (RMTs) were considered. When RMTs were not available to assess long-term outcomes or safety concerns, evidence from nonrandomized trials was used.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix e-3 in the supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for search terms.</p>
<p>The search identified 3,371 citations. A review of titles and abstracts identified 55 potentially relevant articles for blepharospasm, 100 for CD, 279 for spasticity, and 144 for headache. The committee reviewed the full text of these articles for meeting inclusion criteria.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The panel formulated recommendations on the basis of the conclusions; recommendations are tied directly to the evidence (see Appendix e-5 in the Data Supplement [see "Availability of Companion Documents"]). Table e-1 (see Data Supplement in the "Availability of Companion Documents") presents the conclusions and recommendations for efficacy of various botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) formulations.</p>
<p>Unlike the approach taken in previous American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines, where BoNT was evaluated for safety and efficacy as a single class, in this update the panel assessed each formulation separately for each indication. As a result, the level of support for efficacy in the conclusions and recommendations may be lower for the individual BoNT formulations than it would be had BoNT been considered as a class. The recommendations reflect the confidence in the level of evidence, but because studies of comparative efficacy are few, the recommendations should not be construed to indicate that one drug is superior to another. </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines. Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this clinical practice guideline. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects.
