<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients undergoing a total knee replacement with documented shared decision-making including discussion of conservative (non-surgical) therapy (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], analgesics, weight loss, exercise, injections) prior to the procedure.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A trial of non-surgical therapy should be used prior to surgery, when possible. Non-surgical therapy may include the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], other analgesics, exercise, or injections. For patients with severe disability, the patient and surgeon may decide after a thorough review of conservative options that the optimal treatment is to proceed with the operative intervention.</p>
<p>In a study conducted by SooHoo and colleagues at 3 hospitals, 54 percent of the patients had documentation of the history of the present illness which included the evaluation of the prior treatments and medications. Variation between the 3 hospitals ranged from 27 percent to 75 percent (SooHoo et al., 2011).</p>
<p class="Note">The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines:</p>
<p class="Note">The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) suggests that patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee be encouraged to participate in self-management educational programs (AAOS, 2008).</p>
<p class="Note">AAOS recommends that patients with symptomatic OA of the knee who are overweight (body mass index [BMI] greater than 25) should be encouraged to lose weight (a minimum of 5% of body weight) and maintain their weight at a lower level with an appropriate program for dietary modification and exercise (AAOS, 2008).</p>
<p class="Note">AAOS recommends that patients with symptomatic OA of the knee be encouraged to participate in low-impact aerobic fitness exercises (AAOS, 2008).</p>
<p class="Note">AAOS suggests that patients with symptomatic OA of the knee use patellar taping for short-term relief of pain and improvement in function (AAOS, 2008).</p>
<p class="Note">AAOS suggests that patients with symptomatic OA of the knee receive one of the following analgesics for pain unless there are contradictions to this treatment: acetaminophen (less than 4g/day) or NSAIDs (AAOS, 2008).</p>
<p class="Note">AAOS suggests that intra-articular corticosteroids be used for short-term pain relief for patients with symptomatic OA of the knee (AAOS, 2008).</p>
<p class="Note">Patients with knee OA who are not obtaining adequate pain relief and functional improvement from a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment should be considered for joint replacement therapy (Zhang et al., 2008).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>High Impact Topic Area</em><br />
During 1991 to 2010, the rate of primary total knee replacement procedures among the Medicare population increased over 161 percent from 93,230 procedures in 1991 to 243,802 procedures in 2010. The rate of revision procedures increased over 105 percent from 9,650 to 19,871 procedures. The majority of the primary total knee replacements were performed on women (approximately 65 percent) (Cram et al., 2012).</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the overall total knee replacement rate increased 58% (from 5.5 to 8.7 per 1,000 population) between 2000 and 2006. Similar increases were observed by sex, age group, and black or white race. Total knee replacement rates were 37 percent lower among blacks than whites (3.6 versus 5.7 per 1,000 population) in 2000, and 39% lower in 2006 (5.6 versus 9.2). In both years, the black/white disparity was lower among women (23% and 28%) than among men (63% and 60%). In 2006, blacks had a lower total knee replacement rate than whites in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (CDC, 2009).</p>
<p>In 2004 there were over 450,000 total knee replacements performed in the United States (American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons [AAOS], 2008).</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2009, over 22 percent of adults reported they had been diagnosed with arthritis (CDC, 2010). As the population ages, there will be an increased growth in the number of procedures. It is estimated that the number of total knee replacements performed per year could be over 3 million by the year 2030 (Kurtz et al., 2007).</p>
<p><em>Costs</em><br />
Medicare paid approximately $3.2 billion in 2000 for hip and knee joint replacements (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2003).</p>
<p>The overall inpatient costs for replacement of the knee during 2007 was over $9.2 billion with hospital stays of more than 605,000 (Stranges, Russo, &amp; Friedman, 2009).</p></div>
