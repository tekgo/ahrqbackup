<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Dementia is often characterized by the gradual onset and continuing cognitive decline in one or more domains including memory, executive function, language, judgment, and spatial abilities (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2007). Cognitive deterioration represents a major source of morbidity and mortality and poses a significant burden on affected individuals and their caregivers (Daviglus et al., 2010). Although cognitive deterioration follows a different course depending on the type of dementia, significant rates of decline have been reported. For example, one study found that the annual rate of decline for Alzheimer's disease patients was more than four times that of older adults with no cognitive impairment (Wilson et al., 2010). Nevertheless, measurable cognitive abilities remain throughout the course of dementia (APA, 2007). Initial and ongoing assessments of cognition are fundamental to the proper management of patients with dementia. These assessments serve as the basis for identifying treatment goals, developing a treatment plan, monitoring the effects of treatment, and modifying treatment as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Ongoing assessment includes periodic monitoring of the development and evolution of cognitive and noncognitive psychiatric symptoms and their response to intervention. Both cognitive and noncognitive neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms of dementia tend to evolve over time, so regular monitoring allows detection of new symptoms and adaptation of treatment strategies to current needs... Cognitive symptoms that almost always require assessment include impairments in memory, executive function, language, judgment, and spatial abilities. It is often helpful to track cognitive status with a structured simple examination (APA, 2007).</p>
<p>Conduct and document an assessment and monitor changes in cognitive status using a reliable and valid instrument. Cognitive status should be reassessed periodically to identify sudden changes, as well as to monitor the potential beneficial or harmful effects of environmental changes, specific medications, or other interventions. Proper assessment requires the use of a standardized, objective instrument that is relatively easy to use, reliable (with less variability between different assessors), and valid (results that would be similar to gold standard evaluations) (California Workgroup on Guidelines for Alzheimer's Disease Management, 2008). </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reasons for Prioritizing Improvement in Dementia</strong></p>
<p><em>High Impact Topic Area</em></p>
<p>Dementia is a chronic condition that poses a major and growing threat to the public's health. Improving the effectiveness of care and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Dementia affects approximately 5% to 8% of individuals over age 65 years, 15% to 20% of individuals over age 75 years, and 25% to 50% of individuals over age 85 years (Alzheimer's Association, 2009). </li>
    <li>Currently, an estimated 5.3 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's disease &ndash; the most common form of dementia (Alzheimer's Association, 2010). </li>
    <li>More than 20 percent of women and approximately 17 percent of men reaching the age of 65 would ultimately develop dementia (estimated lifetime risk) (Alzheimer's Association, 2010). </li>
    <li>Alzheimer's disease was the sixth-leading cause of death across all ages in the United States in 2007 (Xu et al., 2007). It was the fifth-leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older in 2006 (Alzheimer's Association, 2010). </li>
    <li>People with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias have more than three times as many hospital stays as other older people (Alzheimer's Association, 2010). </li>
    <li>At any one time, about one-quarter of all hospital patients aged 65 and older are people with Alzheimer's and other dementias (Alzheimer's Association, 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2009, almost 11 million family members, friends and neighbors provided 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. This number represents an average of 21.9 hours of care per caregiver per week, or 1,139 hours of care per caregiver per year (Alzheimer's Association, 2010). </li>
    <li>The total estimated worldwide costs of dementia are $604 billion in 2010, accounting for around 1% of the world's gross domestic product (Alzheimer's Disease International, 2010). </li>
    <li>In 2005, the direct costs to Medicare and Medicaid for care for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and the estimated indirect costs to businesses for employees who were caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias amounted to more than $148 billion (Alzheimer's Association, 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Demonstrated Opportunity for Improvement</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>According to a study analyzing the quality of medical care provided to vulnerable community-dwelling older patients, quality of care for geriatric conditions (e.g., dementia, urinary incontinence) was found to be poorer than care for general medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart failure). On average, patients with dementia received the recommended quality of care only about 35 percent of the time (Wenger et al., 2003). </li>
    <li>Chodosh and colleagues found that current practice patterns indicate a significant opportunity for improvement in the quality of dementia care with a majority (11 of 18) of guideline-recommended dementia care processes having less than 40% adherence (Chodosh, Mittman, &amp; Connor, 2007). </li>
    <li>Another study identified considerable variability across sites in the routine implementation of recommended practices for the assessment, management and treatment of patients with dementia (Rosen et al., 2002). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disparities</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of dementia treatment, care, and research identified significant racial and ethnic disparities in western countries, particularly the United States. Overall, the authors found "consistent evidence, mostly from the United States, that [minority ethnic] people accessed diagnostic services later in their illness, and once they received a diagnosis, were less likely to access antidementia medication, research trials, and 24-hour care" (Cooper et al., 2010). </li>
