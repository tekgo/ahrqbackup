<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The removal of any pressure to not perform a cesarean birth has led to a skyrocketing of hospital, state and national cesarean birth (CB) rates. Some hospitals now have CB rates over 50%. Hospitals with CB rates at 15% to 20% have infant outcomes that are just as good and better maternal outcomes (Gould et al., 2004). There are no data that higher rates improve any outcomes, yet the CB rates continue to rise. This measure seeks to focus attention on the most variable portion of the CB epidemic, the term labor CB in nulliparous women. This population segment accounts for the large majority of the variable portion of the CB rate and is the area most affected by subjectivity.</p>
<p>As compared to other CB measures, what is different about nulliparous term singleton vertex (NTSV) CB rate (low-risk primary CB in first births) is that there are clear cut quality improvement activities that can be done to address the differences. Main et al. (2006) found that over 60% of the variation among hospitals can be attributed to first birth labor induction rates and first birth early labor admission rates. The results showed if labor was forced when the cervix was not ready the outcomes were poorer. Alfirevic, Edwards, and Platt (2004) also showed that labor and delivery guidelines can make a difference in labor outcomes. Many authors have shown that physician factors, rather than patient characteristics or obstetric diagnoses, are the major driver for the difference in rates within a hospital (Berkowitz et al., 1989; Goyert et al., 1989; Luthy et al., 2003). The dramatic variation in NTSV rates seen in all populations studied is striking according to Menacker (2005). Hospitals within a state (Coonrod et al., 2008; "Utilization rates," 2006) and physicians within a hospital (Main, 1999) have rates with a 3-5 fold variation.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The growing support for the claim that provider-dependent indications are contributing to the overall increase among cesareans can be seen from the results of two recent studies examining the drivers for the increase in cesarean deliveries. Barber et al. (2011) at Yale analyzed primary and repeat cesareans from 2003 to 2009. Among primary cesarean deliveries, more subjective indications (non-reassuring fetal status and arrest of dilation) contributed larger proportions than more objective indications (malpresentation, maternal-fetal, and obstetric conditions). Similarly, Getahun et al. (2009) examined the causes for the rise in cesarean deliveries among different racial and ethnic groups in Kaiser Permanente Southern California over the last 17 years. Their findings were similar to those from Yale. In a retrospective cohort study conducted by Ehrenthal, Jiang, and Strobino (2010), labor induction was associated with a twofold increase in the odds of a cesarean delivery after adjustment for confounders. This was more pronounced among a low-risk group of women without major complications. </li>
    <li>Beyond the medical burden to mothers and babies, the financial burden on payers is large: facility charges for cesarean are nearly twice that for vaginal delivery ($24,700 vs. $14,500). In California alone, the additional heath care costs to the system are conservatively estimated to be over $300 million annually (Main et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>The most frequent causes of severe maternal morbidity are obstetric hemorrhage (bleeding) and uterine infection. These are significantly more common with cesarean surgery and also represent the two leading causes of hospital readmission in the first 30 days post delivery. A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis showed that the rate of severe obstetric hemorrhage has significantly increased (by 50%) over the last 15 years in the U.S. There has also been a 270% increase in blood transfusions, with both hemorrhage and transfusions correlated to the rise in cesarean deliveries. Infection is the most common serious complication of cesarean delivery with typical rates of 3% to 9% (Kuklina et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) report "Evaluation of Cesarean Delivery" (2000) recognizes the importance of the nulliparous, term singleton vertex (NTSV) population as the optimal focus for measurement and quality improvement action. Furthermore, the report identified a target of 15.5% for NTSV births, one recommended by the National Center for Health Statistics. Although the ACOG target rate was directed at the NTSV cesarean delivery rate, the recommendation has been widely misread as recommending a 15.5% total cesarean delivery rate. </li>
    <li>In its 2000 report, ACOG formally recommended that NTSV cesarean delivery rate be used to benchmark all U.S. hospitals and practitioners. This measure and target was then endorsed by the United States Healthy People 2010 objectives: 16-9. This same measure has been reaffirmed in Healthy People 2020 (MICH-7.1) but with a more modest target of a 23.9% NTSV rate. </li>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Twenty-six contracted performance measurement systems (PMS) agreed to support the perinatal care measures. Joint Commission staff defined and developed a database structure for electronic receipt of measure data and a verification process was implemented to assure that measures were embedded into the measurement system's technical infrastructures and into their data collection tools in accord with Joint Commission specifications. Joint Commission staff also verified data collection tools and provided education regarding the performance measure set to PMS vendors, who in turn provided education and ongoing support to their contracted hospitals. </p>
<p>Once sufficient data to support this effort were received by The Joint Commission, a reliability assessment of the measures and individual data elements was conducted from October 2011 through January 2012. A data collection tool was developed to facilitate the reabstraction of selected medical records and assessment of the reliability of the data elements. Reliability test site visits were conducted by Joint Commission staff at a subset of 12 randomly-selected hospitals. Selection of the sites was based on multiple characteristics, including hospital demographics, bed size and type of facility. </p>
<p>In the course of the reliability site visits, electronic and paper medical records were blindly reabstracted by Joint Commission staff. Reabstracted data elements were then compared with the hospital's originally abstracted data on a data element to data element basis. Differences in abstraction were investigated and adjudicated in order to understand the reasons for any disparities. In addition, structured focus group discussions were held at each site to gather additional feedback on the measures. A resource evaluation was also completed by the site visit hospitals to assess the cost and time associated with data collection effort. Feedback from the focus group discussions has been incorporated into the measure summaries. </p></div>
