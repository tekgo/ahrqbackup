<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Excessive use of alcohol and drugs has a substantial harmful impact on health and society in the United States. It is a drain on the economy and a source of enormous personal tragedy (National Quality Forum, 2007). In 1998 the economic costs to society were 185 billion dollars for alcohol misuse and 143 billion dollars was attributable to drug problems (Harwood, 2000). Health care spending was 19 billion dollars for alcohol problems, and 14 billion dollars for drug problems. Nearly a quarter of one trillion dollars in lost productivity is attributable to substance use. More than 537,000 persons died as a consequence of alcohol, drug, and tobacco use, making them the cause of over one out of four deaths in the United States (Mokdad et al., 2004). </p>
<p>An estimated 22.6 million adolescents and adults meet criteria for a substance use disorder, but addiction or dependence is not the most common type of problem. In a multi-state study that screened 459,599 patients in general hospital and medical settings, 23% screened positive. Of these, 16% used alcohol or drugs above safe limits, an additional 3% were very heavy users, but only 4% had an addictive use pattern (Madras et al., 2009). </p>
<p>Clinical trials have demonstrated that brief interventions, especially prior to the onset of addiction, significantly improve health and reduce costs, and that similar benefits occur in those with addictive disorders who are referred to treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2007; National Institutes of Health [NIH] &amp; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA], 2005; Fleming et al., 2002).</p>
<p>Patients with substance-use problems have a greater risk for serious injury and over 50 medical problems including hypertension, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, depression, stroke, dementia, cirrhosis, multiple forms of cancer, dysrhythmias, and infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, endocarditis, and HIV (NIH &amp; NIAAA, 2005). </p>
<p>Hospitalization provides a prime opportunity to address substance use, and for many patients, controlling their other health problems requires addressing their substance use (Fleming et al., 2002). </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure

<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evidence-based screening instruments exist that can detect harmful alcohol and other drug use. Brief interventions that can be delivered during a single primary care office visit have been tested in multiple randomized trials, including a multi-center one in the Medicare eligible age group. They demonstrate that screening and intervention significantly reduce health risks, and generate cost-savings of approximately 4 dollars for every dollar invested in providing them. </li>
    <li>Clinical trials have demonstrated that brief interventions, especially prior to the onset of addiction, significantly improve health and reduce costs, and that similar benefits occur in those with addictive disorders who are referred to treatment. </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Twenty-four hospitals from nineteen states volunteered to participate in a six month pilot test of the draft measures, commencing with discharges beginning March 1, 2010 and concluding on July 31, 2010. There were three tests conducted during the development phase for this measure; public comment, survey of the pilot sites, and a Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) assessment. The purpose was threefold: to gather information regarding face validity, to determine feasibility of data collection, and to gather information about each data element regarding clarity and suggested enhancement that could be made. 2,177 persons responded to the public comment. A total of eleven hospitals and eight TAP members completed the evaluation. </p>
<p>The final phase of testing consisted of site visits to a sample of participating pilot hospitals to assess the reliability of data abstracted and reported by those hospitals. Reliability test site visits were conducted at nine randomly selected pilot hospitals. Selection of the test sites was based on multiple characteristics; including hospital demographics, populations served, bed size and type of facility. </p>
<p>All of the substance use (SUB) measures have undergone a rigorous process of public comment, alpha testing and broad-scale pilot testing and are recognized by the field as important indicators of substance abuse treatment. </p></div>
