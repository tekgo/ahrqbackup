Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the physician-specific risk-standardized rate of procedural complications following the first time implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).</p>
<p>This measure is to be reported a minimum of once per reporting period for patients with a first time implantation of an ICD during the reporting period. This measure may be reported by clinicians who perform the quality actions described in the measure based on the services provided and the measure-specific denominator coding.</p>
<p>There are two reporting criteria for this measure: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with first time implants with one or more complications or mortality within 30 days </li>
    <li>Patients with first time implants with one or more complications within 90 days </li>
</ol></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The proposed measure of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) complications has the potential to significantly improve the quality of care delivered to patients with advanced heart disease. The model used for risk adjustment meets recognized standards for outcomes measurement and was developed with extensive input from stakeholders with a broad range of expertise and perspectives. The study sample is appropriately defined, consisting of an ICD population that has distinct outcomes that will allow for valid comparisons of physician quality. The definition of the complications, the complication-specific period of assessment, and the risk-adjustment variables all have strong face validity, which may facilitate physician acceptance. The developer excluded covariates that it would not want to adjust for in a quality measure.</p>
<p>In summary, the developer presents an ICD complications measure that is suitable for public reporting. The proposed measure capitalizes on the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) ICD Registry data already collected as part of an ongoing collaboration between Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and NCDR. Accordingly, the incremental burden of data collection on physicians would be minimal and the proposed measure could be implemented by using the direct patient identifiers already being collected by CMS.</p>
<p>ICD implantation is an expensive procedure performed on patients with advanced cardiovascular disease and, often, significant comorbidities. Despite improvements in technology and increasing experience with device implantation, the procedure carries a significant risk of complications (Hammill &amp; Curtis, 2008).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Roughly 150,000 ICDs are implanted each year and approximately two thirds of implantations are performed on Medicare patients. </li>
    <li>Direct total medical cost per device (Sanders, Hlatky, &amp; Owens, 2005) is $68,000 to $100,000. The total national costs range from $10 to $15 billion, of which $7 to $10 billion represents fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare. </li>
    <li>Complications are expensive and, in one study (Reynolds et al., 2006), associated with increased length of stay (1 to 10 days) and costs $5,000 to 20,000 (mean $7,251), adding roughly $80 million in Medicare costs. </li>
    <li>Reported complication rates following ICD implantation vary from 4% to 30%, depending largely on how complications are defined and the period of assessment. In the NCDR ICD Registry, the incidence of in-hospital complications is approximately 4%. However, complications such as device infection, malfunction, or cardiac tamponade are not fully captured by the registry since they may only become evident following hospital discharge. </li>
    <li>Al-Khatib et al. (2008) analyzed administrative claims data and found overall rates of complication within 90 days of ICD implantation ranged from 18.8% in 2002 to 14.2% in 2005 (Al-Khatib et al., 2005). </li>
</ul>
<p>The developer analyzed Medicare FFS administrative claims to assess complications rates following ICD implantation. From 2006 through 2009, a total of 105,575 implants performed by 3,488 physicians met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The number of eligible implants increased over time from 22,931 in 2006 to 28,383. The overall complication rate decreased modestly over this time period, from 8.60% to 7.55%. The rate of mechanical complications requiring system revision had the largest decrease over time (0.78%), but similar relative declines were seen across all complications. As expected, the characteristics of patients with and without adverse events differed significantly. Most notably, patients receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-D) device had a significantly higher complication rate than patients receiving a single and dual chamber device (8.09%, 6.30%, and 5.33% respectively). These results demonstrate an opportunity to improve physician-level performance. </p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In March 2010, the Heart Rhythm Society's (HRS) Quality Improvement Subcommittee conducted a strategic planning meeting to identify recommendations on how the Society could best prepare for the increased focus of performance measurement by the United States (U.S.) government and others. The topics discussed included performance measurement in general, as well as public reporting and value-based purchasing, specifically. Through the work of the Measure Development Task Force during Cycle 1 of the initiative, two physician-level measures were fully-specified and tested: <em>HRS-3: Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) Complications Rate</em> and <em>HRS-4: In-Person Evaluation Following Implantation of a Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Device (CIED)</em>. The measures were developed with the intent to submit them to the National Quality Forum (NQF) for endorsement consideration when a relevant call for measures is issued. Pilot testing is a prerequisite for NQF.</p></div>
