            <sup>a</sup>If a reflex test (same specimen/same tissue) ordered after an initial equivocal HER2 test result does not render a positive or negative HER2 test result, the pathologist should review histopathologic features, confer if possible with the oncologist regarding additional HER2 testing, and document it in the pathology report. The pathologist may pursue additional HER2 testing without conferring with the oncologist. This should be accomplished using: (1) the alternative test (IHC and ISH) on the same specimen, (2) either test on another block (same specimen), or (3) either test on another specimen (e.g., core biopsy, surgical resection, lymph node, and/or metastatic site). Because the decision to recommend HER2-targeted therapy requires a HER2-positive test result, additional HER2 testing should be attempted in equivocal specimens to attempt to obtain a positive or negative HER2 test result and most accurately determine the HER2 status of the tumor specimen. <br />

            <sup>g</sup>Alternatively, a laboratory accredited by the CAP or another accrediting entity may choose to use an LDT, in which case its analytical performance must be documented in the same clinical laboratory that will use the assay, and documentation of analytical validity of the assay must be available.&nbsp;<br />

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library electronic databases were searched with the date parameters of January 2006 through January 2013 for articles in English. The MEDLINE search terms are included in Data Supplement 3 in the original guideline document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), and a summary of the literature search results is provided in Data Supplement 4 of the original guideline document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Additional data were gathered from in-press publications and personal correspondence with researchers to address the issue of mandatory testing if a test result is 0 or 1+.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence if they met the following criteria: (1) the study compared, prospectively or retrospectively, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) results or other tests; described technical comparisons across various assay platforms; examined potential testing algorithms for HER2 testing; or examined the correlation of HER2 status in primary versus metastatic tumors from the same patients; (2) the study population consisted of patients with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer; or (3) the primary outcomes included the negative predictive value (NPV) or positive predictive value (PPV) of ISH and IHC assays used to determine HER2 status, alone and in combination; negative and positive concordance across platforms; and accuracy in determining HER2 status and benefit from anti-HER2 therapy and in determining sensitivity and specificity of individual tests. Consideration was given to studies that directly compared results across assay platforms.</p>
<p>Studies were not limited to randomized controlled trials but also included other study types, including cohort designs, case series, evaluation studies, and comparative studies. The Update Committee also reviewed other testing guidelines and proficiency strategies of various US and international organizations, including unpublished data. Letters, commentaries, and editorials were reviewed for any new information. Case reports were excluded. The clinical questions addressed in the update are available in Data Supplement 5 in the original guideline document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>In 2007, a joint Expert Panel convened by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) met to develop guidelines for when and how to test for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (<em>HER2</em>) gene (also referred to as <em>ERBB2</em>), which is amplified and/or overexpressed in approximately 15% to 20% of primary breast cancers. Since then, minor clarifications and updates to the ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guideline have been issued. A detailed rationale for this full 2013 update, as well as additional background information, is available in Data Supplement 1 of the original guideline document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>In 2012, ASCO and CAP convened an Update Committee to conduct a formal and comprehensive review of the peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 and to revise the guideline recommendations as appropriate.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;HER2 testing Update Committee (see Appendix Table A1 in the original guideline document) met three times via Webinars coordinated by its Steering Committee to review the data published from January 2006 to January 2013 and to revise the recommendations. Draft manuscripts were circulated by e-mail, and the Update Committee approved the final manuscript.</p></div>
