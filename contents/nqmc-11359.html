<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of emergency department (ED) acute ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke patients who arrive at the ED within 2 hours of the onset of symptoms who have a head computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed during the stay and having a time from ED arrival to interpretation of the head CT or MRI scan within 45 minutes of arrival.</p></div>
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Improved access to diagnostic imaging assists clinicians in the decision making process and treatment plans. Over 143,579 people die each year from stroke (The Internet Stroke Center, 2009). Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Each year, about 795,000 people suffer a stroke. About 600,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent attacks (Lloyd-Jones et al., 2009). Decreasing radiology turnaround times will enhance decision making capabilities for patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or acute ischemic stroke. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) for treatment of acute ischemic stroke when given within three hours of stroke symptom onset (Brott et al., 2000). Of all strokes, 87 percent are ischemic, 10 percent are intracerebral hemorrhage, and 3 percent are subarachnoid hemorrhage (Hacke et al., 2004). Because of the therapeutic time window for treatment possibilities, timely completion and results of the computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan are imperative and play a role in determining the quality of care a patient receives. Clinical consensus indicates that stroke treatment is most effective when administered rapidly based on interpretation of real-time intracranial imaging. </p>
<p>Improved access to diagnostics assists clinicians in decision making. Diagnostic imaging and laboratory reports are expected to increase length of stay in the emergency department. Radiology report turnaround time can impact patient throughput times in the emergency department (DeFlorio et al., 2008). Decreasing radiology report turnaround times can have impacts across the facility and assist in reducing the length of stay and enhancing decision making capabilities for patient treatment plans (Marquez, 2005). Efficiencies in throughput with tasks can lead to less diversion, less overcrowding, less elopements, and less financial loss (Falvo et al., 2007).</p></div>
