<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve the function of patients age 18 years and older with chronic pain.</p>
<p>Physical rehabilitation is one of the basic level I core principles for managing patients with chronic pain. Goals are to provide the patient with tools for managing pain and restore function. It is important to use a multidimensional pain inventory as well as a functional activities tool. A patient-centered approach encourages the patient to be an active participant in the treatment program.</p>
<p>Cognitive-behavioral approaches to the rehabilitation of patients with persistent and unremitting chronic pain are considered to be among the most helpful available. Patients may be referred to a cognitive-behavioral therapist, counselor, social worker or psychologist for treatment (Waters et al., 2004). The goals of cognitive-behavioral strategies in the management of chronic pain are to improve physical functioning, assist patients in returning to work, reduce disability, reduce pain-related fear/avoidance, and reduce psychological distress and depression (Eccleston et al., 2003).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Chronic pain affects at least 50 million adults a year. Prevalence in primary care settings range from 5% to 33% and often imposes upon clinicians the responsibility of managing a substantial disability that can be exacerbated by a patient's distress. Due to its prevalence, the cost of chronic pain is substantial; it has been estimated at $70 billion per year. Chronic pain has the ability to disable and significantly decrease the quality of life for the individual and his or her support systems; the financial and personal cost to those who are affected by chronic pain is significant (Reid et al., 2002; Olsen &amp; Daumit, 2002).</p></div>
