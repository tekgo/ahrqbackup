The search terms used in PubMed were: <em>cauda equina syndrome, cauda equina syndrome and treatment, cauda equina syndrome and diagnosis, cauda equina syndrome and evidence-based medicine</em>. The search was filtered to select English language and humans, in the past five years. The studies reviewed were case articles, case reports, and case series studies (of class III/IV evidence).

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline is intended as an educational resource for physicians who treat injured workers in the Washington workers' compensation system under Title 51 Revised Code of Washington (RCW). The guideline serves as a review criteria for the Department's utilization review team to help ensure diagnosis and treatment of cauda equina syndrome is of the highest quality.

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Most guidelines are implemented within the utilization review (UR) program. Labor and Industries (L&amp;I) guidelines have priority over other proprietary guidelines and criteria that may exist. Where L&amp;I guidelines are not available, proprietary ones may be used. Reviewers apply each guideline as a standard for the majority of requests in the Washington workers' compensation program. For the minority of workers who appear to fall outside of the guideline and whose complexity of clinical findings exceeds the specificity of the guideline, further review by a physician is conducted.</p>
<p>When a surgical procedure is requested for a patient who meets the guideline criteria, the reviewer will recommend approval to the claim manager. If the criteria are not met, the request will be referred to a physician consultant who will review the patient's file, offer to discuss the case with the requesting physician, and make a recommendation to the claim manager. The flexibility built into this decision-making process helps legitimize the work of the subcommittee in the eyes of practicing physicians in Washington.</p>
<p>Completed guidelines will be communicated to practicing physicians via L&amp;I's website and through its <a href="http://www.lni.wa.gov/Main/Listservs/Provider.asp" title="Washington State Department of L and I Web site" target="_blank">provider listserv</a>. Education and training will be provided to reviewers and staff to ensure their proper application within the UR program. Where possible, continuing medical education (CME) credits may be offered.</p></div>
