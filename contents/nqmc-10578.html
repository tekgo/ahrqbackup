<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of calls received by the organization's Member Services call centers (during operating hours) during the measurement year that were answered by a live voice within 30 seconds.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Health care providers, health plan members, and purchasers increasingly recognize the importance of customer service as a factor in patient satisfaction. Articles in medical journals, member satisfaction surveys (e.g., CAHPS, Caredata) and employer and payer requests for information and proposals are responding to demands to improve consumer health care experiences. </p>
<p>Customer service is an important dimension of the organization's ability to provide members with reasonable access to services. The ability to access customer service in a timely manner is the first step toward ensuring that the organization's Customer Service Department adequately meets members' needs. This sets the foundation for assessing quality of interaction between the organization and the member. Higher performance of this measure should improve member satisfaction and reduce employer cost of handling employee dissatisfaction with customer service.</p></div>

The number of calls received by the organization's Member Services call centers (during the hours of operation) during the measurement year where the member called directly into Member Services or selected a Member Services option and was put in the call queue</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: </p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Call</em>: Telephone contact initiated by an external caller connects with the organization's Member Services call center. For calls transferred from other parts of the organization's telephone system, measure time from after the call is transferred into the Member Services call center, the member chooses the option to speak to a Member Services representative and is placed in the call queue. </li>
    <li><em>Queue</em>: A sequence of calls waiting to be handled by the Member Services representative. The wait time on a queued call is calculated by Automatic Call Distribution (ACD), which tracks incoming calls. </li>
    <li>If an organization blocks calls during peak call periods (or regular business hours) by immediately giving members a busy signal and keeping the calls from reaching the call queue, the auditor assesses the percentage of blocked calls and its impact on the measure. </li>
    <li>If an organization's phone system tracks members' wait time and can call members back when it is their turn in the queue, include the call in the denominator; however, it will probably be noncompliant for the numerator because it is unlikely that the start of the call-back process would occur in the 30-second time frame. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Exclude calls to a benefits contractor (e.g., mental health, dental, vision, pharmacy) that uses its own call center.</p></div>
