<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends endoscopic dilation for patients with dysphagia secondary to benign intrinsic strictures of the esophagus. (++++) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends wire-guided dilation, preferably under fluoroscopic guidance, or through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilation for complex esophageal strictures. (+++O) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends antisecretory treatment in conjunction with dilation to reduce the recurrence rate of peptic strictures. (++++) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends that dilation for adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) be reserved for those who have a dominant esophageal stricture or ring and those who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy. (+++O) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee suggests adjunctive treatment with corticosteroid injection into recurrent or refractory benign esophageal peptic strictures. (++OO) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee suggests that esophageal stent placement be reserved for refractory esophageal strictures that do not respond to sequential dilation and/or steroid injection. (++OO) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends that both endoscopic and surgical treatment options for achalasia be discussed with the patient. In patients who opt for endoscopic management and are good surgical candidates,&nbsp;the Practice Committee recommends pneumatic dilation with large-caliber balloon dilators for the endoscopic treatment of achalasia. (++++) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends botulinum toxin injection for endoscopic treatment of achalasia in patients who are poor candidates for surgery or pneumatic dilation. (+++O) </li>

Potential Harms

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Dilation should be performed with caution in patients who have had a recent, healed perforation or upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. </li>
    <li>The main adverse events associated with dilation are perforation, bleeding, and aspiration. The perforation rate for esophageal strictures after dilation ranges from 0.1% to 0.4% and is higher with complex strictures and radiation-induced strictures. The perforation rate may be influenced by endoscopist experience. </li>

    <li>Guidelines for appropriate use of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus at the time that the guidelines are drafted. Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of this guideline. This guideline may be revised as necessary to account for changes in technology, new data, or other aspects of clinical practice. </li>
    <li>This guideline is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. This guideline is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment. Clinical decisions in any particular case involve a complex analysis of the patient's condition and available courses of action.
