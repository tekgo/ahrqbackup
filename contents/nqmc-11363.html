<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of thorax computed tomography (CT) studies performed with and without contrast ("combined studies") out of all thorax CT studies performed (those with contrast, those without contrast, and those with both). The measure is calculated based on a one-year window of claims data.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>As indicated by current clinical guidelines, there are limited compelling uses for combined (with and without contrast) computed tomography (CT) thorax studies. The use of combined CT thorax studies&mdash;defined as those that are performed both without and with contrast agents for the evaluation of the chest&mdash; represents a source of inefficient imaging use that also risks patient safety through exposure to unnecessary ionizing radiation and contrast material.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>During the measure development process, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) completed quantitative testing of the measure's specifications, including evaluation of the measure's scientific acceptability and feasibility of implementation by a Technical Expert Panel. A dry run, evaluating measure performance at each facility eligible for public reporting, was performed prior to measure implementation; no major stakeholder concerns were raised about the specifications, feasibility, or usability at that time. The measure was first endorsed by the National Quality Forum in 2008, and has maintained endorsement since that time.</p>
<p>CMS continues to monitor stakeholder inquiries for concerns about measure calculation or scientific acceptability; feedback received through this vehicle can feed into the measure update cycle, as is appropriate. In fall 2015, CMS completed a robust evaluation of the measure's importance, scientific acceptability (including reliability and validity), feasibility, and usability and use. </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Inclusions</strong><br />
The number of thorax computed tomography (CT) studies performed with contrast, without contrast, or both with and without contrast</p>
<p><em>Initial Patient Population</em>: This measure applies only to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in original, fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare who were treated as outpatients in hospital facilities reimbursed through the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). These measures do not include Medicare managed care beneficiaries, non-Medicare patients, or beneficiaries who were admitted to the hospital as inpatients. </p>
<p>Beneficiaries included in the measure's initial patient population had documentation of thorax CT studies (with contrast, without contrast, or both with and without contrast) performed at the hospital outpatient department within a one-year window of claims data. Beneficiaries can be included in the measure's initial patient population multiple times; each thorax CT study (with contrast, without contrast, or both with and without contrast) performed at a facility measured by OPPS is counted once in the measure's denominator.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Beneficiaries who have a clinical diagnosis of one or more conditions for which imaging is considered appropriate are excluded from the measure. </p>
<p>For this measure, beneficiaries with a history of any diagnosis codes from the following categories are excluded from the measure's initial patient population; these conditions include internal injury of chest, abdomen, and pelvis; injury to blood vessels; non-traumatic aortic disease; and, crushing injury. For these conditions, clinical evidence exists (within a practice guideline or the peer-reviewed literature) that indicates performing combined CT thorax studies may be appropriate care. Consequently, any beneficiary with one or more of these conditions is excluded from the measure.</p>
