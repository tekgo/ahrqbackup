<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>General Population Issues: Overweight and Obesity</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Data from the National Center for Health Statistics show that 30&#37; of U.S. adults 20 years of age and older--over 60 million--people are obese.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Metabolic Effects Associated with Overweight or Obese Conditions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Increases in adiposity, particularly visceral abdominal fat, are associated with decreases in insulin sensitivity in individuals both with and without psychiatric disease.</li>
<li>Increasing prevalence rates of overweight or obese individuals raise concerns regarding the risks of many health conditions associated with insulin resistance, including hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia leading to Type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bipolar Disorder and Weight Gain</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The estimated prevalence of obesity in persons with bipolar disorder ranges from 13.0-49.0% in various studies; with an unknown percentage attributable to lifestyle-related issues associated with the condition.</li>
<li>Treatment with pharmacotherapy associated with bipolar disorder, particularly the various antipsychotics, has been associated with an additional increase in weight ranging from less than 2 lbs up to 10 lbs.</li>

<ul>
<li>The STABLE measures were developed using the RAND Appropriateness Method and have been shown to have content validity and face validity.</li>
<li>Data feasibility testing was performed to determine the availability of the data elements required in the measure numerator and denominator specifications.</li>
<li>Inter-abstractor reliability testing was performed to assess the data collection strategy. The data collection strategy included data collection forms; data dictionary references and abstractor instructions.</li>
<li>A field study was conducted to determine measure conformance in an appropriate convenience sample.</li>
