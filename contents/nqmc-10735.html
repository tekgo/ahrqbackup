Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients transferred to another healthcare facility whose medical record documentation indicated that all of the relevant elements were communicated to the receiving hospital within 60 minutes of discharge (administrative communication must occur before discharge/transfer).</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This measure includes the following subsections:
    <ul class="Indent" style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Administrative communication </li>
        <li>Patient information </li>
        <li>Vital signs </li>
        <li>Medication information </li>
        <li>Physician or practitioner generated information </li>
        <li>Nurse generated information </li>
        <li>Procedures and tests </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Measure Calculation</strong>: This measure is calculated using an all-or-none approach. The overall Emergency Department Transfer Communication (EDTC) measure can be calculated as the percent of medical records that met <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> of the 27 data elements. Data elements not appropriate for an individual patient are scored as NA (not applicable), are counted in the measure as a positive, or 'yes,' response, and the patient will meet that element criteria. That patient will either need to meet the criteria for all of the data elements or have an NA. </li>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Communication problems are a major contributing factor to adverse events in hospitals, accounting for 65% of sentinel events tracked by The Joint Commission. In addition, research indicates that deficits exist in the transfer of patient information between hospitals and primary care physicians in the community, and between hospitals and long-term facilities. Transferred patients are excluded from the calculation of most national quality measures, such as those used in Hospital Compare. The Hospital Compare Web site was created to display rates of Process of Care measures using data that are voluntarily submitted by hospitals.</p>
<p>The Joint Commission has adopted National Patient Safety Goal 2, "Improve the Effectiveness of Communication Among Caregivers." This goal required all accredited hospitals to implement a standardized approach to hand-off communications, including nursing and physician handoffs from the emergency department (ED) to inpatient units, other hospitals, and other types of health care facilities. The process must include a method of communicating up-to-date information regarding the patient's care, treatment, and services; condition; and any recent or anticipated changes.</p>
<p>Limited attention has been paid to the development and implementation of quality measures specifically focused on patient transfers between EDs and other facilities. These measures are important for all health care facilities, but especially so for small rural hospitals that transfer a higher proportion of ED patients to other hospitals than larger urban facilities.</p>
<p>While many aspects of hospital quality are similar for urban and rural hospitals (e.g., providing heart attack patients with aspirin), the urban/rural contextual differences result in differences in emphasis on quality measurement. Because of its role in linking residents to urban referral centers, important aspects of rural hospital quality include triage-and-transfer decision making about when to provide a particular type of care, transporting patients, and coordinating information flow to specialists beyond the community.</p>
<p>Emergency care is important in all hospitals, but it is particularly important in rural hospitals. Because of their size, rural hospitals are less likely to be able to provide more specialized services, such as cardiac catheterization or trauma surgery. Rural residents often need to travel greater distances than urban residents to get to a hospital initially. In addition, their initial point of contact is less likely to have specialized services and staff found in tertiary care centers, so they are also more likely to be transferred. These size and geographic realities increase the importance of organizing triage, stabilization, and transfer in rural hospitals which, in turn, suggest that measurement of these processes is an important issue for rural hospitals.</p>
<p>The Emergency Department Transfer Communication measures aim to provide a means of assessing how well key patient information is communicated from an ED to any healthcare facility. They are applicable to patients with a wide range of medical conditions (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, respiratory compromise and trauma) and are relevant for both internal quality improvement purposes and external reporting to consumers and purchasers. The results of the field tests (see the "Extent of Measure Testing" field) suggest that significant opportunity exists for improvement on these measures.</p>
<p>Timely, accurate and direct communication facilitates the handoff to the receiving facility, provides continuity of care, and avoids medical errors and redundant tests.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Nearly 19% of rural hospital admissions and 13% of urban hospital admissions are transferred to another facility. </li>
    <li>Patient safety studies have identified the emergency department (ED) as the location within a hospital that has the highest percentage of preventable and negligent adverse events. Increasing attention is being paid to prevention of medical errors in ED settings, but considerable work still needs to be done to develop performance measures for ED care (Schenkel, 2000; Welch et al., 2006). </li>
    <li>The ED patient transfer communication measure set incorporates conceptual elements from the Federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act and the Continuity of Care Record (CCR). The CCR is a standard specification developed jointly by the American Society for Testing and Materials International, the Massachusetts Medical Society, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), and the American Academy of Family Physicians. It is intended to foster and improve continuity of patient care, to reduce medical errors, and to ensure at least a minimum standard of health information transportability when a patient is referred to, transferred to, or otherwise seen by another provider. The objective of the CCR is to improve continuity of care, reduce medical errors, and ensure secure health information transportability when a patient is referred or transferred to another provider (American Academy of Family Physicians, 2011). </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In previous work, a model for measuring rural hospital quality was developed, with a focus on the special issues posed by the rural hospital context (Moscovice et al., 2004). The development of rural relevant hospital quality measures was completed over several steps. With the assistance of expert panels consisting of rural hospital and hospital quality measurement experts, an initial core set of quality measures relevant to rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds was identified. Established hospital quality measures were examined and the list consolidated.</p>
<p>The team evaluated existing quality indicator and performance measurement systems to assess their relevance for rural hospitals. Existing quality indicator and performance measurement systems (e.g., those developed by The Joint Commission, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], National Quality Forum [NQF], Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services [CMS]) and four rural-oriented performance measurement systems, Apples to Apples, Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative, Maryland Hospital Association QI Project, Georgia Hospital Association CARE, were reviewed. Four criteria were used to evaluate rural hospital quality measures:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Prevalence in rural hospitals with less than 50 beds </li>
    <li>Ease of data collection effort in rural hospitals with less than 50 beds </li>
    <li>Internal usefulness for rural hospitals with less than 50 beds </li>
    <li>External usefulness for rural hospitals with less than 50 beds </li>
</ul>
<p>The research partners further refined this draft set of existing quality measures to fit the rural context and identified emergency department care as both an important quality assessment measurement category for rural hospitals and missing from existing measurement sets.</p>
<p>Throughout the field studies, strong emphasis was placed on obtaining expert and hospital staff insights. Evaluation of the measures, data collection, report usefulness, and the overall process was requested from hospital representatives at many points. Hospital, network, quality improvement organization (QIO) and consulting staff were asked to maintain a log of comments regarding the project including suggestions for improvements. Feedback forms and contact information for participants involved in this project were provided during training sessions. Each time a hospital was contacted, comments were requested regarding the project. Hospitals were invited to call the QIO, network, consulting or university staff at any time with questions, comments, or concerns. Three expert panels were convened to review data and measurement definitions and specifications.</p>
<p>The three field tests of rural hospital quality measures were conducted in 2004, 2006, and 2008 to access the feasibility of data collection, the ease of different data collection methods, the usefulness of the measures for improvement and reporting, and three different training mechanisms. The measures were field tested in 68 rural hospitals in eight states. Twenty-two rural hospitals participated in the first field test of the measures, including 14 hospitals in Minnesota, 4 hospitals in Utah, and 4 hospitals in Nevada. Staff members from these hospitals were trained in person in measurement abstraction by University of Minnesota and Stratis Health QIO staff. For the second field test, the University of Minnesota and Stratis Health collaborated with the Washington Rural Health Quality Network (RHQN). A total of 18 rural hospitals in Washington State participated. This field test used a "Train the Trainer" method to disseminate the measurement abstraction information. The University of Minnesota and Stratis Health staff trained RHQN staff, who in turn trained hospital staff in small group settings. For the third field test the University of Minnesota collaborated with PMI and Stroudwater Consultants. Three different training methods were used: direct training, train the trainer and video training. Overall, the elements of the transfer communication measure were found to be easily abstracted and to provide many opportunities for documentation and communication improvement. These results suggest that quality improvement in rural hospitals is feasible and useful for reporting and improvement when hospital staff are appropriately trained and provided ongoing technical support.</p></div>

<p class="Note"><strong>Measure Calculation</strong>:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This measure is calculated using an all-or-none approach. The overall Emergency Department Transfer Communication (EDTC) measure can be calculated as the percent of medical records that met <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> of the 27 data elements. Data elements not appropriate for an individual patient are scored as NA (not applicable), are counted in the measure as a positive, or 'yes,' response, and the patient will meet that element criteria. That patient will either need to meet the criteria for all of the data elements or have an NA. </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Considerations for Electronic Transfer of Information</strong>:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For health systems with shared electronic medical records, documentation must indicate that data elements had been entered into the data system and were available to the receiving facility prior to transfer for Administrative Communication Measures or within 60 minutes of discharge for all other measures. If there are not shared records, "sent" means that medical record documentation indicates the information went with the patient via fax, phone, or internet/electronic health record. </li>
</ul>
