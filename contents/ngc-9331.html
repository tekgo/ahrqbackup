Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (A, B, C, U) and classification of the evidence (Class I-IV) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>If Huntington disease (HD) chorea requires treatment, clinicians should prescribe tetrabenazine (TBZ) (up to 100 mg/day), amantadine (300&ndash;400 mg/day), or riluzole (200 mg/ day) (<strong>Level B</strong>). TBZ likely has very important antichoreic benefits, and riluzole 200 mg/day likely has moderate benefits (<strong>Level B</strong>). The degree of benefit for amantadine is unknown. Clinicians should discuss possible adverse events (AEs) with patients with HD and monitor for their occurrence, particularly parkinsonism and depression/suicidality with TBZ and elevated liver enzymes with riluzole. </li>
    <li>Clinicians may prescribe nabilone for modest decreases in HD chorea (<strong>Level C</strong>), but information is insufficient to recommend long-term use, particularly given abuse potential concerns (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>Whereas riluzole 200 mg/day likely decreases chorea, clinicians should not prescribe riluzole 100 mg/day for moderate short-term benefits (<strong>Level B</strong>) or for any long-term (3-year) HD antichoreic goals (<strong>Level B</strong>). Modest short-term benefits of riluzole 100 mg/day cannot be excluded. </li>
    <li>Clinicians may choose not to prescribe ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (ethyl-EPA) (<strong>Level B</strong>), minocycline (<strong>Level B</strong>), or creatine (<strong>Level C</strong>) for very important improvements in HD chorea. Moderate antichoreic benefits cannot be excluded. </li>
    <li>Clinicians may choose not to prescribe coenzyme Q10 (<strong>Level B</strong>) for moderate improvements in HD chorea. Modest antichoreic benefits cannot be excluded. </li>
    <li>Data are insufficient to make recommendations regarding use of clozapine, other neuroleptics, or donepezil for HD chorea treatment (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence Scheme for Therapeutic Interventions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p>The following are also required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for drop-outs (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and cross-overs with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias </li>
    <li>For noninferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or non-inferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. (e.g. for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the results of the study is based upon a per protocol analysis that takes into account dropouts or crossovers. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A randomized controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a-e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b-e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.**</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus or expert opinion.</p>
<p class="Note">* Note that numbers 1-3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class="Note">**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt; 5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt; 2).</p></div>

<p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: subjects with genetically confirmed Huntington disease (HD) or HD clinical features plus confirmed family history, a comparison group, an available pharmacologic intervention, measurement of chorea change using a validated outcome measure, and &ge;20 patients. Studies with primary neuroprotective or tolerability endpoints were included if chorea was a secondary endpoint.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>MEDLINE was searched from January 2011 to July 2015 using the search terms Huntington's disease OR Huntington chorea.

<p>For this evidence-based guideline, the Guideline Development Subcommittee (GDS) asked the following question: For adult patients with HD requiring symptomatic chorea therapy, what available pharmacologic agents effectively reduce chorea as measured by validated scales?</p>
<p>Recommendations were linked to the strength of the evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) member who had expertise in neurologic disease conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists.</p></div>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields.
