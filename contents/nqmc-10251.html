<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The prevalence of psychiatric and behavioral health comorbidities in patients with epilepsy is well documented and the relationship between epilepsy and psychiatric and behavioral health disorders is complex (England et al., 2012). Cognitive dysfunction is also a major concern for all people with epilepsy (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2012; Kobau et al., 2012; Vingerhoets, 2006). A gap remains between early detection, treatment, and prevention of psychiatric, cognitive, and social comorbidities in epilepsy (Lin, Mula, &amp; Herman, 2012). Patients with epilepsy report dissatisfaction with life overall and perceive limitations in their social and emotional support (Kobau et al., 2012).</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>If a person with epilepsy is found to have evidence of a mood disorder (e.g., depression, anxiety), then s/he should receive treatment or a referral for mental health care (Pugh et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>A person with epilepsy should receive screening for depression at least once each year (Pugh et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>It is recommended that mutual support groups for parents/families of vulnerable pediatric patients (i.e., children with intractable epilepsy) in the inpatient care setting be developed, implemented and evaluated. The evidence demonstrates that parent support groups can: improve parental attitudes, increase parental knowledge, decrease parental anxiety (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 2009). </li>
    <li>If seizures are not controlled and/or there is diagnostic uncertainty or treatment failure, children, young people and adults should be referred to tertiary services soon for further assessment. Referral should be considered when one or more of the following criteria are present: &hellip;There is psychological and/or psychiatric co-morbidity (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Maintain a high level of vigilance for treatment-emergent adverse effects (for example, bone health issues and neuropsychiatric issues). Treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is associated with a small risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior; available data suggest that the increased risk applies to all AEDs and may be seen as early as 1 week after starting treatment (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>In making a care plan for a child, young person or adult with) learning disabilities and epilepsy, particular attention should be paid to the possibility of adverse cognitive and behavioral effects of AED therapy (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Neuropsychological assessment should be considered in children, young people and adults in whom it is important to evaluate learning disabilities and cognitive dysfunction, particularly in regard to language and memory (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Psychological interventions (relaxation, cognitive behavior therapy, biofeedback) may be used in conjunction with AED therapy in adults where either the person or the specialist considers seizure control to be inadequate with optimal AED therapy. This approach may be associated with an improved quality of life in some people (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Psychological interventions (relaxation, cognitive behavior therapy) may be used in children and young people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy (NICE, 2012). </li>
    <li>Psychological interventions may be used as adjunctive therapy (NICE, 2012). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>This measure was created to ensure all patients, pediatric and adult, receive timely and standardized screening, thereby increasing the likelihood of early intervention and treatment which should increase patient's quality of life. Given the psychiatric and cognitive burdens, routine screening should be a standard component for pediatric and adult care. Brief, uniform screening is needed to identify patients at risk and standardize their access to care (Lin, Mula, &amp; Herman, 2012). Routine screening and interventions are not currently being performed. Implementation of this measure will increase screening rates, and thereby improve treatment of behavioral health comorbidities.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy data is lacking. In 2012, the Institute of Medicine released <em>Epilepsy across the Spectrum: Promoting Health and Understanding</em>, detailing epilepsy research disparities and highlighting specific areas where further research is needed, including the extent of epilepsy, consequences, comorbid conditions and outcomes of epilepsy (England et al., 2012). The following statistics only touch on the magnitude of epilepsy given lack of research and stigma: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It is estimated 2.2 million people in the United States are diagnosed with epilepsy, and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the United States annually (England et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Epilepsy prevalence might be underestimated because of underreporting associated with repercussions and stigma in disclosing epilepsy (Kobau et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Common comorbidities among people with epilepsy include somatic (i.e., fractures, asthma, diabetes, and heart disease), neurological (i.e., stroke, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorders, chronic pain), and mental health conditions (i.e., mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, anxiety disorders, suicidality) (England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>It is estimated the number of people with epilepsy who die of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) range from 1 of every 10,000 who are newly diagnosed to 9 of every 1,000 candidates for epilepsy surgery (England et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>People with epilepsy are more likely to be unemployed or unable to work, have low annual household incomes, be obese and physically inactive, and to smoke (England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>People with epilepsy have poorer overall health status, impaired intellectual and physical functioning, a greater risk for accidents and injuries, and negative side effects from seizure medications (Fountain et al., 2011; England et al., 2012; Kobau et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>It is estimated the annual direct medical cost of epilepsy in the United States is $9.6 billion. This estimate does not include community service costs or indirect costs from losses in quality of life and productivity (England et al., 2012). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunities for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Additional data on opportunities for improvement and gaps in care specific to the epilepsy measures can be located in the updated epilepsy measures. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A review of 261 patient responses using the PatientsLikeMe survey system indicated a gap remains between recommended care detailed in the 2009 epilepsy measurement set and the care delivered to patients with epilepsy (Wicks &amp; Fountain, 2012). </li>
    <li>The Institute of Medicine noted several gaps in care and opportunities for improvement, including 1) timely referrals and access to treatments, 2) epilepsy care and prevention, 3) education of persons with epilepsy and their families, and 4) the stigma of epilepsy (England et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Surgery continues to be heavily underutilized as a treatment for epilepsy, with significant disparities by race and insurance coverage (Englot et al., 2012). </li>
