Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the strength of evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>A-C</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>In adult patients with suspected transient ischemic attack (TIA), are there clinical decision rules that can identify patients at very low short-term risk for stroke who can be safely discharged from the emergency department (ED)?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. In adult patients with suspected TIA, do not rely on current existing risk stratification instruments (e.g., age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of TIA and presence of diabetes [ABCD2] score) to identify TIA patients who can be safely discharged from the ED.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In adult patients with suspected TIA, what imaging can be safely delayed from the initial ED workup?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. (1) The safety of delaying neuroimaging from the initial ED workup is unknown. If noncontrast brain MRI is not readily available, it is reasonable for physicians to obtain a noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) as part of the initial TIA workup to identify TIA mimics (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion). However, noncontrast head CT should not be used to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke. (2) When feasible, physicians should obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke. (3) When feasible, physicians should obtain cervical vascular imaging (e.g., carotid ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography [CTA], or magnetic resonance angiography [MRA]) to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In adult patients with suspected TIA, is carotid ultrasonography as accurate as neck CTA or MRA in identifying severe carotid stenosis?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. In adult patients with suspected TIA, carotid ultrasonography may be used to exclude severe carotid stenosis because it has accuracy similar to that of MRA or CTA.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In adult patients with suspected TIA, can a rapid ED-based diagnostic protocol safely identify patients at short-term risk for stroke?</strong>
    <p><strong><em>Level A recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level B recommendations</em></strong>. In adult patients with suspected TIA without high-risk conditions,* a rapid ED-based diagnostic protocol may be used to evaluate patients at short-term risk for stroke.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Level C recommendations</em></strong>. None specified.</p>
    <p class="Note">*High-risk conditions include abnormal initial head CT result (if obtained), suspected embolic source (presence of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, or valvulopathy), known carotid stenosis, previous large stroke, and crescendo TIA.</p>

<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Level A recommendations</strong>. Generally accepted principles for patient care that reﬂect a high degree of clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level B recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reﬂect moderate clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level C recommendations</strong>. Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances where consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Assessment of Classes of Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p>All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least 2 methodologists and assigned a Class of Evidence. Each article was assigned a design class with design 1 representing the strongest study design and subsequent design classes (i.e., design 2, design 3) representing respectively weaker study designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic clinical reports, or meta-analyses (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, such as randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, sample size, and generalizability. Using a predetermined process related to the study's design, methodological quality, and applicability to the critical question, articles received a final Class of Evidence grade (i.e., Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles identified with fatal flaws or that were ultimately not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade "X" and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the specific critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question for which it is being considered. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different Classes of Evidence as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-specific Classes of Evidence grading may be found in the Evidentiary Table in the original guideline document.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of <em>Annals of Emergency Medicine</em> and its editors. </li>
    <li>This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of adults with suspected transient ischemic attack (TIA) but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. </li>
    <li>It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain adequate empirical data to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. </li>
    <li>This clinical policy is not intended to represent a legal standard of care for emergency physicians. Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic or management options available to the emergency physician. ACEP recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment and patient preferences. This guideline defines for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the critical questions addressed in this policy. </li>
