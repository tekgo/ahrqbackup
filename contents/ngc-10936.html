<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Target Population</span></strong> </p>
<p>Adult patients (age &ge;18 years) who have suspected low grade diffuse glioma.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> </p>
<p>What are the optimal neuropathological techniques to diagnose low grade diffuse glioma in the adult?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Level I</em>. Histopathological analysis of a representative surgical sample of the lesion should be used to provide the diagnosis of low grade diffuse glioma. </li>
    <li><em>Level III</em>. Both frozen section and cytopathologic/smear evaluation should be used to aid the intra-operative assessment of low grade diffuse glioma diagnosis. A resection specimen is preferred over a biopsy specimen, to minimize the potential for sampling error issues. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Target Population</span></strong> </p>
<p>Patients with histologically proven World Health Organization (WHO) grade II diffuse glioma.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> </p>
<p>In adult patients (age &ge;18 years) with histologically-proven WHO grade II diffuse glioma, is testing for IDH1 mutation (R132H and/or others) warranted? If so, is there a preferred method?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> </p>
<p><em>Level II</em>. IDH gene mutation assessment, via IDH1 R132H antibody and/or IDH1/2 mutation hotspot sequencing, is highly-specific for low grade diffuse glioma, and is recommended as an additional test for classification and prognosis. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Target Population</strong></span> </p>
<p>Patients with histologically proven WHO grade II diffuse glioma.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> </p>
<p>In adult patients (age &ge;18 years) with histologically proven WHO grade II diffuse glioma, is testing for 1p/19q loss warranted? If so, is there a preferred method? </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> </p>
<p><em>Level III</em>. 1p/19q loss-of-heterozygosity testing, by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is recommended as an additional test in oligodendroglial cases for prognosis and potential treatment planning. </p>

<p>Patients with histologically proven WHO grade II diffuse glioma.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> </p>
<p>In adult patients (age &ge;18 years) with histologically proven WHO grade II diffuse glioma, is methyl-guanine methyl-transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation testing warranted? If so, is there a preferred method?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> </p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend MGMT promoter methylation testing as a routine for low grade diffuse gliomas. It is recommended that patients be enrolled in properly designed clinical trials to assess the value of this and related markers for this target population. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Target Population</span></strong> </p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Examination Approach</strong></p>
<p>A wide-ranging literature search strategy was undertaken to identify all citations relevant to the management of low grade gliomas. The MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from 1990 through 2012, with additional data being gleaned from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. The search strategies used a combination of subheadings and text words with the specifics of this work being outlined in each guideline section. Reference lists of the publications chosen for full text review were also screened for potentially relevant studies.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
The search of the bibliographic databases identified possibly relevant citations for a given topic and often these were large in number. The eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria to screen the citations for each of the questions were determined ahead of time for each section by the writing group. At least two authors evaluated the titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria with broad interpretation of the criteria being used initially so as to maximize the likelihood of capturing pertinent information. Cases of disagreement about pertinence were resolved by a third author when needed. The full text articles of the selected abstracts were then collected and the same process of applying the eligibility criteria was carried out again with the more in depth information available. Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections. Reasons for exclusion for papers were also documented so as to be able to discuss pertinent problem citations in the scientific foundation as needed.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Specific Search Strategy for This Guideline</strong></span></p>
<p>The authors searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1983 to 2011 using the following search terms: "glioma AND pathology", "oligodendroglioma AND pathology", "astrocytoma AND pathology", "LGG AND pathology", "glioma AND diagnosis", "oligodendroglioma AND diagnosis", "astrocytoma AND diagnosis", "LGG AND diagnosis". This resulted in the identification of 262 unique articles, 10 of which met eligibility criteria (below). In addition, they performed PubMed searches of the National Library of Medicine database 1/1/1990&ndash;12/31/2012, using the following terms: "low-grade [All Fields] AND ("glioma"[MeSH Terms] OR "glioma"[All Fields]) AND ("pathology" [Subheading] OR "pathology"[All Fields] OR "pathology" [MeSH Terms])". This resulted in 2208 articles, which were reviewed yielding 163 potentially eligible articles. Links to "related articles" from highly relevant studies were utilized to broaden the search. Articles were also identified from the reference lists from references uncovered in initial searches. The references from prior evidence-based reports on low-grade diffuse and malignant glioma were also analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion criteria for literature included studies on low-grade diffuse gliomas (defined as astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and oligo-astrocytomas) in populations of patients 18 years and older. The authors excluded articles due to primary focus on higher-grade glioma (i.e., anaplastic gliomas and glioblastomas), optic glioma or pilocytic astrocytoma, non-English language, pediatric patients, trials of therapy, case-reports or small (&lt;5) patient cohorts, and papers where data reported on high grade gliomas and low-grade diffuse gliomas could not be separated in the analysis.</p>
<p>Reviewers evaluated citation abstracts using the above a priori criteria for relevance. The same methodology was used for full-text screening of potentially relevant papers. </p></div>

<p>Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections.

<p>Studies which met the eligibility criteria were subject to more detailed scrutiny and had their data extracted by one reviewer and the extracted information was checked by one or more other reviewers. Evidence and summary tables, reporting the extracted study information and evidence classification, were generated for all of the included studies for each of the questions. Evidence tables were created with most recent data first and subsequent listings in retrograde chronological order. The table headings consisted of first author name and year, followed by a brief study description, chosen data class and conclusion. The authors were directed to craft the data in the tables in a succinct and fact filled manner so as to allow for understanding of the literature entry. The literature in the evidence tables was expanded upon in the scientific foundation of each section so as to emphasize important points supporting its classification and contribution to recommendations. The method by which this was accomplished is expanded upon in the Joint Guideline Committee Guideline Development Methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Internal drafts of the tables and manuscripts were developed by sharing between writers electronically, by telephone and meetings. Summary and conclusion statements were included for each section, with comments on key issues for future investigation being added where pertinent.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guideline Panel Development</strong></span></p>
<p>Recognizing the serious nature of low grade gliomas along with the lack of consensus among various treatment options, the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) recommended that evidence-based guidelines be developed as a top priority, for the diagnosis, management and treatment of low grade glioma patients. The objectives of these guidelines are to establish the best evidence-based management of low grade gliomas in terms of imaging diagnosis, use of surgical biopsy and resection, assessment of tumor pathology, administration of systemic chemotherapy, and administration of radiation therapy. Because these tumors dependably recur or progress despite standard therapy, the Joint Tumor Section also recommended an evidence-based guideline be developed for progressive low grade gliomas and that information on promising emerging therapies be assessed in the same manner to determine the possible application of these findings.</p>
<p>Having identified the topical objectives, the Guidelines Committee of the Joint Tumor Section then recruited experts in the field from each of the parent organizations as lead writers of each section. These writers, in turn, recruited experts in non-neurosurgical specialties relevant to the field of management and therapy chosen. Writers were provided training on the method of guideline development as used in this guideline set by written methods and instructions. The senior authors and CNS Guidelines Manager then worked with them on a step by step basis to confirm that the methods were followed as the literature was collected, assessed and documents developed. When writers were approached and preliminarily agreed to participate they were asked to complete a formal conflict of interest questionnaire confirming the appropriateness of their participation. At that point they also agreed to report any new conflicts of interest that might develop during the writing process. In this manner a multidisciplinary panel of writers referred to as the Low Grade Glioma Guidelines Task Force was assembled, with significant administrative, logistical and analytical support from the national CNS Guidelines Committee. The method of this evidence-based clinical practice parameter guideline has been written in a manner to be as transparent as possible using published assessment criteria.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Topic Range of This Systematic Review and Clinical Practice Guideline</strong></span></p>
<p>Having identified writing groups for each topic, the members designed questions to allow assessment of the literature in a manner that would provide guidance for management of low grade gliomas. These questions are presented at the beginning of each of the eight guideline chapters spanning the topics of imaging assessment, diagnostic biopsy, surgical resection, tumor evaluation by standard neuropathology and molecular techniques, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, emerging therapies and treatment of recurrent or progressive low grade gliomas.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise, in order to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Approval Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The completed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of low grade gliomas were presented to the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) for review. The reviewers for the Joint Guidelines Committee were vetted by the <em>Journal of Neuro-oncology</em> for suitability and expertise to serve as reviewers for the purposes of publication in that journal also. The final product was then approved and endorsed by the executive committees of both the AANS and CNS prior to publication in the <em>Journal of Neuro-oncology</em>.</p>
<p>The funding agencies (CNS Executive Committee and AANS/CNS Joint Tumor Section Executive Committee) were permitted to review these guidelines only after the Joint Guidelines Committee had completed its extensive review, critique and ultimate approval process; the funding groups then were limited to whether or not to endorse or reject this body of work but substantive changes were not allowed.</p></div>

Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Two publications provide comparison of cytological/smear techniques and histological techniques, both highlighting the potential benefit of both frozen section histology in addition to cytological/smear preparations for diagnostic accuracy, providing class III evidence. </li>
    <li>One of the clear-cut benefits of IDH1 R132H antibody testing is the ability to sharpen the diagnostic boundaries between diffusely infiltrative low-grade diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, and other neoplastic and non-neoplastic mimics. </li>
