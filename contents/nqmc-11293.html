Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percent of acute care hospitalized inpatients age 6 months and older discharged during October, November, December, January, February, or March who were screened for seasonal influenza immunization status and were vaccinated prior to discharge, if indicated.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Influenza (flu) is an acute, contagious, viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs (respiratory illness) caused by influenza viruses. Outbreaks of seasonal influenza occur annually during late autumn and winter months although the timing and severity of outbreaks can vary substantially from year to year and community to community. Influenza activity most often peaks in February, but can peak rarely as early as November and as late as April. In order to protect as many people as possible before influenza activity increases, most flu-vaccine is administered in September through November, but vaccine is recommended to be administered throughout the influenza season as well. Because the flu vaccine usually first becomes available in September, health systems can usually meet public and patient needs for vaccination in advance of widespread influenza circulation.</p>
<p>Up to 1 in 5 people in the United States (U.S.) get influenza every season (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2015). Each year an average of approximately 226,000 people in the U.S. are hospitalized with complications from influenza and between 3,000 and 49,000 die from the disease and its complications (Thompson et al., 2003). Combined with pneumonia, influenza is the nation's 8th leading cause of death (Heron, 2015). Up to two-thirds of all deaths attributable to pneumonia and influenza occur in the population of patients that have been hospitalized during flu season regardless of age (Fedson, Houck, &amp; Bratzler, 2000). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for all persons 6 months of age and older to highlight the importance of preventing influenza. Vaccination is associated with reductions in influenza among all age groups (Kostova et al., 2013).</p>
<p>The influenza vaccination is the most effective method for preventing influenza virus infection and its potentially severe complications. Screening and vaccination of inpatients is recommended, but hospitalization is an underutilized opportunity to provide vaccination to persons 6 months of age or older.</p></div>
