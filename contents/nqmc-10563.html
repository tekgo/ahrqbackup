Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is one component of a two-part survey measure that assesses different facets of managing aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. This measure uses survey data to assess the percentage of members who are currently taking aspirin, including women 56 to 79 years of age with at least two risk factors for cardiovascular disease; men 46 to 65 years of age with at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease; and men 66 to 79 years of age, regardless of risk factors. </p>
<p>This measure is collected as part of the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Adult Version (commercial, Medicaid) using a rolling average methodology.</p>
<p>See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measure <a href="/content.aspx?id=49766" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Aspirin use and discussion: percentage of women 56 to 79 years of age and men 46 to 79 years of age who discussed the risks and benefits of using aspirin with a doctor or other health provider</a>. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends that clinicians discuss aspirin chemoprevention with adults who are at increased risk (five-year risk greater than or equal to 3 percent) for coronary heart disease (CHD). Discussions with patients should address both the potential benefits and harms of aspirin therapy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) encourages the use of aspirin therapy (75 to 162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are 40 years of age and older or who have additional risk factors (e.g., family history of cardiovascular disease [CVD], hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, albuminuria).</p>
<p>In 2004, CHD was an underlying or contributing cause of death for 451,300 people and accounted for 1 of every 5 deaths in the United States (U.S.). The prevalence of CHD for both sexes in 2005 was nearly 16 million people, or 7.3 percent of the American population (American Heart Association [AHA], 2008). The cost of cardiovascular diseases and stroke in the U.S. for 2008 was estimated at $448.5 billion (AHA, 2008), including health expenditures and lost productivity resulting from morbidity and mortality (indirect costs). Evidence shows that age is a strong demographic factor for CHD. It is projected that by 2030, 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 or older. The need for CHD management is essential (AHA, 2008; Berra, Miller, &amp; Fair, 2006).</p>
<p>Aspirin treatment has been shown to prevent one cardiovascular event over an average follow-up of 6.4 years. This means that, on average in a 6.4 year time period, the use of aspirin therapy results in a benefit of three cardiovascular events prevented per 1,000 women and four events prevented per 1,000 men (Berger et al., 2006). Aspirin has been shown to reduce CHD in patients with peripheral arterial disease, as well (Berger et al., 2006; Kikano &amp; Brown, 2007).</p>
<p>Aspirin therapy (75 to 162 mg/day) is also recommended as a secondary prevention strategy in patients who have diabetes and a history of CVD.</p>
<p>Specifications are consistent with current recommendations from USPSTF and ADA.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States (Murphy, Xu, &amp; Kochanek, 2013). Taking aspirin, when recommended by a provider, can prevent heart attack and stroke by thinning the blood to prevent blood clots from forming (American Heart Association, 2012). </li>
    <li>Cardiovascular disease cost the nation nearly $450 billion in 2010 in direct and indirect costs. Estimates suggest this number will rise to over $1 trillion by 2030 (Weintraub et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>Nearly 84 million (35.3 percent) American adults have cardiovascular disease (Go et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>On average, one death from cardiovascular disease occurs every 40 seconds (Go et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>Encouraging aspirin use can reduce heart disease and improve health outcomes in adults at risk for cardiovascular disease. Clinical guidelines recommend using aspirin to prevent and control heart disease; however, it is important for providers and patients to discuss the risks and benefits of aspirin before starting a treatment plan (US Preventive Services Task Force, 2009; 2012 Writing Committee Members et al., 2012). </li>
