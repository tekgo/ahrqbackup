<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy who had a dilated macular or fundus exam performed with documented communication to the physician who manages the ongoing care of the patient with diabetes mellitus regarding the findings of the macular or fundus exam at least once within 12 months.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The primary care physician who manages the ongoing care of the patient with diabetes should be aware of the patient's dilated eye examination and severity of retinopathy to manage the ongoing diabetes care. Such communication is important in assisting the physician to better manage the diabetes. Several studies have shown that better management of diabetes is directly related to lower rates of development of diabetic eye disease (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT], UK Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS]) ("The effect," 1993; "Tight blood pressure," 1998). </p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statement is quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represents the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>Ophthalmologists should communicate the ophthalmologic findings and level of retinopathy with the primary care physician as well as the need for optimizing metabolic control (American Academy of Ophthalmology Retina/Vitreous Panel, 2014).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>In general, communication between specialists and primary care physicians is lacking. A number of studies have assessed the adequacy of information transfer between the referring provider and the specialist and noted a significant lack of effective communication transfer (Mehrotra, Forrest, &amp; Lin, 2011). In more than half the referrals in the studies reviewed, the referring provider had no communication with the specialist (Bourguet, Gilchrist, &amp; McCord, 1998; Gandhi et al., 2000; Stille et al., 2006). Up to 45 percent of referrals resulted in no communication from the specialist back to the referring provider (Bourguet, Gilchrist &amp; McCord, 1998; Gandhi et al., 2000; Stille et al., 2006; Byrd &amp; Moskowitz, 1987; McPhee et al., 1984). A 2009 survey by O'Malley and Cunningham found that 80.6% of specialists said they "always" or "most of the time" send the referring primary care physician (PCP) notification of the results of their consultation and advice to patients, whereas only 62.2% of PCPs reported they received such information.</p>
<p>Patient surveys also identify problems with information transfer. For example, approximately one-quarter of U.S. patients reported that the results and records from one provider did not reach another provider in time for their appointment (Blendon et al., 2003; Schoen et al., 2009). Even though all physicians highly value communication between referring providers and specialists (Linzer et al., 2006) both primary care physicians and specialists cite the lack of effective information transfer as one of the greatest problems in the referral process (Gandhi et al., 2000).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on several measure testing projects in 2012, 2013 and 2015 to ensure the Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Optic Nerve Evaluation, Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Documentation of Presence or Absence of Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Communication with the Physician Managing Ongoing Diabetes Care measures are reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator and exception case identification. The testing projects were conducted utilizing electronic health record data and registry data. Parallel forms reliability and signal-to-noise reliability was tested.</p>
<p>One site participated in the parallel forms testing of the Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Communication with the Physician Managing Ongoing Diabetes Care measure. Site A was a physician-owned private practice with one ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>Signal-to-noise reliability was assessed using 2013 data acquired from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Physician Quality Reporting System Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) database.</p>
<p><strong>Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Communication with the Physician Managing Ongoing Diabetes Care</strong> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parallel Forms Reliability Testing (Site A)</span></p>
<p>There were 155 observations from one site used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide by zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used. </p>
<p>Of the 155 observations that were initially selected, 155 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.52 demonstrates moderate agreement between the automated report and reviewer. </p>
<p>Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval) <br />
Denominator: 155, 100.0%, Non-Calculable* (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)** <br />
Numerator: 155, 89.7%, 0.52 (0.32, 0.73) <br />
Exception: 155, 100.0%, Non-Calculable* (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)** </p>
<p class="Note">*Cannot calculate kappa statistics when only one response (Yes/Yes) was used, as this causes a divide-by-zero error in the statistic formula.</p>
<p class="Note">**This is an example of the limitation of the Kappa statistic. While the agreement can be 90% or greater, if one classification category dominates, the Kappa can be significantly reduced.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signal-to-Noise Reliability Testing</span><br />
For this measure, the reliability at the minimum level of quality reporting events (10) was 0.82. The average number of quality reporting events for physicians included is 80.7. The reliability at the average number of quality reporting events was 0.97. </p>
<p>This measure has high reliability when evaluated at the minimum level of quality reporting events and high reliability at the average number of quality events.</p></div>
