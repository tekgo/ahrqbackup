<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Simple ovarian cysts are a common finding in ultrasound studies. A study by Hui et al. (2014) found simple ovarian cysts in 23% of pelvic ultrasound studies. Evidence shows that approximately 70% of small simple ovarian cysts resolve spontaneously (Modesitt et al., 2003). Additionally, small simple ovarian cysts have an extremely low malignancy rate of less than 1% (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], 2007; Valentin et al., 2013). Due to low malignancy and high resolution rates, follow-up of these small cysts is not recommended (Johnson et al., 2011; Berland et al., 2014; Levine et al., 2010).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and other references</strong>:</p>
<p>In women of reproductive age:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Cysts less than or equal to 3cm: Normal physiologic findings; at the discretion of the interpreting physician whether or not to describe them in the imaging report; do not need follow up. </li>
    <li>Cysts greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 cm: Should be described in the imaging report with a statement that they are almost certainly benign; do not need follow up (Levine et al., 2010). </li>
</ol>
<p>Simple cysts and hemorrhagic cysts in women of reproductive age are almost always physiologic. Small simple cysts in postmenopausal women are common, and clinically inconsequential. Ovarian cancer, while typically cystic, does not arise from these benign-appearing cysts. After a good quality ultrasound in women of reproductive age, don't recommend follow-up for a classic corpus luteum or simple cyst less than 5 cm in greatest diameter. Use 1 cm as a threshold for simple cysts in postmenopausal women (American College of Radiology [ACR], 2012).</p>
<p>Characterization of an adnexal mass as a cyst is important for management. Ultrasound (US) identification of a simple cyst establishes a benign process in 100% of premenopausal women and in 95% to 99% of postmenopausal women. A recent consensus conference at the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in 2009 reviewed the management of asymptomatic ovarian and other adnexal cysts. Most cysts in premenopausal women are functional in nature and will resolve spontaneously. Most ACR Appropriateness Criteria&reg; 10 Clinically Suspected Adnexal Mass nonfunctional cysts in premenopausal women with classically complex, but benign, US features (such as endometriomas, simple cysts, teratomas, and hydrosalpinges) measuring less than 5 cm in diameter have been shown to remain unchanged during long-term follow-up. Therefore, it is possible to manage these lesions safely by US follow-up rather than surgical intervention in asymptomatic women (Harris et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Simple cysts up to 10 cm in diameter on ultrasound findings are almost universally benign and may safely be followed without intervention, even in postmenopausal patients (ACOG, 2007).</p>
<p>In asymptomatic women with pelvic masses, whether premenopausal or postmenopausal, transvaginal ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice. No alternative imaging modality has demonstrated sufficient superiority to transvaginal ultrasonography to justify its routine use (ACOG, 2007).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
As imaging technology continues to advance, the United States healthcare system has seen an increase in both the type and frequency of imaging studies being performed. The increase in utilization of imaging studies is accompanied by a corresponding increase in cost and exposure to radiation for both patients and healthcare professionals. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the number of radiologic procedures performed in the United States showed a ten-fold increase while the annual per-capita effective dose from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures increased by 600% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, the number of computerized tomographic (CT) examinations tripled, while the number of ultrasounds nearly doubled (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine, and ultrasound) accounted for approximately 35% of all imaging studies (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the proportion of radiation exposure that is attributable to medical sources increased from 17% to 53% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, while CT scans only accounted for approximately 17% of all radiologic procedures performed in the United States, they accounted for over 65% of the total effective radiation dose from radiologic procedures (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, the estimated per-capita effective radiation dose for radiologic procedures in the United States was nearly 20% higher than the average for other well-developed countries (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic imaging was prioritized as a topic area for measure development due to a high level of utilization, rising costs, and the need for measures to help promote appropriate use of imaging and improve outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
Since the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound published their consensus statement (Johnson et al., 2011) for the management of adnexal cysts in 2010, several studies (Harris et al., 2012; Ghosh &amp; Levine, 2013; Rosenkrantz &amp; Kierans, 2014) have been published evaluating adherence to the recommendations. Adherence to the follow-up recommendations for ovarian cysts varies widely from 59% to 95%. Evidence shows that quality improvement initiatives can be effective at improving adherence with the recommendations by up to 7% and reducing the number of pelvic sonograms performed by 27% (Harris et al., 2012; Modesitt et al., 2003). </p></div>
