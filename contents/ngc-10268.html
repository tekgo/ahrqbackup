<div class="content_para"><p>Staging is based on the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obst&eacute;trique (FIGO) classification system, which was updated in 2010. A detailed description of this staging system can be found in the Appendix in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-operative Investigations</strong></p>
<p>Investigations should include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>History and clinical exam, biopsy </li>
    <li>Chest x-ray </li>
    <li>Blood work (complete blood count [CBC], liver function tests [LFT], renal function studies) </li>
</ul>
<p>The following investigations could be considered, as clinically indicated:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Computed tomography (CT) chest/abdomen/pelvis </li>
    <li>Examination under anesthesia (EUA) cystoscopy +/- sigmoidoscopy/proctoscopy, as clinically indicated </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Primary Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients with a locally advanced primary or nodal disease should be referred for multidisciplinary clinical evaluation. </li>
    <li>An expert pathology review should be performed by a pathologist with experience in gynecologic pathology. </li>
    <li>Surgical management of the primary tumour and the lymph nodes depends on the size and location of the primary tumour (see the table below) (GOG 173 Study, unpublished results). </li>
    <li>Radical radiotherapy could be considered as an alternative to surgery in patients deemed unsuitable for surgery because of site or extent of disease, or where preservation of the clitoris or anal sphincter is desired. </li>
    <li>In patients with tumours &gt;2 cm, chemoradiotherapy could also be considered as an alternative to surgery in patients deemed unsuitable for surgery because of site or extent of disease, or where preservation of the clitoris or anal sphincter is desired. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (Patient or Population, Intervention, Comparisons, Outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What is the role of post-operative, adjuvant radiotherapy in early stage vulvar cancer? </li>
    <li>What is the role of definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in advanced stage vulvar cancer? </li>
    <li>What is the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with clinically negative nodes, with tumours &lt;2 cm? </li>

    <li>What is the most appropriate follow-up schedule for advanced stage patients treated with chemoradiotherapy only? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Entries to the Medline and EMBASE databases and clinical practice guideline databases (e.g., National Guideline Clearinghouse, CancerView, etc.) were searched for evidence relevant to this topic. Search terms included: neoplasm AND vulva or vulvar, with limits of studies in humans, clinical trials, and studies in English. Studies that did not report response rates or survival rates were further excluded.</p>
<p>The initial search in 2011 returned a total of 55 relevant studies, which included clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case studies. The search was repeated in 2013 and returned a total of three relevant citations.</p>
<p>Existing guidelines considered for this review include the following: Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada guidelines (2006), National Cancer Institute guidelines (2009), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines (2006), and the BC Cancer Agency (BCCA) guidelines (2000).</p></div>

<h3>
Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic will be assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulate the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>An effort was made to either adapt or adopt the most appropriate guidelines from other sources so that work wasn't duplicated. An evidence based perspective was used to draft proposals. Where evidence was weak, recommendations were based on group consensus.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it will be sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>

CancerControl Alberta recognizes that although industry support of research, education and other areas is necessary in order to advance patient care, such support may lead to potential conflicts of interest. Some members of the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Team are involved in research funded by industry or have other such potential conflicts of interest. However the developers of this guideline are satisfied it was developed in an unbiased manner.</p></div>
