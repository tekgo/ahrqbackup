<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>It is important to provide regular follow-up therapy to patients after they have been hospitalized for mental illness. An outpatient visit with a mental health practitioner after discharge is recommended to make sure that the patient's transition to the home or work environment is supported and that gains made during hospitalization are not lost. It also helps health care providers detect early post-hospitalization reactions or medication problems and provide continuing care. According to a guideline developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)&nbsp;and the American Psychiatric Association (APA) (1997), there is a need for regular and timely assessments and documentation of the patient's response to all treatments.</p>
<p>The specifications for this measure are consistent with guidelines of the National Institute of Mental Health and the Centers for Mental Health Services.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Approximately one in four adults in the United States (U.S.) suffers from mental illness in a given year and nearly half of U.S. adults will develop at least one mental illness in their lifetime (National Alliance on Mental Illness [NAMI], "Mental illness," 2011; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011). </li>
    <li>Mental health care costs the health care system $113 billion annually (Garfield &amp; Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2011). Mental health costs increase to $300 billion annually when they include health care and treatment services, lost earnings and wages and disability benefits (Reeves et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>About 3 percent of adults with mental illness receive treatment in inpatient settings, which constitutes the largest share of mental health spending (28 percent) (Levit et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>People with mental illness are at increased risk of suicide, which is the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S., accounting for 30,000 deaths each year (NAMI, "The impact," 2011). </li>
    <li>Mental health is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. Around 45 percent of persons with a mental health disorder suffer from two or more diagnosable disorders (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2013). </li>
    <li>Mental health is an important aspect of health and well-being. Proper follow-up care can improve health outcomes for adults and children. </li>
