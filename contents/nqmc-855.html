<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This single-item measure indicates the percentage of adult patients who reported how much they were helped ("A lot," "Somewhat," "A little," or "Not at all") by the counseling or treatment they received.</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: For consumer-level reporting, results may be reported as the percentage of the "A lot" plus "Somewhat" responses or the percentage of the "A lot" responses.  Additionally, frequency distributions encompassing all response choices (i.e., "A lot," "Somewhat," "A little," or "Not at all") are available for plans or providers to use for quality improvement purposes.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Consumer ratings and reports of their behavioral health care and the health plan or managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) that provide that care are important measures of the quality of behavioral health treatment. National efforts to develop quality indicators for behavioral health care by treatment providers, researchers and policymakers have all included consumer ratings. Moreover, many behavioral health care treatment providers use consumer ratings as a component of their quality improvement processes.</p>

<p>The Experience of Care and Health Outcomes (ECHO) Survey is designed to collect information on patients' experiences with behavioral health care. It produces data that can be useful for patients, clinicians, managed behavioral healthcare organizations (MBHO), health care plans, purchasers, States, and Federal agencies.  This ECHO Survey is part of the CAHPS family of surveys, which are developed and supported by a public-private consortium of researchers sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).</p>

<p>The ECHO Survey can be used for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>To satisfy external standards.</li>
<li>To improve the quality of mental health and substance abuse services.</li>
<li>To monitor the quality of behavioral health organizations.</li> 
<li>To hold providers accountable through public reporting.</li></ul>

Extent of Measure Testing

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The ECHO Survey 3.0 is the product of nearly six years of research and testing, as well as extensive consultations with behavioral health care experts and consumers.</p>

<p>The ECHO Development Team produced a draft instrument based on the Consumer Assessment of Behavioral Health Services (CABHS) instrument and the Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP) survey.  The draft was reviewed by multiple stakeholder groups; it was also evaluated by survey experts, administrators, mental health providers, and consumers.</p>

<p>The team conducted literacy testing of the draft instrument as well as cognitive testing with individuals who received behavioral health care services.  Recommended revisions to the survey based on this testing were reviewed with the ECHO Development Team to produce the draft of the survey that was field tested. The current version of the survey tested at a reading level between 7th and 8th grade.</p>

<p>The team then undertook a field test study to further evaluate the instrument and to refine it for use as a standardized measure of behavioral health care.</p></div>
