<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li><strong>Positive Margins</strong>
    <p>A positive margin, defined as ink on invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), is associated with at least a 2-fold increase in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). This increased risk in IBTR is not nullified by:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Delivery of a boost dose of radiation </li>
        <li>Delivery of systemic therapy (endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy), or </li>
        <li>Favorable biology </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Negative Margin Widths</strong>
    <p>Negative margins (no ink on tumor) minimize the risk of IBTR. Wider margin widths do not significantly lower this risk. The routine practice to obtain negative margin widths wider than no ink on tumor is not indicated.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Systemic Therapy</strong>
    <p>The rates of IBTR are reduced with the use of systemic therapy. In the uncommon circumstance of a patient not receiving adjuvant systemic therapy, there is no evidence suggesting that margins wider than no ink on tumor are needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Biologic Subtypes</strong>
    <p>Margins wider than no ink on tumor are not indicated based on biologic subtype.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Radiation Therapy Delivery</strong>
    <p>The choice of whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT) delivery technique, fractionation, and boost dose should not be dependent on margin width.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Invasive Lobular Carcinoma and Lobular Carcinoma in situ</strong>
    <p>Wider negative margins than no ink on tumor are not indicated for invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) at the margin is not an indication for re-excision. The significance of pleomorphic LCIS at the margin is uncertain.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Young Age</strong>
    <p>Young age (&le;40 years) is associated with both increased IBTR after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) as well as increased local relapse on the chest wall after mastectomy, and is also more frequently associated with adverse biologic and pathologic features. There is no evidence that increased margin width nullifies the increased risk of IBTR in young patients.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Extensive Intraductal Component</strong>
    <p>Extensive intraductal component (EIC) identifies patients who may have a large residual DCIS burden after lumpectomy. There is no evidence of an association between increased risk of IBTR and EIC when margins are negative.</p>
    </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Review and Meta-analysis</strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE and evidence-based medicine was conducted of articles published from 1965 to January 2013, and was combined with data from a previously published systematic review that included 21 studies from 1965 to 2010. These new analyses are referred to as the margins meta-analysis and are part of the work led by Houssami et al., (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Studies eligible for inclusion had to allow for calculation of the proportion of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in relation to margin widths and had to meet the following criteria: (1) patients had to have early-stage invasive breast cancer (BC) (stages I and II); patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or with pure ductal carcinoma in situ were not included; (2) treatment consisted of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) (all patients receiving adjuvant whole-breast radiation therapy [WBRT]); (3) microscopic margins had to be reported quantitatively with defined threshold distances/widths; (4) age data had to be present; and (5) a minimum median/mean follow-up time of 4 years was required. Details of the data collected can be found in the complete publication of the meta-analysis and are included in Supplementary Appendix A (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The systematic review methods were adapted from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations, Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and previously published methods.</p>
<p>All studies eligible for inclusion in the margins meta-analysis were reviewed and underwent data extraction by 2 independent investigators as described elsewhere. A study-level analysis was conducted, and was adjusted for study-specific median follow-up time (to account for the inherent increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence [IBTR] with longer follow-up) as well as co-variates.</p>
<p><strong>Study Quality and Limitations of the Literature</strong></p>
<p>All publications that met the inclusion criteria were retrospective in nature, with the exception of 2 studies. Therefore, the majority of studies included in the meta-analysis provided observational-level data, and the analysis was conducted at the study level because of a lack of patient-level data from the retrospective studies. The characteristics and quality assessment of the studies included in the meta-analysis are reported in Houssami et al., (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) convened a multidisciplinary expert panel (i.e., Margins Panel [MP]) in 2013 for the purpose of examining the relationship between margin width and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). The primary clinical question was: What margin width minimizes the risk of IBTR? Specific clinical circumstances that might have an impact on this question, such as tumor histology, patient age, use of systemic therapy, and technique of radiation delivery, were also examined.</p>
<p>The MP comprised a multidisciplinary group of experts designated by their respective organizations, an expert methodologist who led the evidence review, and a patient representative (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). The process for development of this guideline followed, to the extent possible, the standards of the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The panel commissioned a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature as the primary evidence base for the guideline. Additional literature reviews for specific clinical questions that could not be addressed in the meta-analysis were performed by designated panel members. The panelists met in July 2013, and all of the recommendations in this guideline were unanimously adopted.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Improved clinical decision-making for patients and physicians when defining adequate margins in the setting of breast conserving surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy </li>
    <li>The use of no ink on tumor (negative margins) as the standard for an adequate margin in invasive cancer in the era of multidisciplinary therapy is associated with low rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and has the potential to decrease re-excision rates, improve cosmetic outcomes, and decrease health care costs. </li>
