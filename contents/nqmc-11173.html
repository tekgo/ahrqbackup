Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, with a current diagnosis of melanoma or a history of melanoma whose information was entered, at least once within the 12 month period, into a recall system that includes:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A target date for the next complete physical skin exam, AND </li>
    <li>A process to follow up with patients who either did not make an appointment within the specified timeframe or who missed a scheduled appointment </li>
</ul>
<p>This measure is to be reported a minimum of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">once per reporting period</span> for patients with a current diagnosis of melanoma or a history of melanoma seen during the reporting period. It is anticipated that eligible clinicians providing care for patients with melanoma or a history of melanoma will submit this measure. </p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Lack of follow-up with providers is noted in the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on patient errors. Follow-up for skin examination and surveillance is an important aspect in the management of patients with a current diagnosis or a history of melanoma. The presence of a recall system, whether it is electronic or paper based, enables providers to ensure that patients receive follow-up appointments in accordance with their individual needs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Recommendation Statements</span></strong></p>
<p>Skin examination and surveillance at least once a year for life is recommended for all melanoma patients, including those with stage 0, in situ melanoma. Clinicians should educate all patients about post-treatment monthly self-exam of their skin and of their lymph nodes if they had stage IA to IV melanoma. Specific signs or symptoms are indications for additional radiologic imaging (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2011). </p>
<p>No clear data regarding follow-up interval exists, but at least annual history and physical examination with attention to the skin and lymph nodes is recommended (Bichakjian et al., 2011). </p>
<p>Regular clinical follow-up and interval patient self exam of skin and regional lymph nodes are the most important means of detecting recurrent disease or new primary melanoma; findings from history and physical exam should direct the need for further studies to detect local, regional, and distant metastasis (Bichakjian et al., 2011). </p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) in collaboration with the American Academy of Dermatology conducted a testing project to ensure that the melanoma measures were feasible to implement, valid and reliable. Overall, the measures were found to be valid and reliable.</p>
<p><em>Face Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Face validity of the measure score was assessed for three of the four melanoma measures. The American Academy of Dermatology Quality Metrics Committee members were asked to empirically assess face validity of these measures via online survey. The expert panel consisted of 13 members, whose specialties include oncology, melanoma, dermatology, and surgical oncology. </p>
<p>After the measure was fully specified, the expert panel was asked to rate their agreement with the following statement: "The scores obtained from the measure, as specified, will provide an accurate reflection of quality and can be used to distinguish good and poor quality."</p>

<p><em>Reliability Testing </em></p>
<p>Inter-rater reliability testing (i.e., manual review of the patient medical record by two trained clinical abstractors and comparison of their individual findings) was conducted at three dermatology practice sites on three of the four melanoma measures (i.e., measures 2, 3 and 4). These sites represent various types, locations, and sizes. Kappa statistics were calculated at the data element level for the denominator, numerator and exceptions categories. Data element reliability was established based on the results of this analysis. </p>
<p><em>Reliability Testing Results</em></p>
<p>The PCPI measure testing project revealed that the data elements for measure 2 demonstrated moderate to almost perfect reliability, the data elements for measure 3 demonstrated fair to almost perfect reliability and the data elements for measure 4 demonstrated moderate to almost perfect reliability in the numerator category. </p></div>
