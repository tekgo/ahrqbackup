Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of women 50 to 74 years of age who had a mammogram to screen for breast cancer. </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Electronic and Hybrid Specifications.

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer among American women, with approximately 178,000 new cases reported each year (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2007). It is most common in women over 50. Women whose breast cancer is detected early have more treatment choices and better chances for survival. Mammography screening has been shown to reduce mortality by 20 to 30 percent among women 40 and older. A mammogram can reveal tumors too small to be felt by hand; it can also show other changes in the breast that may suggest cancer</p>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Preventive Medicine recommend mammograms as the most effective method for detecting breast cancer when it is most treatable (USPSTF, 2002; "AAFP periodic," 2005; Ferrini et al., 1996). When high-quality equipment is used and well-trained radiologists read the x-rays, 85 to 90 percent of cancers are detectable.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>All HEDIS measures undergo systematic assessment of face validity with review by measurement advisory panels, expert panels, a formal public comment process and approval by the National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) Committee on Performance Measurement and Board of Directors. Once NCQA establishes national benchmarks for accountable care organization (ACO) performance, all measures will undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomiol statistical analysis. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test.</p></div>
