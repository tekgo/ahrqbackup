<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is intended to promote adult tobacco screening and tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. There is good evidence that tobacco screening and brief cessation intervention (including counseling and/or pharmacotherapy) is successful in helping tobacco users quit. Tobacco users who are able to stop smoking lower their risk for heart disease, lung disease, and stroke. </p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines</strong>:</p>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2015) recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&ndash;approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to adults who use tobacco.</p>
<p>The USPSTF (2015) recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant women about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant women who use tobacco.</p>
<p>The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to recommend electronic nicotine delivery systems for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant women. The USPSTF (2015) recommends that clinicians direct patients who smoke tobacco to other cessation interventions with established effectiveness and safety (previously stated). </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong></p>
<p><em>Incidence, Prevalence, &amp; Cost</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In 2006, approximately 20.8% (45.3 million) U.S. adults were current smokers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2007). There has not been a significant change in this prevalence since 2004 (CDC, "Cigarette smoking," 2005). </li>
    <li>During 1997 to 2001, approximately 438,000 premature deaths each year are attributed to smoking or exposure to second hand smoke (CDC, "Annual," 2005). </li>
    <li>The 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) found that approximately 72.9 million (29.6%) Americans age 12 years and older were current users of tobacco (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2007). A breakdown by type of tobacco is as follows:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>61.6 million persons (25.0%) were current cigarette smokers </li>
        <li>13.7 million persons (5.6%) smoked cigars </li>
        <li>8.2 million persons (3.3%) use smokeless tobacco </li>
        <li>2.3 million (0.9%) smoked tobacco in a pipe </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Smoking attributable health care expenditures in 1998 were estimated to be $75.5 billion (CDC, 2004). This, plus the estimated productivity losses of $92 billion from 1997 to 2001 combine for a total of over $167 billion per year. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Opportunity for Improvement/Gap or Variation in Care</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It has been reported that overall, adults receive approximately half of all recommended medical care (McGlynn et al., 2003; Asch et al., 2006). </li>
    <li>From 1998 to 2000 ("Technical appendix," 2006):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>43% of patients had smoking status documented at least once </li>
        <li>61% of patients that were documented smokers had their smoking status indicated on more than 50% of office visits </li>
        <li>12% of patients identified as smokers had documentation that advice to quit smoking was given at least once during the year </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a testing project in 2011 to ensure the <em>Tobacco Use: Screening and Cessation Intervention</em> measure was reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator and exceptions case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing electronic health record data. Signal-to-noise reliability was tested. Multiple sites participated in the parallel forms testing of the measure and comprised of a network of community health centers across the United States. Members in the network largely consisted of safety net organizations serving primarily low income and uninsured patients. </p>
<p><strong>Measures Tested</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Tobacco Use: Screening and Cessation Intervention </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from electronic health records were used to perform signal-to-noise reliability for the measures. </p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing Results</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signal-to-Noise Reliability Testing</span></p>
<p>Electronic Health Record</p>
<p>For this measure, the reliability at the minimum level of quality reporting events (10) was 0.46. The average number of quality reporting events for physicians included is 76.1. The reliability at the average number of quality reporting events was 0.86.</p>
<p>This measure has stable reliability when evaluated at the minimum level of quality reporting events and high reliability at the average number of quality events.</p></div>
