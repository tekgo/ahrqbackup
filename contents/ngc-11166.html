Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based</strong>, <strong>Formal consensus</strong>, <strong>Informal consensus</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>For patients who were diagnosed with a small renal mass (SRM), when is renal tumor biopsy (RTB) indicated? What is the contemporary accuracy and complication profile of RTB?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.0</em>: On the basis of tumor-specific findings and competing risks of mortality, all patients with an SRM should be considered for RTB when the results may alter management (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In patients with an SRM, is there an age limit at which active surveillance is a better option than surgical resection or thermal ablation? Is there an anticipated life expectancy for which active surveillance is a better option than surgical intervention or thermal ablation? Are patients with significant and active medical comorbidities&mdash;that is, chronic kidney disease (CKD), congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&mdash;better treated with active surveillance than surgical intervention or ablation?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.0</em>: Active surveillance should be an initial management option for patients who have significant comorbidities and limited life expectancy (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p>Qualifying statement: absolute indication: high risk for anesthesia and intervention or life expectancy &lt;5 years; relative indication: significant risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if treated, SRM (&lt;1 cm), or life expectancy &lt;10 years.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In patients with an SRM, what are the optimal indications for undergoing partial nephrectomy (PN), radical nephrectomy, or thermal ablation? What is the impact of these procedures on renal function?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em>: PN for SRMs is the standard treatment that should be offered to all patients in whom an intervention is indicated and who possess a tumor that is amenable to this approach (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em>: Percutaneous thermal ablation should be considered an option for patients that possess tumors such that complete ablation will be achieved. A biopsy should be obtained before or at the time of ablation (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3</em>: Radical nephrectomy for SRMs should only be reserved for patients who possess a tumor of significant complexity that is not amenable to PN or for whom PN may result in unacceptable morbidity even when performed at centers with expertise. Referral to a surgeon and a center with experience in PN should be considered (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.4</em>: Referral to a nephrologist should be considered for patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m&sup2;) or progressive CKD after treatment, especially if associated with proteinuria (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Expert Panel developed the recommendations by using evidence that was identified through online searches of Medline (PubMed) and the Cochrane Collaboration Library electronic databases (&plusmn; meeting abstracts) from January 2000 through September 2015. This search was complemented by panel members' additional suggestions of articles that were missing from the original searches. Data Supplement 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) includes full details on the search string. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence on the basis of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Population: Patients with clinically localized small renal mass (SRM). </li>
    <li>Publications that reported rigorously conducted systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses), randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and prospective or retrospective observational studies. </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were meeting abstracts that were not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; or published in a non-English language. Further details on the systematic review can be found in the Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<h3>
Number of Source Documents
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A total of 83 studies met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the guideline recommendations. Identified trials included 20 systematic reviews&mdash;17 on different SRM treatment modalities and three on RTB&mdash;and 63 primary studies. Seven of the primary studies were retrospective studies on the treatment of elderly patients with SRMs. There were six retrospective studies on surveillance; nine retrospective studies on renal tumor biopsy; and three RCTS, two prospective comparative trials, and 27 retrospective studies on different surgical interventions for SRMs. In addition, nine retrospective studies evaluated the impact of these interventions on renal function.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expert Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, nephrology, nuclear and radiation oncology, surgical oncology, pathology, community oncology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>An Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation met via teleconference and/or webinar and corresponded through e-mail. On the basis of the consideration of the evidence, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize guideline recommendations. Members of the Expert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penultimate version of the guideline.</p>
<p>Guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, by using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software&trade;. This method helps Guideline Expert Panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Expert Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p>
<p>In addition, a guideline implementability review was conducted. On the basis of the implementability review, revisions were made to the draft to clarify recommended actions for clinical practice. Ratings for the type and strength of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias are provided with each recommendation.</p>
<p>In some selected cases in which evidence is lacking but there was a high level of agreement among Expert Panel members, informal consensus is used (as noted in the "Major Recommendations" field).</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A recent systematic review showed a low rate of Clavien &le;2 complications was reported after renal tumor biopsy (RTB). </li>
    <li>Partial nephrectomy (PN) is associated with a higher complication rate than radical nephrectomy. </li>
    <li>PN is associated with an excellent cancer-specific survival rate, but carries a certain potential for treatment-related complications, which is greatest among the surgical treatment options for small renal masses (SRMs). </li>
    <li>In addition to medical comorbidities, renal mass location and size seem to be associated with complication rates after ablation. The benefits and risks of ablation should be carefully weighed for centrally located masses or those in close proximity to structures such as ureters, ureteropelvic junction, small or large bowel, or nerves. </li>
    <li>Perioperative outcomes, such as length of hospital stay, estimated blood loss, and open surgical conversion, favor thermal ablation relative to surgical options. Meta-analysis of percutaneous and surgical (open or laparoscopic) ablation strategies reveals a lower major complication rate for percutaneous ablation. </li>
    <li>The most significant drawback of radical nephrectomy is the detrimental impact on kidney function and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) after treatment. </li>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, as well as to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
<p>For additional information on the ASCO implementation strategy, please see the <a href="https://www.asco.org/practice-guidelines/quality-guidelines/implementation-strategy" title="ASCO Web site">ASCO Web site</a>.</p></div>
