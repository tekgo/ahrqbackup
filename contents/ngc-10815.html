Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Panel suggests that the use of a combination of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) plus memantine rather than ChEI alone may provide useful benefits in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite statistically significant differences, the observed treatment effects remain modest in terms of clinical management of individual patients. The strength of the evidence for use of the combination for moderate to severe AD varied between the four domains. It was strong for patients with behavioural symptoms. The overall strength of recommendation was weak.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The time period covered by the literature research was from 01/2004 to 01/2013.</p>
<p>Trials were identified from a search of ALOIS, the specialized register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, using the search terms "Alzheimer's disease", "donepezil", "E2020", "Aricept", "galanthamin", "galantamine", "reminyl", "rivastigmine", "exelon", "ENA 713" and "ENA-713", "memantine", "combination therapy" and "dual therapy". This register consists of records from major healthcare databases including MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and Lilacs (Bireme). It also searches major trial and pharmaceutical industry trials registers. ALOIS covers all randomized controlled trials of interventions for people with dementia, for people with cognitive impairment and for the improvement of, or prevention of decline in, cognitive function in healthy people. It was created in 2008 and represents a free open-access resource. The panellists found 11 publications related to the patients, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) question.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trial Inclusion</span></strong></p>
<p>Other than in the study by Schneider et al. which included patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), the panellists considered only trials if they included moderate to severe AD patients, assessed at least one of the outcomes defined in the PICO question and followed a randomized double-blind, parallel group design. Seven studies fulfilled these criteria. To avoid duplications they excluded those studies which represented <em>post hoc</em> analysis of the original MEM-MD-02 trial, leaving four trials to be included in the analysis.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>The clinical and demographic characteristics and data on outcomes under investigation were extracted from primary reports. All data were independently extracted by two panellists and discrepancies were resolved by discussion.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of the Risk of Study Bias</span></strong></p>
<p>Based on the description of methodology all included studies were evaluated for random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias) and other bias that might have been detected during the review process.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>The Panel performed a meta-analysis to estimate the difference between the group with cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) and memantine treatment and the group with ChEI monotherapy. The data of each clinical domain (activities of daily living [ADL], behaviour, cognitive functioning, global clinical impression [GCI]), as well as serious adverse events, were pooled separately. In order to be able to pool data from different rating scales within a domain, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was chosen as the effect size. The risk difference was calculated for serious adverse events. A random effects meta-analysis with an inverse-variance weighting approach was conducted using the RevMan 5.2 software and yielded a combined SMD/risk difference with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and several measures of heterogeneity (e.g., <em>I</em><sup>2</sup> index). A Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence profile was created using the GRADEpro software for each clinical domain and serious adverse events.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GRADE Evidence Profile</strong></span></p>
<p>Figure 6 in the original guideline document provides the GRADE evidence profile. Based on the study design and the results of the meta-analysis this evidence profile classifies the quality of evidence in one of four levels ranging from very low to high for the overall underlying literature for each important outcome.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>Guideline development followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group in line with the 2012 recommendations for preparation of neurological management guidelines by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) scientific task forces (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The GRADE approach is based on a sequential assessment of the quality of evidence, followed by assessment of the balance between advantages and disadvantages, and finally judgement about the strength of recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Clinical Question</span></strong></p>
<p>As in any well-conducted research study, the GRADE guideline development addresses well-designed clinical questions. Each clinical question contains the four components known by the acronym "PICO": patients; intervention; comparison; and the outcome(s) of interest, both beneficial and harmful. The PICO question was whether a combination of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) plus memantine rather than ChEI alone should be used in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) in general and specifically to improve (i) global clinical impression (GCI), (ii) cognitive functioning, (iii) behaviour and (iv) activities of daily living (ADL). In line with the GRADE recommendations, when several outcomes are possible for each clinical question the GRADE approach asks panellists to make explicit judgements about the importance of each outcome for making a recommendation. Each panellist was asked to make an explicit judgement in writing using a nine-point scale with scores in the range 7&ndash;9 identifying outcomes of critical importance for decision making. Ratings between 4 and 6 characterized important but not critical outcomes and those in the range between 1 and 3 were outcomes of limited importance. The rating of the importance of the different outcomes took place prior to systematic statistical outcome evaluation. Overall, all outcomes were considered to be of critical importance with the mean of the ratings being 7.9 for ADL, 7.6 for behaviour, 7.3 for cognitive functioning, 6.3 for GCI. The importance of serious adverse events was also rated and obtained a mean score of 6.5.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Determination of the Direction and Strength of Recommendation and Consensus Finding</span></strong></p>
<p>Determination of direction and strengths of recommendations was based on the balance between desirable and undesirable eﬀects of combined ChEI and memantine treatment versus ChEI treatment alone, the quality of evidence, values and preferences and costs. For details refer to the EFNS guidance for preparation of neurological management guidelines. Direction was a recommendation "for" or "against" combined ChEI and memantine treatment, and the strength of recommendation had only two levels: "strong" or "weak". Recommendations were given for each outcome. Consensus was reached by use of the Delphi method during which panellists answered a questionnaire, working independently without meeting in person. After each round, a panellist served as a facilitator and provided an anonymous summary of the panellists' opinions from the previous round, and participants were encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies from other members of the group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Direction and Strength of Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>Agreement of panellists was reached after the second round of the consensus finding procedure. All panellists agreed already in the first round that, compared to ChEI monotherapy, the desirable effects of combined ChEI and memantine treatment outweigh undesirable effects in patients with moderate to severe AD. With one exception there existed also agreement in the first round that the general recommendation in favour of combination therapy is weak. All panellists gave a weak recommendation for ADL, a strong recommendation for behaviour with two exceptions and a weak recommendation for cognition and GCI with three exceptions. In the second round all panellists agreed on recommendations in favour of combined ChEI plus memantine treatments as summarized in Table 2 in the original guideline document.</p></div>

Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations

<div class="content_para"><p>Guideline development followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. Direction was a recommendation "for" or "against" combined cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) and memantine treatment, and the strength of recommendation had only two levels: "strong" or "weak."</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>It is well established that behavioural symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with higher care costs than in AD patients with no or little behavioural change. A 1-point increase on the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), which is a tool to assess dementia-related behavioural symptoms with a maximum score of 144, increases the annual care costs by US $247&ndash;409. Therefore the approximately 3 point diﬀerence on NPI between cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) monotherapy and combination therapy translates into substantial cost savings.</p></div>
