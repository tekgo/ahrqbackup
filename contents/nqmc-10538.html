Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 18 to 64 years of age with schizophrenia and diabetes who had both a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) test and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test during the measurement year.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Prevalence rates of metabolic syndrome in people with schizophrenia is 42.6 percent for males and 48.5 percent for females, compared with rates in the general population (24 percent for males, 23 percent for females) (Cohn et al., 2004).</p>
<p>Among patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and metabolic disorders, the non-treatment rate for diabetes is approximately 32 percent (Nasrallah et al., 2006). In addition to general diabetes risk factors, diabetes is promoted in patients with schizophrenia by initial and current treatment with olanzapine and mid-potency first-generation antipsychotics (FGA), as well as by current treatment with low-potency FGAs and clozapine (Nielsen, Skadhede, &amp; Correll, 2010).</p>
<p>Improving blood sugar control has shown to lead to lower use of health care services and better overall satisfaction with diabetes treatment (Asche, LaFleur, &amp; Conner, 2011). People who control their diabetes also report improved quality of life and emotional well-being (Saatci et al., 2010). </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In 2010, heart disease and diabetes were the leading causes of death in the United States (U.S.) (Murphy, Xu, &amp; Kochanek, 2013). Because persons with serious mental illness who use antipsychotics are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, screening and monitoring of these conditions is important. </li>
    <li>In 2007, diabetes was estimated to cost the U.S. economy $174 billion. Of this, $116 billion was attributed to medical care and $58 billion to disability, work loss and premature death (Roger et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>People with diabetes and schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have a 50 percent higher risk of death than diabetics without a mental illness (Vinogradova et al., 2010). </li>
    <li>Lack of appropriate care for diabetes and cardiovascular disease for people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who use antipsychotic medications can lead to worsening health and death. Addressing these physical health needs is an important way to improve health and economic outcomes downstream. </li>
