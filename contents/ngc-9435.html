Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (Class <strong>I</strong>-<strong>IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>For patients with suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3 assays are probably moderately accurate in diagnosing CJD: sensitivity ~92%, specificity ~80% (multiple consistent Class II studies). Whereas a negative 14-3-3 assay may be helpful in reducing the suspicion of sCJD, a positive CSF 14-3-3 assay may be found in a potentially treatable case of dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>For patients who have rapidly progressive dementia and are strongly suspected of having CJD, and for whom diagnosis remains uncertain (pretest probability ~20%&ndash;90%), clinicians should order CSF 14-3-3 assays to reduce the uncertainty of the diagnosis (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Diagnostic Accuracy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study where a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data was collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt; 5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2012 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched using the terms 14-3-3 protein, CSF analysis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, prion disease, dementia, and rapidly progressive dementia (exploded terms where appropriate). The exact keyword search is available in appendix e-1 of the Data Supplement document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). In addition, the reference lists of the articles identified were hand searched to identify articles that may have been missed in the initial search. Duplicates, reviews without original data, meeting abstracts, and case reports/series were excluded. The search included English-language articles and covered publications ranging from 1995 to January 1, 2011.</p>
<p>Studies in human subjects above 18 years of age were included. Non-sporadic cases from growth hormone use, genetic, iatrogenic (postsurgical), and new-variant (mad cow disease) prion diseases were excluded. Also excluded were non-Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) prion disorders and animal studies. In studies that looked at a mix of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and other CJD subtypes, only the data on patients with sCJD were extracted for the analysis.</p>
<p>The search strategy identified 11,165 articles (3,488 from Medline, 5,254 from EMBASE, 59 from Cochrane Library, 2,364 from PubMed). After the primary screening in which the titles and abstracts were reviewed, 80 studies were deemed potentially relevant, and their full text was reviewed in the secondary screening process. Thirty-eight articles met inclusion criteria.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>MEDLINE was searched from January 2011 to July 2015 using the search terms 14-3-3 protein, CSF analysis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, prion disease, dementia, and rapidly progressive dementia. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the search included humans only, relevant to clinical questions; criteria used to screen search results were the same as described in the 2012 published guideline.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The articles were rated for their risk of bias according to the American Academy of Neurology classification of evidence criteria for diagnostic testing (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field), and recommendations were linked to the level of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). In accordance with these criteria, studies with incorporation bias (the results of the 14-3-3 protein assay influenced the determination of the presence of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [sCJD]) are rated Class IV, and studies with spectrum bias (which excluded a priori patients with uncertain diagnoses of sCJD) are rated Class III.</p>
<p>The number of patients, study design, data collection methods, patient population, diagnostic reference standard, and type of 14-3-3 assay used were collected. Other data extracted included the raw numbers of patients who tested positive vs. negative for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3 and their clinical or pathologic diagnosis, or both.</p>
<p>Of the 38 articles included in the study, 9 were deemed Class II; no Class I studies were identified. The majority of the Class II studies were cohort studies with mixed retrospective and prospective data collection (table 1of the original guideline document). Fifteen studies were rated Class III, and another 14 were rated Class IV (table e-3 of the original guideline document). Downgrading was done if the cohort was incomplete. Spectrum bias in patients or controls was also a concern in a number of studies. All Class II studies enrolled patients with rapidly progressive dementia suspected of having Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).</p></div>

<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) member who had expertise in neurologic disease conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists.</p></div>
