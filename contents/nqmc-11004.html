<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure addresses dyspnea for patients with high severity of illness and risk of death, including seriously and incurably ill patients enrolled in hospice or hospital-based palliative care. Research on care of patients nearing the end of life shows they experience high rates of physical, emotional, and spiritual causes of distress ("A controlled trial," 1995; Gade et al., 2008). The National Priorities Partnership has identified palliative and end-of-life care as one of its national priorities. A goal of this priority is to ensure that all patients with life-limiting illness have access to effective treatment for symptoms such as pain and shortness of breath. In 2009, 1.56 million people with life-limiting illness received hospice care ("NHPCO facts and figures," 2010). In 2008, 58.5% of United States (U.S.) hospitals with 50 or more beds had some form of palliative care service, and national trends show a steady expansion of these services ("Palliative care programs," 2010).</p>
<p>Dyspnea is a common symptom in serious illness, more common than pain for patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, and restrictive lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis (Luce &amp; Luce, 2001). Unlike pain, dyspnea severity is associated with the risk of death (Olajide et al., 2007). Between 50% and 70% of patients with advanced lung cancer experience dyspnea near the end of life. As detailed in a recent systematic review, opioids, oxygen and non-pharmacologic nursing interventions demonstrate efficacy in randomized controlled trials of treatment for dyspnea in cancer and in other serious illness (Ben-Aharon, et al., 2008; Lorenz et al., 2008). Unfortunately, dyspnea is often persistent and under-treated in advanced cancer and other end-stage diseases (Roberts, Thorne, &amp; Pearson, 1993).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Dyspnea is prevalent and undertreated for many populations of seriously ill patients, including those patients nearing the end of life. Screening for dyspnea is necessary to determine its presence and severity, and forms the basis for treatment decision-making. Unlike pain, structured clinical assessment of the symptom is less well-defined, yet similar to pain, effective treatment is available to alleviate symptom distress.</p>
<p>Prevalence of dyspnea in advanced cancer ranges from 50% to 70%. Among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with advanced illness enrolled in the SUPPORT Study, dyspnea which was moderate to severe at least half of the time was present for at least 65% of patients throughout the 6 months preceding death. </p>
<p>Effective treatment for dyspnea is available, but not consistently administered. Evidence-based treatments include pharmacologic interventions such as opioids and inhaled bronchodilators, and non-pharmacologic interventions including oxygen for hypoxic patients, pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise in COPD, and drainage of pleural effusion.</p>
<p>Limited research has explored the nature of health disparities in the experience of dyspnea or in dyspnea management. One observational study of dyspnea in cancer patients provides evidence that dyspnea and other symptoms, in addition to minority race/ethnicity, independently predict worsened survival.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Two research nurse abstractors independently recorded quality measures data on a random subset of 20 seriously ill patients. Abstractors used the pre-defined operational definitions and a structured chart abstraction tool to record numerator and denominator data separately. Patients were a subsample of 460 seriously ill patients without specialty palliative care admitted to an acute care hospital for at least 1 day to four inpatient services from February 2008 to November 2009. Records eligible for sampling included all seriously ill adult patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care, medically complex patients aged 65 and older admitted to an acute care of the elderly unit, and medical oncology patients with Stage IV carcinoma. </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Inter-rater reliability between the two abstractors was assessed using kappa statistics. </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. The nurse abstractors achieved excellent inter-rater reliability for this measure: Kappa=0.89. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Hospice: The total patient sample size was 126. Fourteen hospices, located in seven different states, representing both free-standing and hospital based providers were recruited to participate. Each hospice was asked to contribute data from nine patient records to the study. Nine hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine discharges; five hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine admissions. </p>
<p>Palliative Care: The total patient sample size was 562. Chart abstractions were completed for 102 consecutive seriously ill patients with specialty palliative care consultation, and a random sample of 460 seriously ill patients without specialty palliative care admitted to an acute care hospital for at least 1 day to four inpatient services with high proportions of seriously ill patients. Records eligible for sampling included all patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care, medically complex patients aged 65 and older admitted to a geriatric evaluation unit, and medical oncology patients with Stage IV carcinoma. Because palliative care domains become even more relevant closer to death, patients dying in hospital were oversampled to ensure a final ratio of 1 decedent to 1 live discharge. Consistent with oversampling of decedent records, 55% of these patients died in hospital. The age of the patients ranged from 16 to 99 years, with the mean age 61. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (65%), with smaller subgroups who were African American (24%) and Hispanic/Latino (4%). The most common life-limiting diagnoses were infections (37%), cancer (34%), pulmonary (29%), and neurologic diseases (21%). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Hospice sample: Face validity was tested using formal expert panel review. The PEACE project team convened a 14-member technical expert panel (TEP) of nationally recognized experts with extensive experience in the following areas: medical or nursing expertise in hospice and palliative care, methods and instrumentation, and quality improvement. Using criteria provided by the Carolinas Center for Medical Excellence (CCME) study team, TEP members rated each potential quality measure from 1 (low) to 5 (high) on four criteria: importance, scientific soundness, feasibility and usability. The rating criteria mirrored those used by the National Quality Forum and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Measures Management System. To identify the measures with the most favorable ratings, a summary measure was created. For each quality measure, the average TEP rating for each criterion was calculated and then an overall average measure rating (AMR) was tabulated, weighting each the criteria equally. </p>
<p>Palliative Care sample: Face validity of PEACE quality measures for hospital-based specialty palliative care was addressed using stakeholder review and feedback. Investigators prepared data reports in a summary format with detailed operational definitions, and led a 1-hour discussion with nursing and physician leaders from each service group &ndash; medical intensive care unit (MICU), surgical intensive care unit (SICU), acute care for the elderly (geriatrics), oncology, and palliative care. The discussion included feedback of quality measure data, response to questions and critiques, and eliciting stakeholder feedback about the validity and actionability of this data for the care of their patients. Stakeholders were specifically asked to comment on the accuracy of the data as a reflection of current care practices, and their highest priority area for future quality improvement. </p>
<p>Construct validity was tested by comparing the PEACE quality measures for patients seen by specialty interdisciplinary palliative care consultants to those not receiving specialty palliative care services.</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. Hospice sample: Completed ratings were received from 13 of the 14 TEP members. The 75th percentile cut-point translated into an AMR=3.73 (on a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 is highest). This process resulted in the identification of 23 measures with the highest TEP ratings for importance, scientific soundness, feasibility and usability. Dyspnea treatment had an overall rating of greater than 4 ("high importance") while screening for dyspnea was added as an antecedent measure. Pilot testing in the hospice sample revealed that only 78% of 126 hospice patients were screened for dyspnea, and only 45% of those who screened positive were given treatment within 24 hours. </p>
<p>Palliative Care sample: Face Validity: Stakeholder discussions provided broad endorsement of face validity, with some considerations for specific patient populations. Medical oncologists endorsed the face validity of these quality measures, but favored quality measures endorsed by oncology professional organizations. </p>
<p>Construct Validity: Screening for dyspnea was nearly universal for all seriously ill patients, but was more consistently done by specialty palliative care providers (100% vs 95%, p=0.016). Patients with dyspnea were likely to receive some form of treatment within 24 hours, with or without the addition of specialty palliative care (96% vs 93%, p=NS). </p>
<p><strong>Identification of Meaningful Differences in Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Hospice: The total patient sample size was 126. Fourteen hospices, located in seven different states, representing both free-standing and hospital based providers, were recruited to participate. Each hospice was asked to contribute data from nine patient records to the study. Nine hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine discharges; five hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine admissions. </p>
<p>A common structured data collection tool was developed for use by all hospices, regardless of whether the patient record was an admission or discharge record. Instructions embedded in the tool indicated the data items appropriate to each type of record. Hospices were instructed not to institute new data collection procedures for the data collection pilot. If a data item could not be found, they were told to mark the item as "unable to determine." </p>
<p>A data dictionary containing item-specific instructions and notes related to the patient data collection tool was distributed to each hospice center. Technical assistance was provided by email and phone to staff during the data collection period. Questions, and responses, that arose during data collection were immediately distributed to all hospices participating in the data pilot.</p>
<p>Palliative Care: The total patient sample size was 562. Chart abstractions were completed for 102 consecutive seriously ill patients with specialty palliative care consultation, and a random sample of 460 seriously ill patients without specialty palliative care admitted to an acute care hospital for at least 1 day to four inpatient services with high proportions of seriously ill patients from February 2008 to November 2009. Records eligible for sampling included all patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care, medically complex patients aged 65 and older admitted to a geriatric evaluation unit, and medical oncology patients with Stage IV carcinoma. Because palliative care domains become even more relevant closer to death, patients dying in hospital were oversampled to ensure a final ratio of 1 decedent to 1 live discharge. Consistent with oversampling of decedent records, 55% of these patients died in hospital. The age of the patients ranged from 16 to 99 years, with the mean age 61. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (65%), with smaller subgroups who were African American (24%) and Hispanic/Latino (4%). The most common life-limiting diagnoses were infections (37%), cancer (34%), pulmonary (29%), and neurologic diseases (21%). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Construct validity was tested by comparing the PEACE quality measures for patients seen by specialty interdisciplinary palliative care consultants to those not receiving specialty palliative care services. Percentage of patients with and without specialty palliative care for whom the quality measure was met was compared for difference using the chi-square statistic. </p>
<p><em>Results</em>. Hospice sample: 45% met the quality measure <br />
Seriously ill patients with palliative care sample: 96% met quality measure <br />
Seriously ill patients without palliative care: 93% (p=NS)</p></div>
