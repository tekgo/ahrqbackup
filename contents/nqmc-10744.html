<h2>Brief Abstract

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of individuals 18 years of age and older who reported on the baseline health appraisal (HA) that they had at least one of the three core risks (i.e., obesity, smoking or tobacco use, physical inactivity) and who reported on a follow-up HA that they reduced their overall risk. </p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>One of the goals of worksite health promotion interventions is to reduce the health risks of employees, in order to improve the health of employees, increase productivity, and reduce health care costs (Employee Benefits Research Institute [EBRI], 2001). Identifying and calculating risk reduction with standardized health appraisal information will allow organizations to understand the impact of health promotion interventions, and will allow for comparisons across organizations offering health promotion interventions.</p>
<p>This measure offers standardized definitions of risk reduction for three "core" risks often addressed by health promotion programs: overweight and obesity, cigarette smoking and tobacco use, and physical inactivity. These three risks were chosen because they: 1) represent significant public health problems; 2) can be assessed using valid and reliable self-report questions; and 3) are important to employers and plan sponsors of health promotion programs.</p>
<p>Reducing overweight and obesity, cigarette smoking and tobacco use, and physical inactivity have all been identified as health priorities by Healthy People 2020 (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], 2016). The validity and reliability of certain self-reported items for these risks have also been supported by the literature (Gorber et al., 2007; Patrick et al., 1994; Norman et al., 2001). These three risks are also important to employers, according to research published by the EBRI (2001). Lastly, worksite interventions can lower these risks (The Guide to Community Preventive Services, 2007; The Guide to Community Preventive Services, 2005).</p></div>
