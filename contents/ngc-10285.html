<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by Warwick Evidence, Warwick Medical School and McMDC Ltd. Health &amp; Economics (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). See Sections 6 and 10.2 of the manufacturer's submission (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for details on identification and selection of studies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Submitted Clinical Effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The evidence on clinical effectiveness comes from two trials, COPERNICUS and GALILEO. Patients in the trials were adults (aged &ge;18 years) with visual impairment due to macular oedema (MO) caused by central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) diagnosed not more than 9 months before study initiation. Mean central retinal thickness (CRT) in all study eyes was &ge;250 um using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and patients had an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 73 to 24 letters (20/40 to 20/320) in the study eye. In both trials, aflibercept (2 mg intravitreal injection) was compared against sham injection.</p>
<p><strong>ERG's Comments on Clinical Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>The Evidence Review Group (ERG) regard the aflibercept trials of being of good quality, and providing good evidence that aflibercept is effective in improving vision after CRVO, with an acceptable safety record. One weakness is that patients were not asked, at the end of the trials, whether they thought they had been allocated to aflibercept or sham.</p>
<p>The ERG had access to a network meta-analysis (NMA) undertaken by an academic group. The results reported in the Bayer submission and those reported by the academic group were similar.</p>
<p>The ERG also had access to an independent systematic review (submitted for publication) of treatment of MO after CRVO and this confirmed that the Bayer submission included all relevant published trials of aflibercept, ranibizumab and dexamethasone.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>ERG Comment on Manufacturer's Review of Cost-effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Bayer has appropriately provided adequate description of their cost-effectiveness systematic review including search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria and description of included and excluded studies.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by Warwick Evidence, Warwick Medical School and McMDC Ltd. Health &amp; Economics (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary and Critique of Submitted Clinical Effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p><em>Quality of Included Randomised Controlled Trials</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer presented quality assessment results in their submission. The ERG has used the Cochrane risk of bias score and considers both trials to be of good quality. The ERG wondered if at the end of the trials, patients were asked what treatment they thought they had been allocated to. Were they able to distinguish between an injection into the eye, and the sham of pressure without puncture? Asking them would have provided a useful check on the security of masking. The manufacturer reported during clarification that patients were not asked.</p>
<p>Three groups were defined for analysis. For analysis of primary efficacy data, the full analysis set (FAS) was used. FAS was defined as all randomised patients who received any study medication and had a baseline assessment and at least one efficacy assessment after baseline (analysed as randomised). For safety, a safety population (SAF) was used, defined as all randomised patients who received any study medication (analysed as treated). Lastly, a sensitivity analysis was carried out using a per protocol (PP) population which included all patients in the FAS who received at least five injections of study medication and did not have any major protocol violations or deviations (analysed as treated).</p>
<p>The analysis did not include an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Instead, a FAS was reported. The FAS included all randomised patients who received any study drug and had a baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment, and the difference in numbers between true ITT and FAS were trivial &ndash; COPERNICUS ITT 115 aflibercept and 74 sham; FAS 114 and 73. GALILEO ITT 106 and 72; FAS 103 and 68. The ERG regards the FAS as suitable for analysis.</p>
<p>Refer to section 3 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for a summary and ERG critique of the two trials.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect Comparison</strong></p>
<p>In the absence of a head to head comparison of aflibercept against ranibizumab in central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), the manufacturer undertook a network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the effects of the two treatments on visual acuity (VA). The manufacturer carried out a systematic search to find relevant clinical data on ranibizumab given in an as needed (PRN) or 'reactive dosing' regimen. Eight studies were identified on the efficacy and safety of aflibercept, ranibizumab, dexamethasone and bevacizumab. Two studies (CRUISE and ROCC) investigated ranibizumab, two studies (COPERNICUS and GALILEO) aflibercept, two studies dexamethasone (GENEVA 008 and GENEVA 009) and two studies investigated bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was not included in the NMA.</p>
<p>The manufacturer states that because of the cross over design of the COPERNICUS, CRUISE and GENEVA trials at 6 months (24 weeks), the NMA was conducted on 6-month trial data only. Thus, five studies reporting the 6-month results of the trials of interest were included in the NMA.</p>
<p><em>Critical Assessment of the Manufacturer's NMA</em></p>
<p>The ERG critically appraised the manufacturer's indirect comparisons using a checklist suggested by Donegan and colleagues.</p>
<p>The ERG found that the methods used by the manufacturer to undertake NMA were appropriate. Adequate description of the trials were given. Baseline characteristics of all the studies were presented and the manufacturer gave appropriate reasons for including these studies. The manufacturer has correctly used the Bayesian approach using WinBUGS to analyse the data. Heterogeneity was also tested appropriately. The findings were also presented correctly.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer developed a <em>de novo</em> cost utility model with a four week cycle length and a lifetime horizon. Health states are defined in terms of 15 ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) letter wide bands, resulting in five health states for the treated eye and five health states for the fellow eye: 25 health states in total. The model assumes that the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the fellow eye is constant. The base case assumes one year of treatment.</p>
<p>The initial patient distribution is taken from the pooled COPERNICUS and GALILEO patient level data.</p>
<p>See Section 5 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for additional discussion of the manufacturer's model.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>

Cost Analysis

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and the critique and exploratory analyses performed by the Evidence Review Group (ERG). It accepted the model structure, but was concerned by some of the uncertainties about the assumptions used by the manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the following uncertainties in the model:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The assumption that the benefits of treatment at 24 weeks would continue indefinitely </li>
    <li>Not including the relative risk of losing 15 or more letters </li>
    <li>The assumption that the duration of aflibercept treatment was 1 year </li>
    <li>The use of European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) data as a source of utility values </li>
    <li>Not including the cost of adverse events </li>
    <li>Not including a stopping rule </li>
    <li>Overestimated administration costs for aflibercept and ranibizumab </li>
    <li>Underestimated costs of blindness </li>
</ul>
<p>The Committee concluded that these uncertainties were unlikely to change the dominance of aflibercept over ranibizumab.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the utility values in the manufacturer's base-case analysis were obtained from the EQ-5D data from GALILEO. The Committee heard from the ERG that using utility values from Czoski-Murray or Brown did not substantially affect the cost-effectiveness estimates of aflibercept compared with ranibizumab.</p>
<p>The Committee was not aware of any substantial benefits of aflibercept over its comparators that were not already captured in the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimation in the modelling.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>
<p>None</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer's sensitivity analyses showed that the cost-effectiveness of aflibercept was sensitive to changes in the number of ranibizumab injections from 0 to 24 weeks and 25 to 52 weeks, the relative risk of gaining 15 or more letters when comparing aflibercept with ranibizumab, the number of aflibercept injections from 25 to 52 weeks, and the number of monitoring visits for ranibizumab from 0 to 52 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the manufacturer's base-case analysis showed that aflibercept dominated ranibizumab (that is, it was more effective and less costly), resulting in more QALYs and lower costs. The Committee considered the uncertainties in the manufacturer's model and noted the ERG's exploratory analysis, which resulted in slightly more cost savings with aflibercept. It also noted that aflibercept continued to dominate ranibizumab despite the changes made by the ERG.</p>
<p>The Committee noted that the ERG's exploratory analysis, which included the confidential discount applied to the list price for aflibercept, resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of &pound;12,300 per QALY gained for aflibercept compared with dexamethasone. The Committee also noted that even using the Brown utilities for the 'better-seeing eye', that is to say, the 'worst case scenario', the ICER was below the top end of the range that would normally be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources (&pound;20,000&ndash;&pound;30,000 per QALY gained).</p>

    <li>Section 7(6) of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/259/contents/made" title="HM Government Web site">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013</a> requires clinical commissioning groups, National Health Service (NHS) England and, with respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the recommendations in this appraisal within 3 months of its date of publication. </li>
    <li>When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraph above. This means that, if a patient has macular oedema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that aflibercept is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. </li>
    <li>The Department of Health and the manufacturer have agreed that aflibercept will be available to the NHS with a patient access scheme which makes aflibercept available with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to communicate details of the discount to the relevant NHS organisations. </li>
    <li>NICE has developed tools to help organisations put this guidance into practice. These are available on the <a href="http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA305" title="NICE Web site">NICE Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </li>
