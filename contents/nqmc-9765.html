Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For effective treatment, therapy should restore serum testosterone to the mid-normal range. This cannot be accomplished without monitoring of serum testosterone. Monitoring testosterone can identify those patients who are under-replaced or are taking excessive doses of testosterone.</p>
<p>The optimal strategies for interval monitoring after therapy vary with the mode of therapy, whether it be transdermal gel, transdermal patch, buccal tablet, or intramuscular injection (McNicholas et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2000; Bhasin et al., 2008; Rosner et al., 2007). When injections are used, documentation of the time after injection at which the level is measured is strongly encouraged to allow appropriate interpretation of the resulting values. Similarly, when testosterone patch is used, the documentation of the hours after the patch is placed can be helpful for interpretation of results. The optimal time of measurement of testosterone in relationship to the mode of testosterone administration is recommended in Table 8 of the Endocrine Society Guideline (Bhasin et al., 2010). To account for these variabilities, a measurement of serum testosterone within 6 months after initiation of therapy is deemed acceptable to meet the accountability measure.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supporting Guideline</span>:</p>
<p>The Endocrine Society suggests monitoring testosterone levels 3 to 6 months after initiation of testosterone therapy (Bhasin et al., 2010).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In population-based surveys of middle aged and older men, symptoms of low libido, erectile dysfunction, hot flushes, fatigue, loss of vigor, irritability, depressed mood, impaired concentration, reduced physical performance, or sleep disturbance, were associated with low testosterone levels. In these surveys, the prevalence of symptomatic androgen deficiency was approximately 6% of the population of middle-aged to older men and increased with age, waist circumference and poor self-reported health status. Hypogonadism is therefore common in American men, yet only 5% of candidates receive treatment.</p>
<p>According to U.S. Census Bureau (2004) projections, the number of Americans ages 65 or older will rise from approximately 35 million (12.4% of all Americans) in 2000 to nearly 55 million (16.3% of total) by 2020 and nearly 87 million (20.7%) in 2050. In addition to a two-fold increase in the number of elderly patients, octogenarians will comprise the fastest-growing population segment according to age (Batchelor, Jollis, &amp; Friesinger, 1999).</p>
<p>This gap in care can profoundly affect the health of our aging men. Even in younger men with symptoms, infertility may be a consequence of androgen deficiency. Male infertility contributes to 50% of all infertility cases. However, both low testosterone and supraphysiologic androgen administration can lead to infertility. The impaired sperm production that supraphysiological testosterone administration causes is often reversible, but in some series has been shown to take anywhere from 3 months to years.</p>
<p>Inappropriate testosterone use is also a major concern of these times. In the sports arena, so far, 45 National Football League (NFL) players have had a ban or suspension placed on them. Among Major League Baseball players, 7% have tested positive for steroids. This inappropriate use has trickled down to the U.S. population. According to ProjectEAT, a five-year, longitudinal study, overall, 1.5% of adolescents reported using steroids (vandenBerg et al., 2007). In a 2002 study by Texas A&amp;M University, it was estimated that up to 42,000 Texas students were abusing steroids.</p>
<p>It is important that testosterone be used to replace hormonal deficiency, and not be used inappropriately in pharmacological doses for enhancement of physical performance or muscular size. The testosterone process measures listed here will assist us to prescribe testosterone to only those individuals in whom it is medically indicated.</p>
<p>Because the diagnosis and management of androgen deficiency in men poses several challenges (symptoms and signs are nonspecific and modified by age, comorbid illness, severity and duration of androgen deficiency, variation in androgen sensitivity, and previous testosterone therapy; evidence of proper care is weak; long-term health consequences of low testosterone levels are unknown for older men and men with chronic illness; the impact of untreated androgen deficiency on mortality is unclear; the benefits and adverse effects of long-term testosterone therapy on patients are not known), these performance measures were determined to be of critical importance to standardize care as outlined in the clinical guidelines.</p></div>
