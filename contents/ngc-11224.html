    <li><strong>Evidence Statements</strong>:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>More time spent outdoors and less time indoors doing near work may slow axial elongation and prevent high myopia thereby reducing the risk of developing sight-threatening conditions such as retinal detachment and myopic retinopathy. (<strong>Evidence Grade: A</strong>) </li>
        <li>More time outside may decrease myopia progression. Less outdoor/sports activity before myopia onset may exert a stronger influence on the development of myopia than near work. (<strong>Evidence Grade: B</strong>) </li>
        <li>Outdoor time and near work do not have a major effect on myopia progression. (<strong>Evidence Grade: B</strong>) </li>
        <li>Higher levels of outdoor activity were associated with lower amounts of myopia in primary school students. (<strong>Evidence Grade: D</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Benefits</strong>: Implementation of this recommendation is likely to help reduce the development and progression of myopia in children </li>
    <li><strong>Potential Risks/Harms</strong>: None </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit and Harm Assessment</strong>: Benefits significantly outweigh harms </li>

<p><strong>Strength of Clinical Recommendation Levels</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong Recommendation</strong>: The benefits of the recommendation clearly exceed the harms (or the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B).

<p><em>This recommendation should be followed unless clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: The benefits of the recommendation exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C). In some clearly identified circumstances, a recommendation may be made on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms.</p>
<p><em>This recommendation should generally be followed, but remain alert for new information.</em></p>
<p><strong>Option</strong>: The benefits of the recommendation exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is low (Grade D) or well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage of one approach versus another.

Clinical questions to be addressed in the guideline were identified and refined during an initial meeting of the GDG and served as the basis for a search of the clinical and research literature.</p>
<p>During six articulation meetings (three face-to-face and three using a Webex platform) of the Evidence-Based Optometry Guideline Development Reading Group (GDRG), all evidence was reviewed and clinical recommendations were developed. The strength level of clinical recommendations was based on the quality grade of the research and the potential benefits and harms of the procedure or therapy recommended. Where high-quality evidence to support a recommendation was weak or lacking, a group consensus was required to approve any consensus recommendations.</p>
<p>Clinical recommendations in this guideline are evidence-based statements regarding patient care that are supported by the scientific literature or consensus of professional opinion when no quality evidence was discovered.</p>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Effective multifaceted implementation strategies targeting all relevant populations affected by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) should be employed by implementers to promote adherence to trustworthy guidelines.</p>
<p>American Optometric Association (AOA) Process:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The AOA Health Promotions Committee is responsible for the released guideline's translation into care. They promote the guideline on the AOA Web site, through the media, to AOA State Affiliates, optometric schools and colleges, Facebook and Twitter. </li>
    <li>They also produce a lecture slide series to be given at state, regional and national meetings where doctors and other caregivers gather for continuing education. </li>
</ul>
<p>Guideline developers should structure the format, vocabulary, and content of CPGs (e.g., specific statements of evidence, the target population) to facilitate ready implementation of computer-aided clinical decision support (CDS) by end-users.</p>
<p>AOA Process:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Guideline Development Group includes a patient and a patient advocate representative to assist in guideline writing for optimum patient and public understanding. </li>
    <li>The guideline posting to the AOA Web site (<a href="https://www.aoa.org/?sso=y" title="AOA Web site">www.AOA.org</a>) is made available to the public and is an electronic format that can be magnified for easier viewing. </li>
    <li>The guideline is also available in pdf format and is sent out upon request. </li>
