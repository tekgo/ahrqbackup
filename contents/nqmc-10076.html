<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients whose parents/guardians (henceforth referred to as parent) reported whether ("Yes, definitely," "Yes, somewhat," "No") the provider prepared them and their child to leave the hospital. </p>
<p>The "Preparing You and Your Child to Leave the Hospital" composite measure is based on five items on the Child Hospital CAHPS (Child HCAHPS) Survey that ask parents whether: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Provider asked parent about child's readiness to leave the hospital </li>
    <li>Provider talked with parent about care after leaving the hospital </li>
    <li>Provider explained when child can resume regular activities </li>
    <li>Provider explained symptoms or problems to look for after leaving the hospital </li>
    <li>Parent received written information about symptoms or problems to look for after leaving the hospital </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Child Hospital CAHPS (Child HCAHPS) Survey assesses the experiences of pediatric patients (age 17 and younger) with inpatient health care received in a hospital. Child HCAHPS asks parents about communication with doctors, communication with nurses, hospital environment, age-appropriateness of care, pain management, and other domains that parents viewed as important aspects of their child's care. By gathering this information, the survey addresses the need to assess and improve the experiences of pediatric inpatients and their parents. </p>
<p>The survey results are expected to be useful to everyone with a need for information on the quality of pediatric inpatient care, including patients, parents, hospitals, health plans, insurers, and policy makers: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients and parents can use the information to help make better and more informed choices about inpatient care. </li>
    <li>Hospitals, health plans, insurers, and policy makers can use the survey results for quality improvement initiatives. To learn more about using the survey for quality improvement, go to Improve Patients' Experiences with Hospitals. </li>
</ol>
<p>Child HCAHPS complements the Adult Hospital CAHPS (Adult HCAHPS) Survey, allowing for patients' hospital experiences to be assessed across the age continuum. Child HCAHPS is harmonized with many of the domains covered in Adult HCAHPS and also includes domains that are particularly relevant to pediatric care, such as how well providers involve teens in their care. </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) identified the need for a standardized survey to assess the experiences of pediatric patients and their families with inpatient hospital care. Consequently, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) funded the Center of Excellence for Pediatric Quality Measurement at Boston Children's Hospital (CEPQM) and assigned it to develop and test a Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Hospital Survey for children. CEPQM worked with the CAHPS Consortium to pursue this effort with the same emphasis on standardization and scientific rigor that characterize all CAHPS products and surveys.</p>
<p>Development of the Child Hospital CAHPS (Child HCAHPS) Survey occurred from 2011 to 2014 and included:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Focus groups</strong>. The survey development team conducted six focus groups with parents of recently hospitalized children and two with recently hospitalized adolescents in Boston, Los Angeles, and St. Louis. Two of these groups were conducted with parents of children with special health care needs. Focus groups were conducted in both English and Spanish and covered several aspects of care important to patients and families. </li>
    <li><strong>Cognitive testing</strong>. The survey development team conducted 109 in-depth cognitive interviews in Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Louis in English and Spanish. The survey developers revised the instrument in response to findings from the interviews, resulting in a 78-item questionnaire used for pilot testing. </li>
    <li><strong>Pilot testing</strong>. The survey development team conducted a pilot test of the draft survey in English and Spanish in eight hospitals across the country. Further survey revision and cognitive interviews led to a 66-item revised draft instrument. </li>
    <li><strong>Field testing</strong>. The survey development team tested the revised draft instrument with parents of recently hospitalized children in 69 hospitals across 34 states. The survey was fielded in both English and Spanish by either mail or phone. Based on comprehensive psychometric analyses of the field test data, the survey team made revisions to the questionnaire. </li>
    <li><strong>End-user testing</strong>. The survey development team conducted 23 cognitive interviews with parents in Atlanta and the Washington, D.C., area to test the understandability and usefulness of preliminary composite measure concepts and labels. Based on the findings from these interviews, the team refined the list of 18 composite, single-item, and rating measures and modified their labels. </li>

Description of Allowance for Patient or Population Factors
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>When comparing hospitals, it is necessary to adjust appropriately for case-mix differences. Case-mix refers to patient characteristics, such as demographic characteristics and health status, that are not under the control of the hospital and may affect scores on performance measures. Systematic effects of this sort create the potential for a hospital's rating to be higher or lower because of characteristics of its patient population rather than the quality of care it provides. Comparisons of unadjusted scores may therefore be misleading. The basic goal of adjusting for case mix is to estimate how different hospitals would score if they all provided care to comparable groups of patients. </p>
<p>Analyses of the Child Hospital CAHPS (Child HCAHPS) Survey pilot data were conducted to examine the effects of patients' characteristics on parent report of hospital care. Child HCAHPS includes adjustment of hospital scores for patient characteristics that are associated with Child HCAHPS measures and are differentially distributed across hospitals. The case-mix data are obtained from items in the "About You" section of the survey and from hospital administrative records. Based on findings from the pilot data analyses and consistent with previous studies of case-mix adjustment in CAHPS and other hospital patient surveys, Child HCAHPS uses the following categorical variables in the case-mix adjustment model: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Child age </li>
    <li>Child global health status </li>
    <li>Respondent age </li>
    <li>Respondent education </li>
