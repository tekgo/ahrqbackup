<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of recommendation (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak/conditional</strong>) and levels of evidence (<strong>high</strong>, <strong>moderate</strong>, <strong>low</strong> or <strong>very low</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>In trauma patients with open or closed femur fractures, the panel suggests early (&lt;24 hours) open reduction and internal fracture fixation. This recommendation is conditional, and the strength of the evidence is low. Early stabilization of femur fractures shows a trend (statistically insignificant) toward lower risk of infection, mortality, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, the panel concludes that the desirable effects of early femur fracture stabilization probably outweigh the undesirable effects in most patients. <strong>Conditional recommendation (low quality of evidence)</strong>.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inclusion Criteria for This Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Study Types</strong></p>
<p>For the purpose of making recommendations, studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective observational or retrospective studies, and case-control studies. Only studies pertaining to open reduction and internal fixation of open or closed femur fractures were included.</p>
<p><strong>Participant Types</strong></p>
<p>The panel included studies with adult patients, any sex, and with no restriction on inclusion of ethnicities or patients with comorbidities. Meta-analyses, case reports, letters, and reviews containing no original data or comments were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Intervention Type</strong></p>
<p>The panel included studies comparing open reduction and internal fixation performed within 24 hours from the time of injury to stabilization performed greater than 24 hours after injury.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measure Types</strong></p>
<p>An initial list of all relevant outcomes (infection, nonunion/ malunion, compartment syndrome, venous thromboembolism (VTE), fat embolism syndrome, regional pain, neurologic impairment, arthritis, hardware failure, impaired function, mortality, or amputation) was generated and distributed to panelists. Eight panelists independently rated the relative importance of each outcome on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (less important) to 9 (critically important for decision making). The five highest rated outcomes were selected as follows: mortality, infection, VTE, nonunion/malunion, and amputation. A systematic review of the literature was then conducted to identify relevant articles. Each article was evaluated independently by three members of the committee to extract pertinent data. The panel did not find any articles with data regarding the outcomes of nonunion/malunion and amputation, so these outcomes were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>Other outcomes considered were respiratory complications of fixation such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, fat embolism, pneumonia, and other pulmonary dysfunction. However, these outcomes were not included in this review.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The literature search and appraisal were based on guidelines for systematic reviews. A MEDLINE and Cochrane search was conducted to identify English language human subjects prospective RCTs, non-RCTs, existing systematic reviews, guidelines, case-control, and observational studies published before November 2013. Search terms included (1) <em>femoral fractures</em>, (2) <em>long bone stabilization</em>, (3) <em>timing fixation</em>, (4) <em>delayed fixation</em>, (5) <em>early fixation</em>, (6) <em>immediate fixation</em>, (7) <em>fracture fixation</em>, (8) <em>timing fracture</em>, and (9) <em>timing osteosynthesis</em>, alone or in combination. In addition to the electronic search, the bibliographies of relevant articles and systematic reviews were hand searched to find additional potentially appropriate publications to be included in this review.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>A single panelist conducted the literature search and assessed the titles and abstracts to identify relevant publications, applying inclusion criteria. Case reports and review articles were excluded. The resulting studies then underwent full-text review by three independent reviewers to determine appropriateness for inclusion.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Results</strong></span></p>
<p>The panel retrieved 9,091 articles during the first phase of the literature search, of which 9,032 were excluded by duplicate removal and title review (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). Fifty-nine articles addressing optimal timing of long bone fracture stabilization underwent a full review to identify 11 studies comparing early (&lt;24 hours) versus late (&gt;24 hours) open reduction and internal fixation of femur fractures in trauma patients.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Data Extraction and Management</strong></p>
<p>Data were extracted by a single reviewer, confirmed by two other reviewers, and entered into Review Manager X.6 (RevMan). Information included authorship, publication year, methodology of the study, population, intervention, and relevant outcome measures.</p>
<p><strong>Methodological Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The articles were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The quality of evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or insufficient for each outcome (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). The quality of evidence is reflected as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect is correct and includes an explicit consideration of the following domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.</p>
<p><strong>Measures of Treatment Effect</strong></p>
<p>The panel created a detailed set of evidence tables containing all abstracted information. Clinical outcomes, including mortality, infection, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) reported in each included study, were individually pooled for meta-analysis. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each study using a random-effects model. A <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. STATA 12.1 (College Station, TX) statistical analysis software was used for all statistical analyses. There were not enough data to undertake meta-analysis for the other two outcomes (nonunion/malunion and amputations).</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Heterogeneity</strong></p>
<p>Potential heterogeneity existed because of population differences, different types of surgery, and how patients were defined. The panel examined these differences across studies to assess clinical and methodological heterogeneity. For the meta-analysis, they used RevMan to calculate the I2 statistic to determine the proportion of variation between studies attributable to heterogeneity, and variation was categorized as "low" (<em>I</em><sup>2</sup>=25%-49%), "moderate" (<em>I</em><sup>2</sup>=50%-74%), or "high" (<em>I</em><sup>2</sup>=74%-100%).</p></div>

Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
    <li>This guideline represents a very detailed summary of the literature regarding open reduction and internal fixation of femur fractures and surgical timing and is meant to inform the decision-making process, not replace clinical judgment. The optimal timing for internal fixation remains controversial. </li>
