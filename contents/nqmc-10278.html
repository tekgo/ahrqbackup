Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the estimated annual incidence rate of all musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) involving days away from work per 100,000 full-time equivalents (FTEs) in the private industry sector.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>State health agencies, which are vested with the legal authority to require disease reporting and collect health data, play a central role in public health surveillance. Whereas public health surveillance was once focused primarily on infectious diseases, it has expanded in recent years to include surveillance of a wide range of health outcomes and their determinants, including chronic diseases, injuries and health behaviors (Halperin &amp; Horan, 1998). National statistics on occupational injuries and illnesses have been collected largely outside of the public health infrastructure and rely almost entirely on data reported by employers. State health agencies that have access to a wide variety of public health data systems have an important role in the surveillance of occupational diseases, injuries and hazards.</p>
<p>Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are preventable and control of occupational hazards is the most effective means of prevention. Estimating the burden and tracking these injuries helps target prevention programs and activities. Information on reported cases can be used to identify contributory factors and develop improved or new prevention strategies or regulations to protect workers.</p></div>

A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 2014, about one-third (n=298,460) of all lost workday cases reported by private sector employers in the United States were due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). This equates to a rate of 319 musculoskeletal disorder cases per 100,000 full-time workers. Forty percent of all MSD cases involved an injury to the back and almost one third (29.8%) involved injury to the upper extremities (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2016).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 1998, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), in association with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), convened the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group to make recommendations to NIOSH concerning State-based surveillance activities for the coming decade. </p>
<p>The Work Group recognized the need to pilot test 19 indicators to assess the feasibility of widespread implementation and to develop specific guidance on how to compute the proposed measures. In summer 2002, the five "Core" states with NIOSH Cooperative Agreements to conduct "Core Occupational Health Surveillance" (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Washington) agreed to pilot test the indicators and to create user-friendly "how-to" guides so that other states could calculate the indicators. </p>
<p>Subsequent to the initial pilot testing by the five "Core" states, eight additional states (Connecticut, Maine, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin) pilot tested the "how-to" guides. Feedback from these additional states was incorporated into the development of the final "how-to" guides for 19 indicators in November 2004.</p>
<p>Procedures to review, approve, and implement new indicators were developed by the Work Group. In 2013, a fourteenth health effect indicator (<em>Asthma among Adults Caused or Made Worse by Work</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-first indicator. In 2014, a fifteenth health effect indicator (<em>Work-Related Severe Traumatic Injury Hospitalizations</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-second indicator. </p></div>
