<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Acute respiratory illness (ARI) is defined as one or more of the following: cough, sputum production, chest pain, or dyspnea (with or without fever). The workup of a patient with ARI, including the need for chest radiography and computed tomography (CT), depends on many factors, including severity of the illness; age of patient; presence of fever, leukocytosis, or hypoxemia; clinical history; presence of other risk factors; and physical examination. Not all studies concur as to which patients with ARI should have chest radiographs.</p>
<p>One study of 1,102 outpatients with ARI found patient age, the physical examination, and the presence or absence of hemoptysis to be important factors. Only 4% (7/175) of patients younger than age 40 with symptoms of ARI, a negative physical examination, and no hemoptysis had acute significant radiographic findings, whereas patients either older than age 40 with hemoptysis or with a positive physical examination, such as the presence of wheezing, had a much higher incidence of chest radiograph abnormalities. Another study of 464 patients with ARI also found a low incidence (3%) of pneumonia in patients with negative physical examinations. A notable exception was found for patients with dementia, in whom the incidence of pneumonia was very high regardless of the results of the physical examination. Another group of researchers studied 79 outpatients presenting with clinical suspicion of pneumonia and concluded that radiographs should be ordered only when patients present with fever, cough, sputum production, and coarse crackles on physical examination. Conversely, another study of 221 patients with ARI found that 77 (35%) had new clinically important findings. Furthermore, the clinical findings did not differ significantly between those with positive radiographic findings and those with negative findings (i.e., clinical history and physical examination were poor predictors of radiography-detected abnormalities). A study that evaluated 192 patients with a clinical suspicion of pneumonia by general practitioners found that the probability of pneumonia was changed by chest radiographic results in 53% of patients, with a decrease in probability in 47% and an increase in probability in 6%.</p>
<p><strong>Pneumonia</strong></p>
<p>In a series of 300 patients with acute cough illness, it was found that for patients with a high pretest probability of pneumonia, a radiograph was not always obtained in clinical practice; the study authors infer that when the clinical probability of pneumonia exceeds a certain level, a negative radiograph would not alter treatment decisions by clinicians. Another series that included 2,706 patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) similarly showed that 911 (one-third) of them had radiographs initially interpreted as negative for pneumonia, with minimal change in this interpretation on retrospective review of a random subgroup. The groups with positive and negative radiographs had similar rates of positive sputum cultures and blood cultures. These 2 studies call into question the utility of radiographs in patients with high pretest probability of pneumonia. Researchers developed a prediction rule for the use of chest radiographs in evaluating for CAP and in a 70-patient series, in both the outpatient and emergency setting. They concluded that chest radiographs are unnecessary in patients with normal vital signs and physical examination findings. However, because approximately 5% of cases would be missed, their criteria are only useful for patients with reliable follow-up and a low likelihood of morbidity if CAP is not detected initially. Another study showed that 21% of 105 patients hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis of CAP initially had negative chest radiographs, with over one-half of the 9 patients who had subsequent radiographic studies within 48 hours of hospitalization developing opacities.</p>
<p>Patients with substance abuse have an increased risk of ARI due to two potential conditions: respiratory pump failure and pulmonary pathology. Respiratory pump failure generally does not have radiographic manifestations. However pulmonary pathology includes multiple diagnosis with chest radiographic manifestations, including aspiration, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, hemorrhage, and septic emboli.</p>
<p>According to the guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society, chest radiography should be obtained whenever pneumonia is suspected in adults to establish the diagnosis and to aid in differentiating CAP from other common causes of cough and fever, such as acute bronchitis. Findings on chest radiographs are one of several parameters used to determine: 1) which patients should be hospitalized (presence of pleural effusion); 2) which patients should be classified as having severe pneumonia (multilobar involvement); and 3) which patients may require additional diagnostic testing (cavitation, pleural effusion), including thoracentesis (pleural effusions &gt;5 cm on lateral upright radiograph). CT may show findings in patients with normal radiographs, but the significance of these findings and therefore the utility of CT in patients with clinically suspected pneumonia and negative radiographs is unclear. One study found that in 27% of patients (out of 97) presenting to the emergency department with both a chest radiograph study and a CT scan performed in the workup of varied chief complaints, pneumonia was demonstrated on a CT scan in the face of a negative or nondiagnostic chest radiograph study. As in the study mentioned above, they recommend that when the chief complaint is fever, cough or chest pain in patients with serious comorbidities, obtaining a CT scan in the setting of a negative chest radiograph study would seem to be necessary.</p>
<p>Additionally, CT may play a role in the management of severe pneumonia. It can serve as a guide for pleural drainage or to localize an appropriate site for biopsy. However, its use for potentially differentiating bacterial and nonbacterial pneumonias remains limited. Severe pneumonias bear a strong relationship to etiologic pathogens and have implications for antimicrobial treatment. Patients with severe pneumonia should be considered as candidates for admission to an intensive care unit.</p>
<p><strong>Asthma</strong></p>
<p>The need for chest radiographs in adult patients with acute asthma is controversial. One group of researchers found clinically important (i.e., affecting patient management) radiographic findings in 9% of their patients and concluded that chest radiography is indicated. However, other researchers observed that 99% of their patients either had normal chest radiographic examinations or showed only slightly prominent markings or hyperinflation. Another study reported that patients with acute asthma rarely have pneumonia. Chest radiographs were recommended only when pneumonia or pneumothorax is suspected. Significant chest radiographic abnormalities were found in 34% of adults whose asthma exacerbation warranted admission to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</strong></p>
<p>The utility of chest radiography was studied in 242 patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (i.e., dyspnea). Of this group, 135 patients (56%) had asthma, and 107 (44%) had emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Chest radiographs were abnormal in 14% but resulted in significant change in management in only 4.5%. The authors of the study concluded that the chest radiograph is indicated only if the worsening dyspnea is accompanied by leukocytosis, chest pain, or edema or by a history of coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure (CHF).</p>
<p>It is estimated that bacterial infection is a factor in 70% to 75% of COPD exacerbations; up to 60% caused by <em>Streptococcus pneumonia</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> or <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>. The latter, a nosocomial respiratory tract pathogen, is the causative agent particularly in older adults. The CT findings of 109 patients with acute <em>M. catarrhalis</em> pulmonary infection were reviewed; the most common were ground-glass opacity followed by bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, consolidation and bronchiectasis with basal and peripheral predominance.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Chest radiography seems warranted in ARI when one or more of the following are present: older than age 40; dementia; a positive physical examination; hemoptysis; associated abnormalities (leukocytosis, hypoxemia); or other risk factors, including coronary artery disease, CHF, or drug-induced acute respiratory failure. </li>
    <li>Chest radiography also seems warranted for any adult patient with clinical suspicion of pneumonia, although some clinicians may choose not to perform radiography if clinical suspicion of respiratory infection is sufficiently high to warrant treatment if a radiograph were to be negative. </li>
    <li>It appears that in patients with ARI who are younger than age 40, chest radiography is not routinely indicated unless there are other abnormalities, a positive physical examination, or other risk factors. </li>
    <li>It also appears that chest radiography is not indicated in most patients with exacerbations of COPD (including asthma) unless there is a suspected complication such as pneumonia or pneumothorax or unless one or more of the following are present: leukocytosis, chest pain, edema, or a history of coronary artery disease or CHF. </li>
    <li>Chest CT may be warranted in complicated cases of severe pneumonia and in febrile neutropenic patients with normal or nonspecific chest radiographic findings. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Search Procedure</strong></p>
<p>Staff will search in PubMed only for peer reviewed medical literature for routine searches. Any article or guideline may be used by the author in the narrative but those materials may have been identified outside of the routine literature search process.</p>
<p>The Medline literature search is based on keywords provided by the topic author. The two general classes of keywords are those related to the condition (e.g., ankle pain, fever) and those that describe the diagnostic or therapeutic intervention of interest (e.g., mammography, MRI).</p>
<p>The search terms and parameters are manipulated to produce the most relevant, current evidence to address the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria (ACR AC) topic being reviewed or developed. Combining the clinical conditions and diagnostic modalities or therapeutic procedures narrows the search to be relevant to the topic. Exploding the term "diagnostic imaging" captures relevant results for diagnostic topics.</p>
<p>The following criteria/limits are used in the searches.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Articles that have abstracts available and are concerned with humans. </li>
    <li>Restrict the search to the year prior to the last topic update or in some cases the author of the topic may specify which year range to use in the search. For new topics, the year range is restricted to the last 10 years unless the topic author provides other instructions. </li>
    <li>May restrict the search to Adults only or Pediatrics only. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>The topic author drafts or revises the narrative text summarizing the evidence found in the literature. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff draft an evidence table based on the analysis of the selected literature. These tables rate the strength of the evidence (study quality) for each article included in the narrative text.</p>
<p>The expert panel reviews the narrative text, evidence table, and the supporting literature for each of the topic-variant combinations and assigns an appropriateness rating for each procedure listed in the table. Each individual panel member assigns a rating based on his/her interpretation of the available evidence.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Rating Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p>The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures included in the Appropriateness Criteria topics are determined using a modified Delphi methodology. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff distribute surveys to the panelists along with the evidence table and narrative. Each panelist interprets the available evidence and rates each procedure. The surveys are completed by panelists without consulting other panelists. The appropriateness rating scale is an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category "usually not appropriate"; 4, 5, or 6 are in the category "may be appropriate"; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category "usually appropriate." Each panel member assigns one rating for each procedure for a clinical scenario. The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating.</p>
<p>If consensus is reached, the median rating is assigned as the panel's final recommendation/rating. Consensus is defined as eighty percent (80%) agreement within a rating category. A maximum of three rounds may be conducted to reach consensus. Consensus among the panel members must be achieved to determine the final rating for each procedure.</p>
<p>If consensus is not reached, the panel is convened by conference call. The strengths and weaknesses of each imaging procedure that has not reached consensus are discussed and a final rating is proposed. If the panelists on the call agree, the rating is proposed as the panel's consensus. The document is circulated to all the panelists to make the final determination. If consensus cannot be reached on the call or when the document is circulated, "No consensus" appears in the rating column and the reasons for this decision are added to the comment sections.</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to express individual interpretations of the evidence and his or her expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized and economical process. A more detailed explanation of the complete process can be found in additional methodology documents found on the <a href="http://www.acr.org/ac" title="ACR Web site">ACR Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Relative Radiation Level (RRL)</strong></p>
<p>Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria&reg; Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination.</p></div>
