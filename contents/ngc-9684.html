<p><strong>Key Action Statement 1A</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should diagnose acute otitis media (AOM) in children who present with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane (TM) <em>or</em> new onset of otorrhea not due to acute otitis externa. <strong>(Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Recommendation)</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Action Statement Profile: KAS 1A</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>Grade B</strong> </li>
    <li>Benefits: Identify a population of children most likely to benefit from intervention. Avoid unnecessary treatment of those without highly certain acute otitis media (AOM). Promote consistency in diagnosis. </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, cost: May miss AOM that presents with a combination of mild bulging, intense erythema, or otalgia that may not necessarily represent less severe disease and may also benefit from intervention. </li>
    <li>Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Identification of a population of children with highly certain AOM is beneficial. Accurate, specific diagnosis is helpful to the individual patient. Modification of current behavior of overdiagnosis is a goal. Increased specificity is preferred even as sensitivity is lowered. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: By using stringent diagnostic criteria, the tympanic membrane (TM) appearance of less severe illness that might be early AOM has not been addressed. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Strength: <strong>Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Notes: Tympanocentesis studies confirm that using these diagnostic findings leads to high levels of isolation of pathogenic bacteria. Evidence is extrapolated from treatment studies that included tympanocentesis. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 1B</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should diagnose AOM in children who present with mild bulging of the TM <em>and</em> recent (less than 48 hours) onset of ear pain (holding, tugging, rubbing of the ear in a nonverbal child) or intense erythema of the TM. <strong>(Evidence Quality: Grade C, Rec. Strength: Recommendation)</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Action Statement Profile: KAS 1B</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>Grade C</strong> </li>
    <li>Benefits: Identify AOM in children when the diagnosis is not highly certain. </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, cost: Overdiagnosis of AOM. Reduced precision in diagnosis. </li>
    <li>Benefits-harms assessment: Benefits greater than harms </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Criteria may be more subjective. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Strength: <strong>Recommendation</strong> </li>
    <li>Notes: Recent onset of ear pain means within the past 48 hours. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 1C</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should not diagnose AOM in children who do not have middle ear effusion (MEE) (based on pneumatic otoscopy and/or tympanometry). <strong>(Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Recommendation)</strong></p>
<p><em>Key Action Statement Profile: KAS 1C</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: <strong>Grade B</strong> </li>
    <li>Benefits: Reduces overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Increases correct diagnosis of other conditions with symptoms that otherwise might be attributed to AOM. Promotes the use of pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry to improve diagnostic accuracy. </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, cost: Cost of tympanometry. Need to acquire or reacquire skills in pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry for some clinicians. </li>
    <li>Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: AOM is overdiagnosed, often without adequate visualization of the TM. Early AOM without effusion occurs, but the risk of over-diagnosis supersedes that concern. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: Early AOM evidenced by intense erythema of the TM </li>
    <li>Strength: <strong>Recommendation</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 2</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Key Action Statement 3C</strong></p>
<p><em>Nonsevere Unilateral AOM in Young Children</em></p>
<p>The clinician should either prescribe antibiotic therapy <em>or</em> offer observation with close follow-up based on joint decision-making with the parent(s)/caregiver for unilateral AOM in children 6 months to 23 months of age without severe signs or symptoms (i.e., mild otalgia for less than 48 hours and temperature less than 39&deg;C [102.2&deg;F]). When observation is used, a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotic therapy if the child worsens or fails to improve within 48 to 72 hours of onset of symptoms. <strong>(Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec.

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence Report</strong></p>
<p>In preparing for the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, the AHRQ funded and conducted an exhaustive review of the literature on diagnosis and management of acute otitis media (AOM). In 2008, the AHRQ and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center began a similar process of reviewing the literature published since the 2001 AHRQ report. The AAP again partnered with AHRQ and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop the evidence report, which served as a major source of data for these practice guideline recommendations.</p>
<p>For the 2010 review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Education Resources Information Center were conducted by using the same search strategies used for the 2001 report for publications from 1998 through June 2010. Additional terms or conditions not considered in the 2001 review (recurrent OM, new drugs, and heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine) were also included. The Web of Science was also used to search for citations of the 2001 report and its peer-reviewed publications. Titles were screened independently by 2 pediatricians with experience in conducting systematic reviews.</p>
<p>For the question pertaining to diagnosis, efficacy, and safety, the search was primarily for clinical trials. For the question pertaining to the effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) on epidemiology and microbiology, the group searched for trials that compared microbiology in the same populations before and after introduction of the vaccine or observational studies that compared microbiology across vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.</p>
<p><strong>AAP Methods</strong></p>
<p>New literature on otitis media (OM) is continually being published. Although the systematic review performed by AHRQ could not be replicated with new literature, members of the Subcommittee on Diagnosis and Management of Acute Otitis Media reviewed additional articles. PubMed was searched by using the single search term "acute otitis media," approximately every 6 months from June 2009 through October 2011 to obtain new articles.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence Report</strong> (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field)</p>
<p>Investigators abstracted data into standard evidence tables, with accuracy checked by a second investigator. Studies were quality-rated by 2 investigators by using established criteria. For randomized controlled trials, the Jadad criteria were used. Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria were used to evaluate the studies that pertained to diagnosis. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were applied to pooled analyses. Data abstracted included parameters necessary to define study groups, inclusion/exclusion criteria, influencing factors, and outcome measures. Some of the data for analysis were abstracted by a biostatistician and checked by a physician reviewer. A sequential resolution strategy was used to match and resolve the screening and review results of the 2 pediatrician reviewers.</p>
<p>For the assessment of treatment efficacy, pooled analyses were performed for comparisons for which 3 or more trials could be identified. Studies eligible for analyses of questions pertaining to treatment efficacy were grouped for comparisons by treatment options. Each comparison consisted of studies that were considered homogeneous across clinical practice. Because some of the key questions were addressed in the 2001 evidence report, studies identified in that report were included with newly identified articles in the 2010 evidence report.</p>
<p>Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations as well as expert consensus when definitive data were not available. Results of the literature review were presented in evidence tables and published in the final evidence report.</p>
<p><strong>American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Methods</strong></p>
<p>Subcommittee members evaluated pertinent articles for quality of methodology and importance of results. Selected articles used in the AHRQ review were also reevaluated for their quality.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>In June 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a new subcommittee to review and revise the May 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) guideline. The subcommittee comprised primary care physicians and experts in the fields of pediatrics, family practice, otolaryngology, epidemiology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, and guideline methodology.</p>
<p>Conclusions were based on the consensus of the subcommittee after the review of newer literature and reevaluation of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) evidence. Key action statements were generated using BRIDGE-Wiz (Building Recommendations in a Developers Guideline Editor), an interactive software tool that leads guideline development through a series of questions that are intended to create a more actionable set of key action statements. BRIDGE-Wiz also incorporates the quality of available evidence into the final determination of the strength of each recommendation.</p></div>
