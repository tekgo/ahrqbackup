Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of December 2016. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/InptCVC/CVC.final.pdf" title="University of Michigan Health System Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the original guideline document for additional information.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-E) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Points</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong> (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In any patient with a central vascular catheter (CVC) and clinical suspicion for line infection, blood cultures should be drawn. Do <strong>not</strong> draw blood cultures routinely via a CVC, unless CVC infection is suspected. <em>[IA]</em> </li>
    <li>Blood cultures should be obtained prior to the initiation of antibiotics, <em>unless</em> the patient is unstable or critically ill (necessitating immediate initiation of antimicrobials, regardless of whether blood cultures have been obtained). <em>[IB]</em>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>When infection is suspected, at least 2 sets of cultures should be drawn (aerobic &amp; anaerobic). <em>[IIB]</em> </li>
        <li>Blood cultures should be drawn from peripheral site and the central line if catheter infection is suspected <em>[IB]</em>. Blood cultures should not be drawn from central catheters routinely. <em>[IIID]</em> </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Empiric treatment should be initiated after blood cultures are obtained (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). <em>[IC]</em> </li>
    <li>Definitive antimicrobial therapy should be tailored to the organism identified and the susceptibilities of that organism (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). <em>[IC]</em> </li>
    <li>The preferred management of confirmed CVC infection includes removal of the central vascular catheter in most cases. <em>[ID]</em> </li>
    <li>There are different considerations for short-term and non-tunneled hemodialysis CVC (see Figure 3 in the original guideline document), long-term CVC (see Figure 4 in the original guideline document), and tunneled hemodialysis CVC (see Figure 5 in the original guideline document). <em>[IC]</em> </li>
    <li>Unless there is an urgent need for central vascular access, new central vascular catheter placement should be delayed until 48 hours after the first negative blood cultures when treating any bacteremia, including CVC-related bacteremia. <em>[IC]</em> </li>
    <li>CVC removal and infectious disease consultation is recommended for any of the following situations related to CVC infections: cultures positive for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> or <em>Candida</em> species; persistent bacteremia with any organism after 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy; persistence of septic shock; presence of an intravascular prosthetic device (e.g., mechanical valve, pacemaker, or automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [AICD]); or development of any complication (e.g., endocarditis, osteomyelitis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, or others). <em>[IC]</em> </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strategy for Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>Within the Medline (Ovid) database, the following search strategy was used for most of the search topics, except for the searches on suppurative thrombosis, endocarditis, and vascular infection. The search below is identified as Main in the search strategies document. Because the appropriate indexing terms either do not exist or were applied inconsistently, the main search uses keywords in addition to MeSH terms to arrive at the following main strategy.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>*Central Venous Catheters/ or *Catheterization, Central Venous/ or (central line or central lines or ("central venous" and (catheter* or line or lines)) or "central line associated" or "catheter related").ti. </li>
    <li>("peripherally inserted central" and (line or lines or port or ports or catheter*)).mp. or (PICC or PICCS).ti,ab. or *catheters, indwelling/ </li>
    <li>1 or 2 </li>
    <li>Cross Infection/ or exp *Sepsis/ or exp *Catheter-Related Infections/ or exp *Bacterial Infections/ or *infection/ or *Prosthesis-Related Infections/ </li>

    <li>(CLABSI* or CRBSI* or CR-BSI*).ti,ab. </li>
    <li>5 or 6 </li>
</ol>
<p>The searches on suppurative thrombosis, endocarditis, and vascular infection used the first 3 searches of the main search strategy. The MEDLINE In-Process search was based entirely on keywords.</p>
<p>Results were limited to: Humans, English, and 2008 to current. The Main search retrieved 391 references. When the search hedges for Guidelines, Clinical Trials, and Cohort Studies were added, the base results are as follows: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Central Line Infection - Guidelines, total results were 28 </li>
    <li>Central Line Infection - Clinical Trials, total results were 187 </li>
    <li>Central Line Infection - Cohort Studies, total results were 402 </li>
</ul>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available from the guideline authors upon request). The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Central vascular catheter (CVC) infections have a significant impact on patient morbidity, mortality and costs associated with medical care. In a recent analysis, CVC infections were found to be the most costly healthcare-associated infection at $45,814 per infection. CVC infections are also one of the most deadly healthcare-associated infections, with a mortality rate of 12% to 15%. Implementation of CVC infection management guidelines is intended to improve appropriate early antimicrobial treatment of bloodstream infections, standardize infected CVC management and improve patient outcomes.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There are some circumstances in which the removal of the infected catheter may not be possible. These are usually circumstances in which either (a) replacing the central vascular catheter (CVC) in another location is not possible (e.g., multiple areas of thrombosis or stenosis or the patient is pediatric with limited access opportunities) or (b) removing the catheter carries prohibitive risk and the benefits of salvage may outweigh the risks of removal. In cases where removal is not possible, the CVC may be left in place during initial antibiotic treatment. In such cases, the clinician must carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of alternative treatments on an individual basis and with the benefit of additional expert guidance. When <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, fungus or mycobacteria are present, rates of treatment failure with catheters left in place are high, and in those catheters that fail salvage there is a high incidence of complications stemming from the infection. </li>
    <li>Data supporting the practice of changing CVCs over a wire are weak. In such cases, the clinician must carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of guidewire exchange on an individual basis and with the benefit of additional expert guidance. </li>
    <li>Insertion of a CVC in the presence of an active bloodstream infection may result in colonization and infection of the new catheter, resulting in relapse of bacteremia after treatment. A recent small study showed that peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) placed within two days of documented bacteremia had an increased risk of relapse of bacteremia (6.5%) when compared to PICCs place at least three days after documentation of negative blood culture (0.3%). In clinical scenarios where there is ongoing need for central vascular access, clinicians must weigh the risk/benefit of placing a new CVC in the setting of active bacteremia. </li>
