Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of April 2013. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/fhp/practiceguides/om.html" title="University of Michigan Health System Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text for additional information, including detailed information on dosing, possible side effects, and cost of medications, as well as considerations for special populations and special situations.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Distinguish between acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME). Symptoms of pain or fever, together with an inflammatory middle ear effusion, are required to make a diagnosis of AOM <em>[I, D]</em>. </li>
    <li>The presence of middle ear effusion should be determined by the combined use of otoscopy, pneumatic otoscopy, and tympanometry when necessary <em>[I, D]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Therapy of AOM</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Recommend adequate analgesia for all children with AOM <em>[I, D]</em>. </li>
    <li>Consider deferring antibiotic therapy for lower risk children with AOM <em>[II, A]</em>. </li>
    <li>When antibiotic therapy is deferred, facilitate patient access to antibiotics if symptoms worsen (e.g., a "back-up" prescription given at visit or a convenient system for subsequent call-in) <em>[I, C]</em>.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Amoxicillin is the first choice of antibiotic therapy for all cases of AOM.
        <p><em>Children</em>:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Dosing: &lt;4 years, 80 mg/kg/day divided twice a day (BID); &ge;4 years, 40-60 mg/kg/day <em>[I, C]</em>. </li>
            <li>Duration 5-10 days: 5 days is usually sufficient at lower cost and fewer side effects, although 10 days reduces clinical failure <em>[A]</em>. Consider 10-day course for children with significant early upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms and &lt;2 years old, with possible sinusitis, and with possible strep throat <em>[II, D]</em>. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Adults</em>: either 875 mg BID x 10 days or 500 mg 2 tabs BID x 10 days <em>[I, C]</em>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event of allergy to amoxicillin, azithromycin (Zithromax) dosed at 30 mg/kg for one dose is the appropriate first line therapy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Treat AOM that is clinically unresponsive to amoxicillin after 72 hours of therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin ES; amoxicillin component 80 mg/kg/day divided BID) for 10 days or with azithromycin (Zithromax) 20 mg/kg daily for 3 days <em>[II, C]</em>. </li>
    <li>Patients with significant, persistent symptoms on high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin ES) or azithromycin (Zithromax) may respond to intramuscular (IM) ceftriaxone (Rocephin; 1-3 doses) <em>[II, C]</em>. The decision to use ceftriaxone (Rocephin) should take into account the negative impact it will have on local antibiotic resistance patterns. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Therapy of OME</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Children with middle ear effusions should be examined at 3 month intervals for clearance of the effusion <em>[I, D]</em>. </li>
    <li>Children with evidence of mucoid effusions or anatomic damage to the middle ear should be referred to otolaryngology if effusion or abnormal physical findings persist for 3 months <em>[I, D]</em>. </li>
    <li>Children with apparent serous effusions should be referred to otolaryngology if effusion persists for 6 months and there is evidence of hearing loss or language delay <em>[I, D]</em>. </li>
    <li>Children with an asymptomatic middle ear effusion (no apparent developmental or behavioral problems) can be followed without referral <em>[I, B]</em>. </li>
    <li>Parents of all children with OME should be informed about approaches to maximize language development in a child with a possible hearing loss <em>[I, C]</em>. </li>
    <li>Decongestants and other nasal steroids have been shown not to decrease middle ear effusions <em>[IIIA]</em>. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The guideline team had access to the literature searches performed for the initial version of this guideline (1997) and its updates (2002, 2006). For this update the literature search began with a review updated Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence Report on Management of Acute Otitis Media, which included a systematic review of literature through July 2010 (see annotated references in the original guideline document). To supplement these searches with more recent findings, the team then conducted a prospective search of literature published on Medline from 7/1/10 to 9/30/12 (unless otherwise noted) using the major keywords of: human, English language, guidelines, controlled trials, and cohort studies. Eleven specific searches were performed using the following terms. Detailed search terms and strategy available upon request.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Otitis media with effusion or serous effusion: audiogram or otoacoustic emissions, diagnosis, treatment (since 6/1/06) </li>
    <li>Recurrent otitis media, recurrent acute OM, or chronic or persistent OM: diagnosis, treatment </li>
    <li>Acute otitis media since (not recurrent, persistent, or chronic [addressed in #2]): etiology and natural history, diagnosis (signs and symptoms, hearing loss, delayed language development, otoscopy, pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, tympanocentesis, other diagnosis). treatment (antibiotic therapy [amoxicillin, cephalosporins, other antibiotics], adjunctive therapy (corticosteroid, antihistamines, decongestants, other), myringotomy or tympanostomy tubes, laser tympanostomy or laser myringotomy, complementary/alternative treatment (since 1/1/2001), other treatment </li>
    <li>Otitis media: infants 0&ndash;4 weeks (since 1/1/2001), diagnosis, treatment </li>
    <li>Otitis media: adults (since 1/1/2001), diagnosis, treatment </li>
    <li>Otitis media and mastoiditis </li>
    <li>Otitis media and screening for speech delay </li>
    <li>Otitis media not in #1&ndash;#7: diagnosis, treatment </li>
    <li>Cerumen impaction: treatment (since 6/1/06) </li>
    <li>Otorrhea: treatment </li>
    <li>Probiotic bacteria after antibiotics (since 6/1/06) </li>
</ol>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clinicians overestimate the extent to which clinical failure is due to antibiotic resistance, and overestimate the likelihood that second line medications will cover resistant organisms. </li>
    <li>The use of beta-lactamase resistant antibiotics may promote colonization with resistant organisms. </li>
    <li>Diarrhea and candidal infections are among the most common complications of antibiotic therapy. Therefore parents should be warned about this in advance. It is also appropriate to provide recommendations about diaper care and the application of clotrimazole (Lotrimin) cream in the event of diaper rash. Giving yogurt with active cultures might also be helpful. </li>
    <li>Antibiotic administration in general, as well as for the management of acute otitis media (AOM), is frequently associated with the onset of diarrhea (occurring in up to 40% of patients). Although the diarrhea is usually self-limited, it can become more worrisome when associated with <em>Clostridium difficile</em>. </li>
    <li>Excessive use of azithromycin is associated with increasing rates of erythromycin resistance, particularly involving group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and therefore its routine use should be discouraged. Cefuroxime (Ceftin) can also be used, although it is clinically inferior to amoxicillin. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as cefdinir (Omnicef), are not more effective and carry with them an excessive risk of selection of resistant bacteria. </li>
    <li>Although some children will likely benefit from intramuscular ceftriaxone, the decision to prescribe this agent should not be made lightly, the overuse of ceftriaxone is likely to significantly increase high level penicillin resistance in this population. </li>
    <li>Placement of ventilation tubes is also associated with an increased risk of long-term tympanic membrane abnormalities and reduced hearing compared to medical therapy. </li>
