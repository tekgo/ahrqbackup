    <li>The Practice Committee recommends endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine needle aspiration (FNA) (when indicated), in conjunction with cross-sectional imaging, for the accurate staging of esophageal carcinoma (+++O). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee suggests that endoscopic mucosal dissection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) be used for the treatment and staging of nodular Barrett's esophagus (BE) and suspected intramucosal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (++OO). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee suggests that argon plasma coagulation (APC), heater probe, cryotherapy, or radiofrequency ablation not be used as monotherapy with curative intent for mucosal esophageal cancer (++OO). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee suggests that ablative techniques such as APC, heater probe, cryotherapy, or radiofrequency ablation may have a role in ablation of remaining high-risk tissue following resection (++OO). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends that esophageal stent placement is the preferred method for palliation of dysphagia and fistulae secondary to esophageal cancer because it provides immediate and durable relief in the majority of patients (+++O). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee suggests that a variety of factors, including patient preferences, quality of life, and prognosis be addressed with the patient and family before initiating endoscopic palliation for esophageal malignancy (++OO). </li>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Potential complications of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) are bleeding, perforation, and stricture formation. Delayed bleeding is rare, but immediate, postresection bleeding can occur in 10% of patients. Perforation rates are reported to be less than 3%. Rates of stricture formation vary depending on the circumference and length of mucosa removed by EMR, but can occur in up to 37% of cases. </li>
    <li>Complications of cryotherapy include chest pain, dysphagia, and, rarely, perforation. </li>
    <li>Stent complications include intolerable chest pain, perforation, migration, tumor ingrowth, bleeding, and fistula formation. </li>
    <li>In one study, rates of migration (11% vs 2%), tissue reaction, and bleeding were all higher in the self-expandable plastic stents (SEPS) group. Self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) were noted to have higher rates of tumor overgrowth, fistula formation, and food impaction. Airway compromise after SEMS placement for a tracheoesophageal fistula has been reported and careful evaluation of the patient with a multidisciplinary approach and concomitant airway management should be considered before the procedure. </li>
    <li>Tissue sampling contamination may occur when the endoscope traverses the tumor and it must be appreciated that false positive fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is possible when detached malignant cells that are present within the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen are picked up by the needle. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of this guideline. This guideline may be revised as necessary to account for changes in technology, new data, or other aspects of clinical practice. </li>
    <li>This guideline is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. This guideline is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment. Clinical decisions in any particular case involve a complex analysis of the patient's condition and available courses of action. Therefore, clinical considerations may lead an endoscopist to take a course of action that varies from these guidelines. </li>
