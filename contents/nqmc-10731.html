<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>At any given time, more than 100,000 residents in American nursing facilities have urethral catheters in place (Nursing Home Quality Initiative, 2004). Catheters are commonly used for urinary retention, wound management, and in some circumstances, patient comfort. When not properly maintained and monitored, indwelling catheters can cause chronic pain or infections leading to a greater functional decline and decreased quality of life for the resident (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2002) A thorough assessment of the resident and evaluation of the medical need for the catheter can sometimes decrease or prevent the use of catheters.</p>
<p>The indwelling catheter quality measure can potentially serve as a reminder to facilities of the importance of limiting catheter use (Brega et al., 2007). Overuse of catheters to manage incontinence, other than for short-term periods, is a potential sign of suboptimal care and an indication that further assessment and alternative treatment could be offered (Georgiou et al., 2001). Among nursing facility residents, there is evidence that institutional policies and educational programs strongly impact care provider practices. </p>
<p>There are clear benefits to nursing homes conducting a thorough evaluation of the medical need for the catheterization of their residents. A determination regarding continued use or removal should be completed as soon as possible following admission. Nursing facilities need to assess the frequency of urinary catheterization practices to ensure that policies reflect current practice standards, and increase compliance with Centers for Disease Control guidelines for prevention of infection related to catheter use (Nursing Home Quality Initiative, 2004). </p>
<p>Using Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 data for April to June 2008, the national prevalence of indwelling catheters in nursing facilities was 7.7%, with a range from an average of 5.2% in Rhode Island to a high of an average of 11.3% in North Dakota (CMS, n.d.) National measure results have been stable over time, ranging from 5.7% in 2003 to 5.8% in 2008 (American Health Care Association [AHCA], 2009). The current indwelling catheter quality measure is currently one of the 19 publicly reported quality measures for nursing facilities on the CMS Nursing Home Compare Web site. </p>
<p>Facilities can use information from this measure to determine whether they may be overusing catheters for their long stay residents. Reduced use of urinary catheters, and associated problems with catheter use including pain, infections and functional decline, are the expected benefits envisioned by use of this measure.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Indwelling urinary catheterization can frequently cause bacteremia, or in many cases, urinary tract infections, in the elderly. Catheterization causes bacteremia to occur at a rate of 3 to 10 percent of patients per day; a single in and out catheterization may cause bacteremia in as many as 20 percent of patients (Kamel, 2004). At least 40% of all infections seen in the nursing homes are in the urinary tract system; of those infections, 80% are due to urinary tract catheterization and instrumentation (Newman, Fader, &amp; Bliss, 2004). </li>
    <li>In a study to measure the quality of urinary continence care in long-term care facilities, catheterization rates were approximately 10% in nursing facilities, ranging from 0% to 44% among fourteen nursing homes where data was collected on the outcome measure (Georgiou et al., 2001). Thus, there was great variability in this quality measure within settings. The authors were cautious to note that interpretation of the outcome results required more precise details on case-mix and the definition of outcome measures. In another study looking at state variation in indicators of quality of care in nursing facilities, limited variation among states was observed for urinary catheterization. However, among the risk-adjusted quality scores, the authors observed the most variation for urinary catheterization (an approximately twofold difference) (Castle, Degenholtz, &amp; Engberg, 2005). </li>
    <li>Racial segregation between nursing facilities has been shown to be a major factor in racial disparities in the nursing facility population, primarily for African Americans. In 2000, a study drawing on national Minimum Data Set (MDS) and Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) data found that two-thirds of all black residents were living in just 10% of all facilities (Smith et al., 2007). A 2002 survey of a stratified sample of 39 nursing facilities and 181 residential care/assisted living facilities in four states had similar findings (Howard et al, 2002). Facilities serving African Americans have demonstrated a lower level of quality care than those serving whites with lower staff to resident ratios and higher deficiency ratings (Grabowski, 2004). Minority groups in general and African Americans in particular have also had more limited access to nursing facility care than whites (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1997) </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A joint RAND/Harvard team engaged in a deliberate iterative process to incorporate provider and consumer input, expert consultation, scientific advances in clinical knowledge about screening and assessment, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) experience, and intensive item development and testing by a national Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) consortium. This process allowed the final national testing of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 to include well-developed and tested items.</p>
<p>The national validation and evaluation of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (NHs) (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA NHs (764 residents), regionally distributed throughout the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze inter-rater agreement (reliability) between gold-standard (research) nurses and between facility and gold-standard nurses, validity of key sections, response rates for interview items, anonymous feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment.</p>
<p>Analysis of the test results showed that MDS 3.0 items had either excellent or very good reliability even when comparing research nurse to facility-nurse assessment. In most instances these were higher than those seen in the past with MDS 2.0. In addition, for the cognitive, mood and behavior items, national testing included collection of independent criterion or gold-standard measures. These MDS 3.0 sections were more highly matched to criterion measures than were MDS 2.0 items.</p>
<p>Improvements incorporated in MDS 3.0 produced a more efficient assessment: better quality information was obtained in less time. Such gains should improve identification of resident needs and enhance resident-focused care planning. In addition, including items recognized in other care settings is likely to enhance communication among providers. These significant gains reflect the cumulative effect of changes across the tool, including use of more valid items, direct inclusion of resident reports, improved clarity of retained items, deletion of poorly performing items, form redesign, and briefer assessment periods for clinical items.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>Risk adjustment refines raw quality measures (QM) scores to better reflect the prevalence of problems that facilities should be able to address. Two complementary approaches to risk adjustment are applied to the QMs.</p>
<p>One approach involves exclusion of residents whose outcomes are not under nursing facility control (e.g., outcome is evidenced on admission to the facility) or the outcome may be unavoidable (e.g., the resident has end-stage disease or is comatose). All of the QMs, except the vaccination QMs, are shaped by one or more exclusions. For each QM, the prevalence of the outcome across all residents in a nursing facility, after exclusions, is the <em>facility-level observed QM score</em>.</p>
<p>A second approach involves adjusting QM scores directly, using logistic regression. This method of adjustment employs<em> resident-level covariates</em> that are found to increase the risks of an outcome.
