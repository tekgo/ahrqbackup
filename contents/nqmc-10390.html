Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of admissions for a principal diagnosis of gastroenteritis, or for a principal diagnosis of dehydration with a secondary diagnosis of gastroenteritis, per 100,000 population, ages 3 months through 17 years. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Gastroenteritis is a leading infectious disease of childhood acute infections and leading cause of hospitalization. Many cases of gastroenteritis can be prevented by vaccination with the rotavirus vaccine and through hygienic practices. Most cases of mild to moderate gastroenteritis can be treated in the outpatient arena. Early treatment focuses on oral rehydration.</p>
<p>Access to outpatient care may prevent illness through improved education about prevention, improved vaccination rates, and early access to treatment and/or treatment advice. Clinical practice guidelines suggest that prevention of gastroenteritis is preventable; and hence, hospitalizations for gastroenteritis are preventable.</p>
<p>This measure is an avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) type indicator. ACSC type indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of potentially avoidable hospitalization if appropriate outpatient care, other healthcare services or community services were accessed and obtained (i.e., measures of the health care system broadly defined). These measures are designed to assess population access to timely, high quality outpatient and public health services in a particular geographic area, for the purpose of managing chronic disease or diagnosing acute illnesses before progressing to inpatient treatment. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), accountable care organizations (ACOs) or public health agencies. ACSC indicators correlate with each other and they may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a national, regional or county level.</p>
<p>The improvement in the measure equates to less hospitalizations for acute gastroenteritis. This essentially means the population is experiencing better management of acute gastroenteritis given the reduction in the complications related to gastroenteritis. </p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Approximately 1 in every 50 children born each year (less than 18 years of age) in a developed nation, such as the United States (U.S.), is hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis sometime during childhood. Viral gastroenteritis accounts for approximately 3% to 5% of all hospital days and 7% to 10% percent of hospitalizations each year for children younger than 18 years (Glass et al., 2001; Vel&aacute;zquez et al., 1996). More than 95% of viral gastroenteritis hospitalizations occur in children younger than 5 years with the highest rate of illness occurring in children between 3 and 24 months of age (Newburg et al., 1998; Vel&aacute;zquez et al., 1996). Among children younger than 5 years, the average rate of illness ranges from one to five episodes per child-year, resulting in a total of 15 to 25 million episodes of acute gastroenteritis per year in the U.S. (Matson &amp; Estes, 1990; Tucker et al., 1998; Ho et al., 1998). Approximately 3 to 5 million of these episodes result in clinician visits, and 200,000 in hospitalization. Following the reintroduction of rotavirus immunization in 2006, norovirus (a calicivirus) has become the leading cause of gastroenteritis among young children in the U.S. Before rotavirus immunization, approximately one-half of hospitalizations for acute, nonbacterial gastroenteritis in children in the U.S. were caused by rotavirus, and 5% to 15% each by caliciviruses, astroviruses, and enteric adenoviruses. The remaining one-fourth to one-third of cases cannot be linked to any of these pathogens, but probably represent under diagnosis of the common pathogens (Staat et al., 2002; Oh, Gaedicke, &amp; Schrieier, 2003). Many hospitalizations can be prevented by use of oral rehydration therapy in the community. Oral rehydration solution is regard as many as one of the most important medical advances of the 20th century (Chow, Leung, &amp; Hon, 2010). However, despite overwhelming evidence to support the usage of oral rehydration therapy, it is under used (Chow, Leung, &amp; Hon, 2010). Data from Europe, Australia and Canada show that 80% to 94% of hospitalized children do not have any signs of dehydration and yet they still received intravenous therapy. </p>
<p>An original study from New York on gastroenteritis reported a 1.87-fold variation in gastroenteritis hospitalization rates for ages 0 to 64, with a coefficient of variation of 0.438 and 22% of variance explained by household income (Billings et al., n.d.). Another study reported that low-income zip codes had 1.9 times more pediatric gastroenteritis hospitalizations per capita than high-income zip codes in the same 11 states in 1988 (Millman, 1993). Similarly, a retrospective analysis of the 1995 to 1996 cohort of infants born in Western Australia showed that aboriginal infants were hospitalized for gastroenteritis 8 times more frequently, and readmitted 2.7 times more frequently than their non-Aboriginal peers (Gracey, Lee, &amp; Yau, 2004). These findings suggest that this indicator may be marker for poor access to outpatient care.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The developer's metric of reliability is the signal to noise ratio, which is the ratio of the between area variance (signal) to the within area variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). There is an area-specific signal to noise ratio, which is used as an empirical Bayes univariate shrinkage estimator. The overall signal to noise ratio is a weighted average of the area-specific signal-to-noise ratio, where the weight is [1 / (signal + noise)^2]. The signal is calculated using an iterative method. The analysis reports the reliability of the risk-adjusted rate (before applying the empirical Bayes univirate shrinkage estimator).</p>
<p>Overall the risk-adjusted rate is strongly reliable. Based on a norm of a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.80, 80% of areas exceed the norm. Reliability is less than the norm in areas with population less than approximately 1,600 persons, meaning that the performance score is reliability adjusted closer to the shrinkage target in those areas.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p>The developer conducted construct validity testing to examine the association between the risk-adjusted rate and area structural characteristics potentially associated with quality of care, including prior performance, using regression analysis.</p>
<p>Given the stated rationale, the expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "Less Access to High Quality Outpatient Care" construct validity measure (F1) and the area risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "More Market Competition" construct validity measure (F2) and the area risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The results are consistent with expectations. Also, past performance is a strong predictor of current performance with a coefficient of 0.91.</p>
