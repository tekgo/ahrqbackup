<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is good evidence that metformin alone vs. placebo increases the ovulation rate in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to suggest that metformin alone increases pregnancy rates or live-birth rates compared with placebo. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does Metformin Alone as First-line Ovulation Induction Therapy Improve Clinical Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates Compared with Clomiphene Citrate (CC)?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence from one large, well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) that metformin alone is less effective than CC alone for the achievement of ovulation induction, clinical pregnancy, and live birth in women with PCOS. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does Metformin Alone as First-line Ovulation Induction Therapy Improve Clinical Pregnancy and Live-birth Rates Compared with Letrozole Alone?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to suggest that metformin alone increases pregnancy or live-birth rates compared with letrozole alone. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>However, there is fair evidence based on one well-designed trial in support of letrozole for ovulation induction (<strong>Grade B</strong>). Therefore, letrozole is a reasonable first-line agent for ovulation induction in PCOS patients. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When Used in Combination with Other Agents as First-line Therapy for Ovulation Induction in Women with PCOS, Does Metformin Increase Pregnancy Rates and Live-birth Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is good evidence that metformin in combination with CC improves ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates but does not improve live-birth rates compared with CC alone in women with PCOS. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is fair evidence from one RCT that pretreatment with metformin for at least 3 months followed by the addition of another ovulation-inducing drug increases live-birth rate. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does the Combination of Metformin and CC or Other Ovulation Induction Agents Improve Ovulation, Clinical Pregnancy Rate, or Live-birth Rate in the Subset of CC-resistant Patients with PCOS?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>CC-Metformin Versus CC Alone</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is fair evidence that CC-metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates compared with CC alone in CC-resistant PCOS women (<strong>Grade B</strong>). However, more studies are needed to determine whether there may be subgroups of women (e.g., specific body mass index [BMI], ethnicity, absence of insulin resistance, etc.) with PCOS and CC resistance for which CC-metformin provides the most benefit over CC alone. </p>
<p><strong>Metformin Versus Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling (LOD)</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is fair evidence that overall pregnancy rates are not different with CC-metformin, CC-LOD, or LOD alone in women with CC‒resistant PCOS. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence regarding pregnancy rate or live-birth rate with the use of metformin alone compared with LOD for ovulation induction in CC‒resistant PCOS patients. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CC-Metformin Versus Aromatase Inhibitors</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to compare metformin plus CC to aromatase inhibitors alone or metformin plus aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction in CC‒resistant women. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>CC-Metformin Versus Gonadotropins</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient or conflicting evidence regarding metformin use combined with CC compared with gonadotropins for ovulation induction in women with CC‒resistant PCOS. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does Pre-pregnancy Use of Metformin Reduce the Risk of Miscarriage in Non-assisted Reproductive Technology (Non-ART) Pregnancies?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is fair evidence that metformin used while attempting pregnancy and stopped at the initiation of pregnancy does not affect the rate of miscarriage. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend metformin during pregnancy to reduce the chance of miscarriage. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does Metformin Affect the Likelihood of Multiple Pregnancies?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Summary Statements</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is good evidence that metformin alone does not increase the rate of multiple pregnancy. (<strong>Grade A</strong>) </li>
    <li>While there is no evidence of an effect (either increase or decrease) on multiple pregnancy rates in cycles using combination CC plus metformin vs. CC alone, there remains insufficient data on this matter due to lack of adequate power to detect a difference. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence of a reduced risk for multiple pregnancy with the addition of metformin to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) compared with FSH alone. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Is Metformin More Effective in Lean or Obese PCOS Patients?</strong></span></p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span>
<p><em>Summary Statement</em></p>
<p>There is insufficient good-quality evidence to determine if metformin is more effective in non-obese or obese women with PCOS. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>Metformin alone should not be used as first-line therapy for ovulation induction in women with PCOS, since ovulation induction agents such as CC or letrozole are more effective. CC alone or letrozole alone are reasonable first-line agents for ovulation in women with PCOS. Combination therapy with CC may be beneficial in women who are resistant to CC alone. While metformin alone is not likely to increase live-birth rate in women seeking pregnancy in the short term, utilizing metformin in individualized cases of PCOS with the goal of improving ovulation rates over the long term may be of benefit. In the context of increased ovulation rate and overall improved insulin resistance on metformin, the subsequent addition of other ovulation-inducing agents may be beneficial in increasing pregnancy rates, although there is insufficient evidence of an increase in live-birth rates. These data suggest that individualization of treatment may be warranted, particularly in younger women with PCOS. Additional large, adequately powered randomized trials are needed in carefully defined populations of women with various forms of PCOS (i.e., phenotype specified) to determine in whom the use of metformin may be of benefit.</p>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This clinical practice guideline was based on a systematic review of the literature performed in the electronic database MEDLINE through PubMed on December 7, 2016. No limit or filter was used for time period covered or language, but articles were subsequently culled for English language.</p>
<p>A combination of the following medical subject headings or text words were used: aromatase inhibitors, clomiphene, dexamethasone, diathermy, diathermy/methods, female, fertility agents, follicle aspiration, follicle puncture, follicle stimulating hormone/therapeutic use, glucocorticoids, gonadotropin releasing hormone/therapeutic use, gonadotropins/ therapeutic use, insulin sensitizer, intrauterine insemination, in vitro maturation, in vitro oocyte maturation techniques, IUI, IVM, laser therapy/methods, laser therapy/therapeutic use, letrozole, Leventhal, metformin, ovarian drilling, ovulation induction/adverse effects, ovulation induction/methods, PCO, PCOD, polycystic ovar$, polycystic ovarian syndrome/ drug therapy, polycystic ovary syndrome/drug therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, Stein-Leventhal. </p>
<p>Initially, titles and abstracts of potentially relevant articles were screened and reviewed to develop inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Only studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed in the final analysis. Studies were eligible if they met one of the following criteria: primary evidence (clinical trials) that assessed the effectiveness of a procedure correlated with an outcome measure (pregnancy, ovulation, or live-birth rates); meta-analyses; and relevant articles from bibliographies of identified articles. </p>
<p>Four members of an independent task force reviewed the full articles of all citations that potentially matched the predefined selection criteria. Final inclusion or exclusion decisions were made on examination of the articles in full. Disagreements about inclusion among reviewers were discussed and resolved by consensus or arbitration after consultation with an independent reviewer/epidemiologist.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Beginning in the 1990s, a series of studies involving relatively small numbers of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), many uncontrolled and some controlled, indicated that metformin reduced insulin resistance in women with PCOS and increased the likelihood of ovulation and pregnancy without, or sometimes with, clomiphene citrate. </li>
    <li>While metformin alone is not likely to increase live-birth rate in women seeking pregnancy in the short term, utilizing metformin in individualized cases of PCOS with the goal of improving ovulation rates over the long term may be of benefit. </li>
    <li>In the context of increased ovulation rate and overall improved insulin resistance on metformin, the subsequent addition of other ovulation-inducing agents may be beneficial in increasing pregnancy rates, although there is insufficient evidence of an increase in live-birth rates. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the original guideline document for details about potential benefits of specific interventions.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Therapy with metformin does not lead to weight gain and may be associated with modest weight loss, largely because of a slight anorectic effect as well as gastrointestinal side effects, including abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Importantly, metformin may be associated with the development of lactic acidosis, but almost all patients who develop acidosis have impaired renal function, and the incidence is rare when the drug is used appropriately.</p>
