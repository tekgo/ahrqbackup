<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world and in the United States (U.S.). COPD defines a group of diseases characterized by airflow obstruction, and includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema (Mannino et al., 2002). Symptoms of COPD range from chronic cough and sputum production to severe, disabling shortness of breath, leading to significant impairment of quality of life. COPD afflicts nearly 16 million adults in the U.S. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S., and is projected to move to third place by 2020 (Snow et al., 2001; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI], 2001).</p>
<p>Spirometry is a simple test that measures the amount of air a person can breathe out and the amount of time it takes to do so (NHLBI &amp; World Health Organization [WHO], 2004). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients suspected of COPD should have spirometry performed to establish airway limitation and severity (Sutherland &amp; Cherniack, 2004). Though several scientific guidelines and specialty societies (American Thoracic Society, 1994; NHLBI &amp; WHO, 2004; Institute for Clinical Systems [ICSI], 2003; Veterans Administration/Department of Defense [VA/DoD], 2001) recommend use of spirometry testing to confirm COPD diagnosis and determine severity of airflow limitation, spirometry tests are largely underutilized.</p></div>
