Description

<div class='FieldValue'>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Infection in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants increases risk of mortality, length of hospital stay, and cost of care. Additionally, neonatal infections among extremely low birth weight infants are associated with poor neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes in early childhood (Stoll et al., 2004). While early-onset sepsis rates have been reduced by advances in obstetric care, late-onset sepsis rates have increased with improved survival of preterm infants (Dong &amp; Speer, 2015), and risk for late sepsis increases with decreased birth weight and gestational age (Stoll et al., 2002). The American Academy of Pediatrics outlined strategies to prevent late-onset infections (Polin et al., 2012), including hand hygiene, following Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) guidelines for prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections (O'Grady et al., 2011), and adapting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pneumonia prevention guidelines (Tablan et al., 2004) to be used for ventilated neonatal intensive care (NICU) patients. </p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Late sepsis or meningitis in very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates is a measure of nosocomial bacterial infection for eligible infants whose birth weight is between 401 and 1500 grams or whose gestational age is between 22 and 29 weeks. Coefficients from the Vermont Oxford Network are provided on request to hospitals that wish to determine observed and expected values based on case mix for a given period (usually a year). The observed and expected values may be used to calculate hospital performance measures such as the standardized morbidity ratio, the standardized rate, or observed minus expected values. The coefficients are based on a multivariable logistic regression model which includes birth location and factors present at birth that may be associated with infection.</p>
<p>A measure of systematic variation among hospitals in the Vermont Oxford Network is also available on request to provide a means to adjust for random variation using a process referred to as shrinkage. Shrinkage formulas are described in the original measure documentation in the section labeled 'Calculation Instructions.' When the shrinkage formulas are applied, the hospital performance measure values move closer to the population mean in proportion to the imprecision of the estimate, i.e., in inverse proportion to the number of cases. Shrunken estimates are a weighted average of the hospital value and the population (Vermont Oxford Network) mean value. In small hospitals shrunken estimates will weight the population mean value more heavily, whereas the calculated performance measure value will be weighted more heavily in larger hospitals. Shrunken estimates are more stable over time than if the correction were not applied, because they adjust for imprecision by filtering random variation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Measure Stratification</span>: Covariates associated with predicting the expected value are included in the multivariable model.</p>
<p>The covariates include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Gestational age in completed weeks (GA) </li>
    <li>GA squared </li>
    <li>Small for gestational age </li>
