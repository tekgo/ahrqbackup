<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Lower respiratory infection (LRIs), consisting of bronchiolitis, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), are among the most common reasons for pediatric hospitalization. Bronchiolitis and CAP are also 2 of the 10 admission diagnoses with the highest readmission prevalence in children (Berry et al., 2013). Hospitalizations for LRI-related care impose significant clinical, social, and financial burdens upon patients and families. Reducing LRI readmissions could alleviate these burdens and reduce health care costs.</p>
<p>Readmissions disrupt the lives of patients and families, expose patients to risks of harm during hospitalization, and are costly. The number of children who experience readmissions is substantial. Overall, readmissions within 30 days occur for 2% to 6% of pediatric hospitalizations (Berry et al., 2013; Jencks, Williams, &amp; Coleman, 2009; Wick et al., 2011; Jiang &amp; Wier, 2010). Thirty-day readmissions occur for 3.7% to 4.5% of pediatric bronchiolitis hospitalizations and 4.5% of pediatric pneumonia hospitalizations (Berry et al., 2013; Kemper et al., 2005). Because LRIs are such a common reason for hospitalization, the absolute number of readmissions following LRI hospitalizations is high. Readmissions signal the quality of disease management, indicating a worsening of health status that in some cases may have been prevented. They also reflect the quality of key processes, including discharge planning and education, care transitions, and follow-up care. Disparities in pediatric readmission rates exist based on race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and special health care needs. For example, children with pre-existing neurologic conditions are more likely to develop influenza complications and are at a higher risk for readmission following hospitalization for influenza (Bhat et al., 2005).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Prevalence of Lower Respiratory Infection (LRI) </strong></p>
<p>Bronchiolitis, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population. Annually, bronchiolitis affects 26 in 1,000 children 0 to 2 years old (Pelletier, Mansbach, &amp; Camargo, 2006; Mansbach, Emond, &amp; Camargo, 2005). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of bronchiolitis, infects nearly 90% of children during the first 2 years of life, 40% of whom develop bronchiolitis (American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Diagnosis and Management of Bronchiolitis, 2006). Influenza attack rates are highest in children and range from 15% to 70% annually (Carr, 2012). Influenza most commonly affects children 5 to 18 years old (Carr, 2012). During the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic alone, 20 million children acquired the infection (Chang et al., 2012). The prevalence of pediatric CAP decreases with age. A study using 2006 data from children's and nonchildren's hospitals estimated that 912 in 100,000 children less than 1 year old acquired CAP. The corresponding rates for children 1 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 18 years old were 390/100,000, 84/100,000, and 62/100,000, respectively (Lee et al., 2010). </p>
<p><strong>LRI Hospitalization and Readmission Rates Vary by Age</strong> </p>
<p>The prevalence of LRI-related hospitalizations and readmissions varies significantly by age. Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants (Pelletier, Mansbach, &amp; Camargo, 2006). Influenza hospitalization rates are highest for children less than 6 months old (Carr, 2012). The rate of pneumonia hospitalization is highest in children less than 2 years old, at 1,000 hospitalizations per 100,00 children, and decreases with age (Griffin et al., 2013). The relationship of age to bronchiolitis or influenza readmission risk has not yet been reported. Readmissions for pneumonia are most prevalent in older children. One study found that readmission rates following pneumonia hospitalizations were 1.9% for children 12 to 18 years old, 1.2% in children 1 to 5 years old, and 0.9% in children 6 to 11 years old (p&lt;0.001) (Weiss et al., 2011). Another study found a similar age-associated trend in pediatric pneumonia readmission rates (Brogan et al., 2012). </p>
<p><strong>Social and Clinical Burdens of LRI and LRI Readmission </strong></p>
<p>Hospitalization of a child is disruptive to families. It can affect parent/caregiver work and sibling school or daycare arrangements and expose families to various psychosocial stressors (Shudy et al., 2006; Rennick et al., 2002). Infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, for example, are commonly discharged prior to full recovery. As a result, parents must take time off from work, keep their child out of day care, and schedule additional medical visits (Robbins et al., 2006). Readmission also exposes patients to additional hospital days and thus increased potential for further infections and medical errors, which are common during hospitalization (Aspden et al., 2007; Kohn, Corrigan &amp; Donaldson, 2000).</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal Burden of LRI and LRI Readmission </strong></p>
<p>LRIs and LRI readmissions among pediatric patients are costly. The average cost of bronchiolitis-associated hospitalizations is $9,063 per child (Willson et al., 2003). Furthermore, the development of chronic complications from bronchiolitis, such as asthma, poses a significant long-term financial burden (American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Diagnosis and Management of Bronchiolitis, 2006). The total estimated annual cost of pediatric influenza is $1.67 billion, with costs of approximately $55 million per hospital annually (Molinari et al., 2007; Ampofo et al., 2006). Costs of influenza hospitalization to patients and families are also substantial and include direct costs of medical care as well as indirect costs such as school absenteeism and parental work loss (Weycker et al., 2005). The average cost of hospitalization for CAP (for children and adults) is $12,000 per patient (Paladino et al., 2007). </p>
<p><strong>Association of Readmission with Children's Future Health </strong></p>
<p>Frequent hospitalization may have negative developmental effects, including anxiety and feelings of isolation, particularly for children who are chronically ill and return to school after prolonged hospitalizations (Worchel-Prevatt et al., 1998). Frequently-hospitalized adolescents are more likely to drop out of school than their healthy peers (Weitzman et al., 1982; Kearney, 2008). School reintegration can be complicated by side effects caused by treatment or the illness itself or by increased social, emotional, and behavioral problems (Shaw &amp; McCabe, 2008). </p>
<p><strong>Potential for LRI Quality Improvement </strong></p>
<p>Studies have shown hospital-level variation in pediatric readmission rates for LRI, suggesting there is potential for improvement in the quality of LRI care. One study found significant variation among children's hospitals in 3-day pediatric bronchiolitis readmission rates, which ranged from 0% to 2.7% (p&lt;0.001) (Christakis et al., 2005). Another study of children's hospitals found significant variation in risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for admission diagnoses of bronchiolitis and pneumonia (Berry et al., 2013). Effective interventions to reduce LRI readmissions have been demonstrated (Cheney et al., 2005; Pillai et al., 2011; Dean et al., 2006). For bronchiolitis, for example, implementation of a clinical pathway with management and discharge criteria significantly reduced 14-day readmission rates (Cheney et al., 2005). For pneumonia, improvements during hospitalization in use of recommended antibiotics, communication of discharge information to patients, and use of electronic medical records have reduced readmission rates (Schmeida &amp; Savrin, 2012; Jones, Friedberg, &amp; Schneider, 2011). Unplanned readmissions following hospitalization for LRI care are commonly for complications of the original disease. Interventions aimed at preventing these complications when possible, or better managing them when they occur, could potentially reduce readmissions. The most common complications for bronchiolitis are asthma and other chronic respiratory problems (Willson et al., 2003; Bacharier et al., 2012). Neurologic conditions are increasingly frequent complications of influenza (Bhat et al., 2005; Effler, 2012; Keren et al., 2005). Local complications of pneumonia, such as empyema, lung abscess, and necrotizing pneumonia, are becoming more prevalent, particularly in younger children (Keren et al., 2005; Grijalva et al., 2010).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability </strong></p>
<p>The measure was developed and tested using multiple claims datasets. These included 2008 Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data for 26 states, which include Medicaid claims from children's and non-children's hospitals; 2005 to 2009 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) revisit data for New York and Nebraska, which include claims for all payers from children's and non-children's hospitals; July 2009 to June 2010 National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions (NACHRI) case-mix data, which include claims for all payers from 72 acute care children's hospitals in 34 states; and the 2009 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), which includes claims for all payers from children's and non-children's hospitals in 44 states. For the MAX and AHRQ revisit datasets, the developer chose which states' data to use based on assessment of data quality and completeness. All of the datasets except the KID can be used to evaluate readmissions (although the NACHRI Case-mix data only allow identification of readmissions back to the same hospital); the KID provides other useful information about pediatric hospitalizations, such as frequencies of specific conditions and procedures, and can be weighted to produce national estimates.</p>
<p>The reliability of hospital-level readmission rates was evaluated using the formula shown in the supplemental materials (refer to the original measure documentation for additional information). Reliability values range from 0 to 1. If perfect information from a very large sample were available for a hospital, so the hospital's random effect could be determined with perfect precision, then the reliability of that hospital's readmission rate would approach 1. If no information were available for a hospital, then the reliability of that hospital's readmission rate would be 0. </p>
<p>Using the 26-state MAX dataset, it was determined that for hospitals with at least 25 pediatric lower respiratory infection (LRI) admissions annually, the median reliability for hospital-level LRI readmission rates was 0.46 (interquartile range 0.35 to 0.61). Reliability was greater than 0.5 for hospitals with at least 76 index admissions annually. Seventy-three percent (73%) of index hospitalizations occurred at hospitals whose readmission rate reliability was at least 0.5, while 41% of index hospitalizations occurred at hospitals whose readmission rate reliability was at least 0.7.</p>
<p>Use of hospital random effects in the case-mix adjustment model adjusts the readmission rate estimate toward the mean rate for the entire cohort of hospitals, more so for hospitals with low volume and correspondingly low readmission rate reliability (because for a hospital with little available data, estimation of the hospital's rate relies more on assumptions about the distribution of hospital rates than for a hospital with a large amount of data). As a result, a hospital that has a high or low unadjusted readmission rate but insufficient volume to estimate its readmission rate precisely is prevented from appearing to be an outlier when it might not be.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong> </p>
<p>The validity of the measure's case-mix adjustment model was evaluated by assessing the discriminative ability of the model using the concordance (c-) statistic (Austin &amp; Steyerberg, 2012; Steyerberg et al., 2010). Discrimination refers to how well the model distinguishes between subjects with and without the outcome (in this case, readmission) (Austin &amp; Steyerberg, 2012). The c-statistic is a unitless measure of the probability that a randomly selected subject who experienced readmission will have a higher predicted probability of having been readmitted than a randomly selected subject who did not experience readmission (Austin &amp; Steyerberg, 2012). The c-statistic for the case-mix adjustment model, when applied to the 26-state MAX dataset, was 0.71, which is very much in range with results for other 30-day readmission models (Yale New Haven Hospital Services Corporation [YNHHSC] Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation [CORE], "Hospital-wide," 2012; YNHHSC CORE, "Hospital-level," 2012; YNHHSC CORE, 2013; Rice-Townsend et al., 2013). </p></div>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Readmissions for planned procedures and for chemotherapy are part of a patient's intended course of care and thus unlikely to be related to health system quality. This measure therefore focuses on unplanned readmissions because they are more likely to be related to a defect in quality of care during the index admission or during the interval between the index admission and readmission. In adult and pediatric medicine, most planned readmissions are for planned procedures or chemotherapy; therefore, these exclusions are intended to capture the majority of planned admissions. </li>
    <li><em>Planned Procedure</em>: A procedure that was judged by expert reviewers to generally be scheduled at least 24 hours in advance for an expected medical need in more than 80% of cases and to be a potential reason for hospitalization (see Data Dictionary for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] procedure codes). </li>
    <li><em>Planned Readmission</em>: An admission to an acute care hospital with a primary ICD-9 or principal ICD-10 procedure code for a planned procedure, occurring within 30 days of discharge from a prior acute care hospitalization. </li>
