Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Physician" section of the Inpatient Survey.</p>

<p>The "Physician" section is one of ten sections that comprise the <a href="/browse/DisplayOrganization.aspx?org_id=16&doc=371#data">Inpatient Survey</a>. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ol>
<li><p>Patient satisfaction is both an <em>indicator</em> of quality of care, and a <em>component</em> of quality care.</p>

<p>In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that</p>

<blockquote>
"...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them.  This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] <u>Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care</u>, Health Administration Press). 
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a <em>component</em> of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).</p>

<p>Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).</p>

<li><p>In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction</li>
<li>Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)</li></ul>
</li></ol>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Inpatient Survey was first developed in 1987.  In 1997, it was revised to ensure that it continued to accurately reflect patients' experiences and provide useful data to our clients.  The 49-question survey was fully tested in 1997 and has a robust factor structure and high subscale reliability.  However, the environment for measuring patient perceptions has changed.  Not all of these questions continue to be vital to understanding patient views, and hospitals have additional needs for incorporating standardized measurement such as HCAHPS within their patient survey.</p>

<p>Press Ganey tested shorter sets of standard questions that produced section and overall scores similar to the full Press Ganey survey.  Press Ganey has evaluated its full survey to determine which questions could be removed and still provide a full quality improvement tool.  As a result of these analyses, eleven questions were removed from the standard question set to take effect in early 2007.  Questions were removed after individual consideration if they were found to be non-universal, to not reflect the current structure of the health care experience, to be highly correlated with another item and/or to have a lower factor loading than the other questions in the same section.</p>

<p>Effective questionnaires have three important attributes: focus, brevity, and clarity.  Questions should focus directly on a specific issue or topic, be as brief as possible while still conveying the intended meaning, and be expressed as simply and as clearly as possible.  The original 49 questions met these criteria and their face, content, and consensus validities were established in the original development work and all subsequent re-validations that ensured that the instrument remained accurate over time.</p>

<p>The remaining 38 questions were tested using our standard mail-out/mail-back methodology to eliminate selection and acquiescence biases.</p>

<p>The validation of the 38-item Inpatient tool is described in the "Inpatient Survey Psychometrics" document.  The analyses were based on 565,557 surveys returned to Press Ganey during the first quarter of 2005, representing 1,436 hospitals.</p>

<p>Results stemming from the test of the reduced Inpatient Survey showed robust scale that consisted of ten internally consistent subscales: Admission, Room, Meals, Nurses, Test and Treatments, Visitors and Family, Physician, Discharge, Personal Issues, and Overall Assessment.</p>

<p>Refer to the "Inpatient Survey Psychometrics" document for further details.</p></div>
