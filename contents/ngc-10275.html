<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that all patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malignancy should be referred to centres that have developed expertise in the management of these diseases (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that clinical networks supporting regional centres of excellence for the treatment of both acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining and non-AIDS-defining cancers should be developed as advocated by the <a href="http://www.bhiva.org/documents/Standards-of-care/BHIVAStandardsA4.pdf" title="BHIVA Web site">Standards of Care for People Living with HIV 2013</a> (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kaposi Sarcoma (KS)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary of Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that KS should be confirmed histologically (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that computerized tomography (CT) scans, bronchoscopy and endoscopy are not warranted in the absence of symptoms (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) should be started in all patients diagnosed with KS (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests local radiotherapy or intralesional vinblastine for symptomatic or cosmetic improvement in early stage T0 KS (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that patients with T1 advanced stage KS should receive chemotherapy along with HAART (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that liposomal anthracyclines (either DaunoXome 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q14d or Caelyx 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q21d) are first-line chemotherapy for advanced KS (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends paclitaxel chemotherapy (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q14d) for second-line treatment of anthracycline refractory KS (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>All patients should be considered for clinical trial enrolment if eligible (<strong>GPP</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systemic AIDS-Related Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (ARL)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that all patients have pathology and treatment plans reviewed by a specialist multidisciplinary team (MDT) and that management is co-ordinated closely with an HIV physician and a haemato-oncologist familiar with the treatment of such patients (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Management</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations for Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that patients should be entered into clinical trials, if available (<strong>GPP</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that first-line treatment of DLBCL in HIV-positive individuals includes chemotherapy regimens used in HIV-negative patients, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (CHOP) or infusional therapies such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and hydroxydaunorubicin (EPOCH). No randomized studies have been published in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and hence there is no optimal 'gold-standard therapy' (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that chemotherapy regimens should be combined with HAART therapy (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends the concomitant administration of rituximab (<strong>1B</strong>). Patients with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts &lt;50 cells/&mu;L may require closer surveillance (<strong>GPP</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Burkitt Lymphoma/Leukaemia (BL)</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations for BL</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that first-line treatment of BL in HIV-infected individuals includes regimens such as cyclophosphamide, vincristine (also called Oncovin), doxorubicin, methotrexate/ifosfamide, mesna, etoposide (also called VP-16), cytarabine (also called Ara-C) (CODOX-M/IVAC) and dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and hydroxydaunorubicin (DA-EPOCH). No comparative studies have been performed and hence there is no optimal 'gold standard therapy' (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that chemotherapy regimens should be combined with HAART therapy (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends the addition of rituximab (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prevention of Secondary Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations for Intrathecal (IT) Prophylaxis</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that patients with DLBCL, considered to have a high risk of CNS relapse, should be given CNS prophylaxis (IT and/or intravenous [IV] methotrexate) according to the same criteria as HIV-negative patients (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that prophylactic IT chemotherapy should be offered to all patients with Burkitt lymphoma (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory AIDS-Related Lymphoma (ARL)</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations for Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Aggressive ARL</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that patients deemed fit for intensive chemotherapy should receive a second-line chemotherapy regimen (<strong>1C</strong>), which may contain platinum (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that those patients responding to second line chemotherapy (complete remission [CR] or partial remission [PR]) should be considered for high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that all patients with PCNSL should be started on HAART if not already on it (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that patients with an adequate performance status should be treated, if possible, with high dose methotrexate-containing chemotherapy regimen (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that whole brain radiotherapy is a useful palliative treatment modality for control of symptoms or should be considered as an alternative first-line treatment modality in those patients where the risks of toxicity from high-dose intravenous agents are considered unacceptable (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that first-line treatment of PEL in HIV-infected individuals includes CHOP-like regimens. No comparative studies have been performed and there is no optimal gold-standard therapy (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients, where possible, should be entered into clinical trials that are testing novel targeted approaches (<strong>GPP</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that chemotherapy regimens should be combined with HAART (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plasmablastic Lymphoma</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that patients should receive HAART with systemic anthracycline-containing chemotherapy as first-line therapy (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) and Cervical Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that all women newly diagnosed with HIV should have cervical surveillance performed by, or in conjunction with, the medical team managing their HIV infection (<strong>1B</strong>). An initial colposcopy and annual cytology should be performed if resources permit (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that subsequent colposcopy for cytological abnormality should follow United Kingdom (UK) national guidelines, and the age range screened should be the same as for HIV-negative women (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that CIN 2/3 (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL]) should be managed according to UK national guidelines. Lesions less severe than CIN 2 should probably not be treated according to CIN 2/3 recommendations, as these low-grade lesions represent persistent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection of the cervix rather than pre-malignancy (<strong>2B</strong>). Women with HIV and CIN 2/3 treated by excisional procedures have a significantly higher treatment failure rate than HIV-negative women. A number of studies show such relapse is less frequent in the presence of HAART or higher CD4 cell counts or undetectable viral load. Multidisciplinary management of such women is thus recommended (<strong>GPP</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that women with HIV who have invasive cervical cancer should be managed in the same way as HIV-negative women according to UK national guidelines, again within a multidisciplinary team framework (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anal Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary of Guidance</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends the examination under anesthetic (EUA) of the anal canal and rectum with biopsy in all suspected cases (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that staging for anal cancer following EUA and biopsy includes CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis in order to assess regional lymph nodes and tumor extension (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that the management of HIV patients with anal cancer is in specialized centres where there is MDT experience in order to ensure optimal outcomes (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that centres caring for these patients should be able to provide high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) services (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that all people living with HIV who are to be treated with CRT should start HAART (<strong>1C</strong>) and opportunistic infection prophylaxis (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that salvage surgery may be appropriate for people living with HIV who experience loco-regional disease persistence or relapse following CRT (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that best supportive care may be more appropriate for patients with metastatic disease or local relapse following salvage surgery (<strong>2D</strong>). The Writing Group suggests a similar approach in people living with HIV (<strong>2D</strong>) and advocate surveillance for anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) by HRA (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Is the Best Treatment for HL?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends for early-favourable HL: doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) x2&ndash;4 + involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) 20&ndash;30 Gy (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends for early-unfavourable HL: ABVD x4 + IFRT 30 Gy (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends for advanced-stage HL: ABVD x6&ndash;8 +/&minus; RT (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Is the Benefit of Adding Antiretrovirals (ARVs) to Chemotherapy in HL?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends patients should receive HAART during chemotherapy (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends to avoid protease inhibitor (PI)/ritonavir-boosted regimens (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Is the Best Treatment in Second Line for HL?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that fit patients with relapsed/refractory HL should receive salvage chemotherapy and, if the disease proves to be chemosensitive, consolidate the response with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue (HDT/ASCR) (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Is the Benefit of Adding Opportunistic Infection Prophylaxis in HL?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP), <em>Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare</em> (MAC) and fungal infection prophylaxis (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Is the Best Response Evaluation and Follow-Up in HL?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends assessment of response after treatment should be performed by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan and bone marrow (BM) biopsy (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends assessment during follow-up should be performed every 2 to 4 months during the first 2 years and every 3 to 6 months for 3 further years (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>People living with HIV and Hodgkin lymphoma who require blood products should receive irradiated products in line with the national guidelines, as should patients who are candidates for stem-cell transplantation (<strong>GPP</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multicentric Castleman's Disease (MCD)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that histological confirmation requires immunocytochemical staining for human herpes virus-8 (HHV8) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) lambda (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that all patients should have their blood levels of HHV8 measured to support the diagnosis (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that the risk of lymphoma in patients diagnosed with MCD is high (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) does not prevent MCD (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that a rise in plasma HHV8 level can predict relapse (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that rituximab should be first-line treatment for MCD (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that chemotherapy should be added to rituximab for patients with aggressive disease (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends re-treatment with rituximab-based therapy for relapsed MCD (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests clinical monitoring for patients in remission should include measurement of blood HHV8 levels (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-AIDS-Defining Malignancies (NADM)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Testicular Germ Cell Cancers</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<p>Seminoma of the testis is more common in men living with HIV infection.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group suggests germ cell tumours of the testis should be treated in an identical manner regardless of HIV status (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests men living with HIV who require chemotherapy for germ cell tumours should receive concomitant HAART and opportunistic infection prophylaxis (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests surveillance for stage I disease is safe (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests bleomycin can be avoided if necessary in the management of these patients (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSMLC)</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends HIV-positive patients should be encouraged to stop smoking cigarettes (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests patients should be offered potentially curative surgery where appropriate (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests patients should be screened for activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by a team experienced in the use of HAART (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests there is currently no role for screening for lung cancer in people living with HIV (<strong>GPP</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC)</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that people living with HIV with HCC should be treated in a similar manner to their HIV-negative counterparts (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that liver transplantation should be considered for appropriate cases, as in the HIV-negative population (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that sorafenib is a treatment option in advanced, nonoperable HCC (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
    <li>Noncirrhotic hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfected patients should be considered for HCC screening (<strong>GPP</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends HCC screening with liver ultrasound (<strong>1A</strong>) and suggest 6-monthly alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (<strong>2C</strong>) be offered to all cirrhotic patients with HBV and HCV confections. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Cancers</strong></p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that the management of people living with HIV with non-AIDS-defining malignancy should be in a centre with adequate experience and requires a joint MDT including both oncologists with experience of managing HIV-related malignancy and HIV physicians (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that patients with NADM should be offered the standard care given to HIV-negative patients (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that all potential interactions between HAART, opportunistic infection prophylaxis and cancer therapy should be considered (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunistic Infection Prophylaxis in HIV-Associated Malignancy</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that all patients with AIDS-defining malignancies should start HAART (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group suggests that all patients with NADM who are due to start chemotherapy or radiotherapy should be started on HAART unless contraindicated (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that prophylaxis against PCP should be started for those who have a CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/&mu;L (<strong>1A</strong>) and should be considered at higher levels in all patients starting chemotherapy or radiotherapy (<strong>GPP</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends prophylaxis against MAC for individuals with a CD4 cell count less than 50 cells/&mu;L (<strong>1B</strong>) and in those whose treatment puts their CD4 count at risk of falling below this level. </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that systemic azole antifungal prophylaxis should be used in all patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy for HIV-associated malignancy (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group does not recommend routine fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in low-risk patients and the use of cotrimoxazole to prevent PCP may provide some protection against bacterial infection for patients living with HIV (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends herpes simplex virus (HSV) prophylaxis in people living with HIV with a history of HSV infection who are starting chemotherapy to reduce the incidence and severity of reactivations (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends annual influenza vaccination (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends vaccination against pneumococcus and HBV (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Writing Group recommends that patients with antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) should be treated with prophylactic antivirals in line with British HIV Association (BHIVA) hepatitis guidelines (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grade A evidence</strong> means high-quality evidence that comes from consistent results from well- performed randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or overwhelming evidence from another source (such as well-executed observational studies with consistent strong effects and exclusion of all potential sources of bias). Grade A implies confidence that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Grade B evidence</strong> means moderate-quality evidence from randomised trials that suffers from serious flaws in conduct, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecise estimates, reporting bias, or some combination of these limitations, or from other study designs with specific strengths such as observational studies with consistent effects and exclusion of the majority of the potential sources of bias.</p>
<p><strong>Grade C evidence</strong> is low-quality evidence from controlled trials with several serious limitations, or observational studies with limited evidence on effects and exclusion of most potential sources of bias.</p>
<p><strong>Grade D evidence</strong> is based only on case studies, expert judgement or observational studies with inconsistent effects and a potential for substantial bias, such that there can be little confidence in the effect estimate.</p>

<p><strong>Good Practice Points (GPP)</strong> are recommendations based on the clinical judgment and experience of the working group. GPPs emphasise an area of important clinical practice for which there is not, nor is there likely to be, any significant research evidence. They address an aspect of treatment and care that is regarded as such sound clinical practice that health care professionals are unlikely to question it and where the alternative recommendation is deemed unacceptable. It must be emphasised that GPPs are not an alternative to evidence-based recommendations.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grade A evidence </strong>means high-quality evidence that comes from consistent results from well-performed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or overwhelming evidence of some other sort (such as well-executed observational studies with consistent strong effects and exclusion of all potential sources of bias). Grade A implies confidence that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Grade B evidence</strong> means moderate-quality evidence from randomized trials that suffer from serious flaws in conduct, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecise estimates, reporting bias, or some combination of these limitations, or from other study designs with special strengths such as observational studies with consistent effects and exclusion of most potential sources of bias.</p>
<p><strong>Grade C evidence</strong> means low-quality evidence from controlled trials with several very serious limitations or observational studies with limited evidence on effects and exclusion of most potential sources of bias.</p>
<p><strong>Grade D evidence</strong> on the other hand is based only on case studies, expert judgement or observational studies with inconsistent effects and a potential for substantial bias, such that there is likely to be little confidence in the effect estimate.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>For each topic and healthcare question, evidence was identified and evaluated by Writing Group members with expertise in the field. Using the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document), panel members were responsible for assessing and grading the quality of evidence for predefined outcomes across studies and developing and grading the strength of recommendations. An important aspect of evaluating evidence is an understanding of the design and analysis of clinical trials, including the use of surrogate marker data. For a number of questions, GRADE evidence profile and summary of findings tables were constructed.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The British HIV Association (BHIVA) revised and updated the Association's guideline development manual in 2011. BHIVA has adopted the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for the assessment, evaluation and grading of evidence and development of recommendations. Full details of the guideline development process, including conflict of interest policy, are outlined in the manual.</p>
<p>The scope, purpose and guideline topics were agreed by the Writing Group. Questions concerning each guideline topic were drafted and a systematic literature review undertaken by an information scientist. For a number of questions, GRADE evidence profile and summary of findings tables were constructed, using predefined and rated treatment outcomes, to help achieve consensus for key recommendations and aid transparency of the process.</p>
<p><strong>Patient Involvement</strong></p>
<p>British HIV Association (BHIVA) views the involvement of patient and community representatives in the guideline development process as essential. The Writing Group included two patient representatives appointed through the UK HIV Community Advisory Board (UK-CAB) who were involved in all aspects of the guideline development process. In addition, two meetings with patients and community representatives were held to discuss and receive feedback and comments on the proposed guideline recommendations. The first was held before the Writing Group's consensus meeting and the second as part of the public consultation process.</p></div>

<p><strong>Good Practice Points (GPP)</strong> are recommendations based on the clinical judgment and experience of the working group. GPPs emphasise an area of important clinical practice for which there is not, nor is there likely to be, any significant research evidence. They address an aspect of treatment and care that is regarded as such sound clinical practice that health care professionals are unlikely to question it and where the alternative recommendation is deemed unacceptable. It must be emphasised that GPPs are not an alternative to evidence-based recommendations.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>False-positive and false-negative results of imaging and screening tests </li>
    <li>Toxicity and adverse effects of chemotherapy. Many antiretrovirals have overlapping toxicities with chemotherapeutic agents. </li>
    <li>Radiotherapy did not improve either overall survival or quality of life compared to supportive care alone. Higher numbers of fractions of radiotherapy appear to offer only minor benefits and are more costly as well as being less convenient for patients. </li>
    <li>Radiotherapy side effects in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been reported as more severe, although a recent review of head and neck cancer patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy did not show any significant increase in toxicity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive compared to HIV-negative patients </li>
    <li>Initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may precipitate a paradoxical worsening of symptoms, termed the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Opportunistic infections are the most common manifestation, although sudden progression of existing Kaposi sarcoma (KS) or development of new lesions may also occur. </li>
    <li>Although 30-day post-operative mortality is comparable to that in the general population, there is an increase in complications and recurrence, whilst overall survival is reduced. </li>
    <li>Use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) requires caution due to potential interaction with HAART through induction of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. Data from KS suggest that TKIs do indeed potentiate the side effects of HAART. </li>
    <li>KS exacerbation was the most challenging adverse event after rituximab therapy. </li>
    <li>In one study, an increased death rate from infectious complications, particularly (9/15) in those with a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell count below 50 cells/&mu;L, was observed in those on rituximab. </li>
    <li>The most common grade 3&ndash;4 toxicities of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) are haematological, gastrointestinal and skin and some series have found that these are more common in patients with lower CD4 cell counts although this is not a universal finding. </li>
    <li>Itraconazole use for prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP) was associated with significantly more adverse events causing discontinuation of the drug. Itraconazole and posaconazole also interact with vinca alkaloids so should be avoided in regimens containing vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine or vinorelbine. Voriconazole use may be associated with severe photosensitivity and other adverse events and also has adverse interactions with vinca alkaloid chemotherapy. </li>
