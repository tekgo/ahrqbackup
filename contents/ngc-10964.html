    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, who are at nutritional risk, or exhibiting challenging mealtime behaviors, or not meeting energy intake goals, behavioral therapy provided by knowledgeable team members should accompany nutritional therapy. (<strong>Grade: A; Certainty: High; Benefit: Substantial</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="49">
    <li>The CF Foundation recommends that all providers be aware of the presenting symptoms of the following gastrointestinal tract disorders: constipation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, small bowel overgrowth, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, and celiac disease. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, the CF Foundation recommends that children and their parents be questioned regarding abdominal pain at each visit, and that pain is investigated if persistent or recurrent. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, and who are pancreatic sufficient (PS), the CF Foundation recommends that children are reevaluated annually for the conversion to PI with fecal elastase measurement, particularly if genetic testing reveals 2 mutations potentially associated with PI. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, and who are PS with severe abdominal pain, particularly if associated with vomiting, the CF Foundation recommends measurement of lipase and amylase to determine if pancreatitis is present. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>
    <li>For children with CF, ages 2 through 5 years, who had terminal ileal bowel resection, the CF Foundation recommends annual measurement of serum vitamin B12 concentration. (<strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>) </li>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In January 2014, the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation convened a committee of 16 CF pediatric experts and parents to develop clinical care guidelines for preschool-aged children with CF. Committee members participated in 1 of 3 workgroups. Each group developed population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions, which were reviewed and approved by the wider committee. </p>
<p>In May 2014 the committee convened to review draft recommendation statements and supporting evidence. Unfortunately, the evidence is lacking for most treatments and monitoring tools in the 2- to 5-year-old age group. Whenever possible, statements were developed and graded by using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force grade definitions (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). The committee decided to make recommendations for CF care that would guide both CF clinicians and primary care providers (PCPs). Therefore, questions for which evidence was limited or absent were then presented and discussed by committee members. Use of existing evidence from older children and adults, as well as clinical experience, was then used as the basis for consensus recommendations. An 80% approval by the committee was agreed on a priori, and required for all statements.</p></div>
