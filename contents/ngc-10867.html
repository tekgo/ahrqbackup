<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;" start="1">
    <li>The perioperative RN administering moderate sedation/analgesia must practice within the scope of nursing practice as defined by his or her state board of nursing and should comply with state advisory opinions, declaratory rules, and other regulations that direct the practice of the registered nurse. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should perform and document a patient nursing assessment before administering moderate sedation/analgesia. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN administering moderate sedation/analgesia should continuously care for the patient throughout the procedure. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should know the recommended dose, recommended dilution, onset, duration, effects, potential adverse reactions, drug compatibility, and contraindications for each medication used during moderate sedation (see Guideline for medication safety. In: <em>Guidelines for Perioperative Practice</em>. Denver [CO]: AORN; 2015. pp. 291-334). </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should evaluate the patient for discharge readiness based on specific discharge criteria. </li>
    <li>The health care organization should provide the perioperative RN with initial and ongoing education and competency verification on his or her understanding of the principles and performance of the skills related to nursing care of the patient receiving moderate sedation/analgesia. </li>
    <li>The health care organization's interdisciplinary team should develop moderate sedation/analgesia policies and procedures based on the state's medical and nurse practice acts, regulatory requirements, practice guidelines, professional organizations' statements, and accreditation requirements. </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should participate in quality assurance and performance improvement activities that are consistent with the health care organization's plan to improve understanding of and compliance with the principles and skills of moderate sedation/analgesia administration. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted systematic searches of the databases MEDLINE&reg;, CINAHL&reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in April 2013 and November 2014, and limited results to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized and nonrandomized trials and studies, reviews, and guidelines. The librarian also conducted a non-systematic search of the Scopus&reg; database. The searches were limited to literature published in English between 2006 and November 2014. At the time of the initial searches, the librarian established weekly alerts on the search topics and until April 2015, presented relevant alert results to the lead author.</p>
<p>During the development of this guideline, the lead author requested supplementary literature searches and additional literature that either did not fit the original search criteria or was discovered during the evidence-appraisal process. Finally, the lead author and the medical librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies, professional organizations, and standards-setting bodies.</p>
<p>Although the lead author's original search request encompassed both moderate sedation and local anesthesia, only literature relevant to the care of patients receiving moderate sedation/analgesia was considered for inclusion in this document. Search terms included <em>conscious sedation, anti-anxiety agents, flumazenil, naloxone, propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, drug hypersensitivity, risk assessment, sleep apnea syndromes, continuous positive airway pressure, modified Mallampati test, thyromental distance test, bispectral index, airway management,</em> and <em>patient discharge</em>. Other key words were included to address the concepts of patient assessment, sedation scales, risk factors, patient monitoring, and tools and methods for predicting difficult mask ventilation. The complete search strategies are available upon request.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, relevance to the key questions, and publication dates within the time restriction unless none was available.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and literature that examined local anesthesia, local monitored anesthesia care, general anesthesia, regional anesthesia (e.g., spinal, epidural), total intravenous anesthesia, minimal sedation, deep sedation, endotracheal intubation, laryngoscopy, awake intubation, dental office procedures, fospropofol, etomidate, propofol administration in the emergency room and intensive care unit, sedation for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients, palliative care, premedication for general anesthesia, pain management following discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and proceduralist techniques. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher quality evidence was available, and literature outside the time restriction was excluded when literature within the time restriction was available.</p></div>
