<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inpatient Management Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>It is recommended that a thorough history and examination be completed to establish an impairment based physical therapy (PT) diagnosis and individualized plan of care (American Physical Therapy Association [APTA], 2001 [5b]). </li>
    <li>It is recommended that transfer training and evaluation for medical equipment be performed for the patient referred to inpatient PT post-soft tissue release and application of a Petrie cast (Local Consensus [5]).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Patient will be discharged from inpatient PT post-soft tissue release and Petrie cast application when patient and family are independent and safe with transfers (Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    </li>
    <li>It is recommended that the patient is referred to inpatient PT post-soft tissue release and removal of the Petrie cast, but prior to bony surgery to restore hip, knee, and ankle range of motion (ROM) and to maximize joint mobility to allow for adequate ROM for ease of surgical intervention (Local Consensus [5]). </li>
    <li>It is recommended that the following are assessed at initial evaluation and at discharge from inpatient PT post soft tissue release and removal of the Petrie cast:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Pain using the Oucher Pain Scale (Beyer et al., 2005 [4a]) or Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (Williamson &amp; Hoggart, 2005 [1b]; von Baeyer et al., 2009 [4b]) </li>
        <li>Qualitative skin integrity assessment (Local Consensus [5]) </li>
        <li>Lower extremity passive range of motion (LE PROM) </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: LE PROM assessment to include:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Hip flexion </li>
        <li>Hip extension to no further than 0&deg; </li>
        <li>Hip adduction </li>
        <li>Hip abduction </li>
        <li>Hip internal rotation (IR) with hip flexed to 90&deg; </li>
        <li>Hip external rotation (ER) with hip flexed to 90&deg; </li>
        <li>Knee flexion </li>
        <li>Knee extension </li>
        <li>Ankle dorsiflexion </li>
        <li>Ankle plantarflexion </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: A fluid filled goniometer is to be used to measure ROM (Rao &amp; Joseph, 2001 [4b]). However, use of a linear goniometer is also acceptable (Rao &amp; Joseph, 2001 [4b]; Clapper &amp; Wolf, 1988 [4b]; Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>It is recommended that the goals for inpatient PT post-soft tissue release and Petrie cast removal but prior to bony surgery include:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Hip flexion to 120&deg; </li>
        <li>Maximize hip abduction, hip IR, and hip ER ROM </li>
        <li>Hip extension to no further than 0&deg; </li>
        <li>Knee flexion to 120&deg; </li>
        <li>Maximize ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion </li>
        <li>Maximize integrity of the skin </li>
        <li>Minimize pain </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Local Consensus [5]). </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li>It is recommended that the following treatment interventions be utilized for impairments found during initial assessment:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Pain management
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Warm whirlpool (Local Consensus [5]), cryotherapy, or hot pack based on patient preference (Nadler, Weingand, &amp; Kruse, 2004 [5a]) </li>
            <li>Gentle PROM (Local Consensus [5]) </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Improving ROM
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Gentle passive static stretching for LE musculature (Moseley et al., 2005 [2a]; Bandy, Irion, &amp; Briggler, 1998 [2a]; Davis et al., 2005 [2b]) </li>
            <li>Warm whirlpool (Local Consensus [5]) or hot pack for muscle relaxation and pain management with stretching (Taylor, Waring, &amp; Brashear, 1995 [2b]; Nadler, Weingand, &amp; Kruse, 2004 [5a]) </li>
            <li>Perform active range of motion (AROM) and active assistive range of motion (AAROM) following passive stretching to maintain newly gained ROM (Depino, Webright, &amp; Arnold, 2000 [2b]) </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Improving skin integrity
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>A warm whirlpool may be utilized to promote improved skin integrity (Local Consensus [5]). </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="7">
    <li>It is recommended that patients are discharged from inpatient PT post-soft tissue release and removal of the bony cast when the bony surgical procedure is performed (Local Consensus [5]).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Transfer training and evaluation for medical equipment following the bony surgery and application of the hip spica cast may be completed if needed (Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outpatient Management Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Assessment</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="8">
    <li>It is recommended that patients begin post-operative PT following bony surgery one week after removal of the cast (Local Consensus [5]).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Individuals who participate in supervised clinic visits demonstrate greater improvement in muscle strength, functional mobility, gait speed, and quality of exercise performance than those who receive a home exercise program (HEP) alone or no instruction at all (Friedrich, Cermak, &amp; Maderbacher, 1996 [2b]). Individuals who receive regular positive feedback from PT are more likely to be compliant with a supplemental HEP (Sluijs, Kok, &amp; van der Zee,&nbsp;1993 [4b]).</p>
    </li>
    <li>It is recommended that a second thorough history and examination be completed to establish an outpatient impairment based PT diagnosis and individualized plan of care (APTA, 2001 [5b]).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Obtaining a pertinent history includes communication with the referring physician regarding the surgical procedure, associated precautions, and physician preferences (Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    </li>
    <li>It is recommended that the following are assessed at the initial evaluation, on a monthly basis or more frequently if the patient demonstrates a change in status, and at discharge:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Pain and symptoms </li>
        <li>LE PROM and AAROM and/or AROM </li>
        <li>LE strength </li>
        <li>Gait </li>
        <li>Balance </li>
        <li>Patient reported outcome measures </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pain and Symptoms</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="11">
    <li>It is recommended that pain is assessed at each visit using the Oucher Pain Scale (Beyer et al., 2005 [4a]) or NRS (Williamson &amp; Hoggart, 2005 [1b]; von Baeyer et al., 2009 [4b]). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lower Extremity PROM and AROM</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="12">
    <li>It is recommended that a fluid filled goniometer be used to measure ROM (Rao &amp; Joseph, 2001 [4b]).
    <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Hip ROM to assess includes hip flexion, abduction, extension, IR, and ER.</p>
    <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Use of a linear goniometer is also acceptable (Rao &amp; Joseph, 2001 [4b]; Clapper &amp; Wolf, 1988 [4b]; Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    </li>
    <li>It is recommended that knee and ankle ROM be assessed at the initial evaluation and thereafter, as needed based on limitations (Local Consensus [5]). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lower Extremity Strength</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="14">
    <li>It is recommended that quantitative muscle testing is performed using a hand held dynamometer (Gajdosik, 2005 [4b]; Escolar et al., 2001 [4b]).
    <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Muscle groups to assess include hip flexors, hip abductors, hip extensors, hip internal rotators, hip external rotators, knee extensors, knee flexors, and any other muscle group that is significantly limited (Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: The hand held dynamometer has been found to have high intra- and inter-rater reliability with quantitative muscle testing (Gajdosik, 2005 [4b]; Escolar et al., 2001 [4b]).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Gait/Functional Mobility</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="15">
    <li>It is recommended that functional mobility and gait be qualitatively assessed following post-operative weight bearing (WB) precautions (Local Consensus [5]).
    <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Commonly observed gait characteristics seen in children with Legg-Calve-Perthes (LCP) when WB on the involved LE include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Increased hip adduction on stance leg (Westhoff et al., 2006 [4b]) </li>
        <li>Trunk lean outside the normal range (Westhoff et al., 2006 [4b]) </li>
        <li>Trendelenburg (Westhoff et al., 2006 [4b]) (hip drop on unaffected limb while in swing) </li>
        <li>Compensated Trendelenburg/reverse Trendelenburg/Duchenne (Westhoff et al., 2006 [4b]) (trunk lean to the affected side while in stance on the affected limb) </li>
        <li>Toe in or toe out (Yoo et al., 2008 [4b]) </li>
        <li>Decreased hip extension during stance (Westhoff et al., 2012 [4b]) </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Commonly observed gait characteristics seen in children following removal of a hip spica cast include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Increased dorsiflexion </li>
        <li>Increased hip and knee flexion </li>
        <li>Compensated Trendelenburg </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Wong et al., 2004 [2b]).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="16">
    <li>It recommended that the gold standard for gait analysis of 3-D kinematics and kinetics (Toro, Nester, &amp; Farren, 2003 [1b]) not be used in the clinic due to limited accessibility and feasibility (Local Consensus [5]).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: There is insufficient evidence and lack of reliability and validity (Toro, Nester, &amp; Farren, 2003 [1b]) to support use of these observational gait assessment tools with this population (Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="17">
    <li>It is recommended that balance is assessed in patients 7 years old or older using the Pediatric Balance Scale (Franjoine et al., 2010 [4b]) as WB status allows (Local Consensus [5]).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Balance is assessed using single leg (SL) stance on the involved side compared to the uninvolved side if:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The patient is younger than 7 years old </li>
        <li>The patient is unable to follow commands </li>
        <li>The test is unavailable </li>
        <li>Time does not permit its use </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Outcome Measure Scores</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="18">
    <li>It is recommended that the age appropriate Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 (PedsQL) (Varni, Seid, &amp; Kurtin, 2001 [4a]) Physical Functioning section is administered at the initial evaluation, on a monthly basis, and at discharge for reassessment of patient's reported functional status (Local Consensus [5]).
    <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: The Parent Report for Toddlers is administered for children 2 to 4 years old (Varni, Limbers, &amp; Burwinkle, "How young can children", 2007 [4a]).</p>
    <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: The Young Child Self Report is administered for children 5 to 7 years old (Varni, Limbers, &amp; Burwinkle, "How young can children", 2007 [4a]).</p>
    <p><strong>Note 3</strong>: The Child Self Report is administered for children 8 to12 years old (Varni, Limbers, &amp; Burwinkle, "How young can children", 2007 [4a]).</p>
    <p><strong>Note 4</strong>: For patients 5 to 12 years old unable to conceptually understand the questionnaire tool, it is acceptable for the parent to complete the parent proxy form for the young child (5 to 7 years old) or child (8 to 12 years old) (Varni, Limbers, &amp; Burwinkle, "Parent proxy-report", 2007 [4a]).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Physical Therapy Interventions</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="19">
    <li>It is recommended that supervised PT is supplemented with a customized written HEP (Friedrich, Cermak, Maderbacher, 1996 [2b]) in all phases of rehabilitation (Local Consensus [5]). </li>
    <li>It is recommended that the PT engage in ongoing communication with the patient, family, and referring physician regarding the disease process and plan of care (Local Consensus [5]). </li>
    <li>It is recommended that advancement through the phases of rehabilitation follow both a goal based and time based progression, due to the nature of the surgical procedure and disease process (Local Consensus [5]).
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Treatment is to focus on containment of the femoral head in the acetabulum throughout the disease process (Wenger, Ward, &amp; Herring,&nbsp;1991 [5a]; Leach, 2006 [5b]) and each phase of rehabilitation (Local Consensus [5]).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phases Of Rehabilitation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Initial Phase (0 to 2 weeks post-cast removal)</strong></p>

An elevation of the pelvis combined with trunk lean towards the stance limb, hip abduction, and hip ER unloads the hip joint (Svehlik et al., 2012 [4b]).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The recommendations contained in this guideline were formulated by an interdisciplinary working group which performed systematic search and critical appraisal of the literature, using the Table of Evidence Levels described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field, and examined current local clinical practices.</p>
<p>Recommendations have been formulated by a consensus process directed by best evidence, patient and family preference and clinical expertise. During formulation of these recommendations, the team members have remained cognizant of controversies and disagreements over the management of these patients. They have tried to resolve controversial issues by consensus where possible and, when not possible, to offer optional approaches to care in the form of information that includes best supporting evidence of efficacy for alternative choices.</p></div>

Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The desired outcome of treatment of children with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCP) is to contain the femoral head in the acetabulum to maximize a spherical shape of the femoral head for good joint congruency </li>
    <li>Consistency in delivery of physical therapy (PT) services for post-operative management of patients with LCP to promote and optimize range of motion (ROM), strength, and joint preservation, minimize impairments, maximize function and improve patient and family satisfaction </li>
