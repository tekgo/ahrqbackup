Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess hospital-level, risk-adjusted rates of inpatient admissions or emergency department (ED) visits for cancer patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age for at least one of the following ten diagnoses&mdash;anemia, dehydration, diarrhea, emesis, fever, nausea, neutropenia, pain, pneumonia, or sepsis&mdash;within 30 days of hospital-based outpatient chemotherapy treatment. Rates of admission and ED visits are calculated and reported separately.</p>
<p>This measure will be publically reported in both the Outpatient Quality Reporting Program and Prospective Payment System-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting (PCHQR) program. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Chemotherapy treatment can have severe, predictable side effects, which, if inappropriately managed, can reduce patients' quality of life and increase healthcare utilization and costs. This measure aims to assess the care provided to cancer patients and encourage quality improvement efforts to reduce the number of potentially avoidable inpatient admissions and emergency department (ED) visits among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in a hospital outpatient setting. Improved management of these potentially preventable clinical conditions that are frequent side effects of chemotherapy treatment&mdash;including anemia, dehydration, diarrhea, emesis, fever, nausea, neutropenia, pain, pneumonia, or sepsis&mdash;could reduce admissions and ED visits and increase patients' quality of care and quality of life (Hassett et al., 2006; Fitch &amp; Pyenson, 2010; Guillory &amp; Sockdale, 2013). This measure encourages hospitals to use guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Oncology Nursing Society, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and other professional societies to integrate and promote use of evidence-based interventions to prevent and treat common side effects and complications of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>This risk-standardized measure seeks to increase transparency in the quality of care cancer patients receive and to provide information to help physicians and hospitals mitigate patients' need for acute care, which can be a burden on patients, and increase patients' quality of life.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cancer care is a priority area for outcomes measurement because cancer is an increasingly prevalent condition associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and healthcare spending. In 2015, there were more than 1.6 million new cases of cancer in the United States (American Cancer Society, 2015). Each year, approximately 22 percent of patients with cancer receive chemotherapy (Klodziej et al., 2011). Unscheduled emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions are significant sources of utilization and cost among this population; on average, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy have one hospital admission and two ED visits per year. Approximately 40 percent of those admissions and 50 percent of those ED visits stem from complications of chemotherapy (Klodziej et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>Recent studies of cancer outpatients show that the most commonly cited symptoms and reasons for hospital visits are pain, anemia, fatigue, nausea and/or vomiting, fever and/or febrile neutropenia, shortness of breath, dehydration, diarrhea, and anxiety/depression (Hassett et al., 2006). These predictable complications affect patients' quality of life and pose a heavy financial burden; using commercial claims data, Fitch and Pyenson (2010) reported that the national average cost of a chemotherapy-related admission was $22,000, and the average cost of a chemotherapy-related ED visit was $800. In addition, Medicare payments for cancer treatment totaled $34.4 billion in 2011, representing almost 10 percent of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) spending (Guillory &amp; Sockdale, 2013). </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) tested the measure using the National Quality Forum (NQF) criteria for scientific soundness and importance, including testing the risk-adjustment model, assessing sociodemographic status (SDS) risk factors, and evaluating the measure score variation in development and validation split samples. The measure testing aligns with national guidelines for publicly reported outcomes measures and with the technical approach to outcomes measurement set forth in NQF guidance for outcomes measures (2011), CMS Measure Management System (MMS) guidance (2016), and the guidance in the American Heart Association scientific statement "Standards for Statistical Models Used for Public Reporting of Health Outcomes" (Krumholz et al., 2006). The model showed good fit and discrimination across risk groups and the two hospital types (Prospective Payment System-exempt cancer hospital [PCH] and non-PCH). For summarizing the results from testing, CMS calculated each risk-adjustment model (for hospital visits and emergency department [ED] visits) among all hospitals, and presented overall and stratified results by hospital type (PCH and non-PCH). During testing, CMS estimated the measure score for hospitals using Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims with a performance period of July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2013, and calculated results for all hospitals, PCHs, and non-PCHs. Across all hospital types, the risk-standardized inpatient admission rate (RSAR) ranged from 6.0 to 24.9 percent. The risk-standardized ED visit rate (RSEDR) ranged from 2.1 to 7.5 percent.</p></div>

    <li>The chemotherapy measure is a risk-adjusted outcome measure and does not have a traditional numerator like a process measure; thus the developer uses this field to define the outcomes of interest as this measure separately reports hospital rates of two outcomes: admission and ED visits. The qualifying diagnosis on the admission or ED visit claim must be (1) the principal diagnosis or (2) a secondary diagnosis accompanied by a principal diagnosis of cancer. Outcomes are identified separately for the inpatient and ED categories; a patient can only qualify for an outcome in either category, but not both. Patients who experience both an inpatient admission and an ED visit during the performance period are counted towards the inpatient admission outcome. Among those with no qualifying inpatient admissions, qualifying ED visits will be counted. </li>
    <li>The measure calculates a hospital-specific risk-adjusted rate for each of the two outcomes. Each rate is calculated as the ratio of a hospital's "predicted" number of outcomes to "expected" number of outcomes multiplied by the national observed outcome rate. If a hospital's ratio of predicted to expected outcomes is less than 1, it indicates that the hospital is performing better than expected given its case mix. If a hospital's ratio of predicted to expected outcomes is greater than 1, it indicates that the hospital is performing worse than expected given its case mix. For ease of interpretation, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services transforms this ratio to a rate by multiplying by the national observed rate for that outcome. If the "predicted" number of outcomes is higher (or lower) than the "expected" number of outcomes for a given hospital, the risk-adjusted rate will be higher (or lower) than the national observed admission rate.

<div class="content_para"><p>Since the measure has two mutually exclusive outcomes&mdash;qualifying inpatient admissions and qualifying emergency department (ED) visits&mdash;it has two risk-adjustment models, one for each dependent variable (inpatient admissions and ED visits). A two-level hierarchical logistic regression model is used to estimate risk-standardized outcome rates. This approach accounts for differences in patient mix, the clustering of patients within hospitals, and variation in sample size. </p>
<p>The measure adjusts for variables that are clinically relevant and associated with the outcome. It seeks to adjust for differences in patient demographics, clinical comorbidities, and treatment exposure (that is, the number of chemotherapy treatments undergone by the patient in the hospital outpatient setting during the performance period), which vary across patient populations and influence the outcome but do not relate to quality. Specifically, the risk-adjustment model for inpatient admissions has 20 patient-level variables (age, sex, exposure, nine comorbidity variables, and eight cancer categories). The risk-adjustment model for ED visits has 15 patient-level variables (age, sex, exposure, six comorbidity variables, and six cancer categories).</p>
