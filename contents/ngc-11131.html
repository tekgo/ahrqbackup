<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN)</strong>: The original guideline document provides guidance to assist perioperative nurses in documenting and managing patient care information within the perioperative practice setting. Highly reliable data collection is not only necessary to chronicle the patient&rsquo;s response to nursing interventions, but also to demonstrate the health care organization&rsquo;s progress toward improving health care outcomes. Health care data collection and retention is rapidly transitioning from traditional paper formats to standardized electronic applications that incorporate criteria from statutes and regulations, accreditation requirements, and standards-setting bodies. Whether patient data are captured using paper or electronic formats, the nursing process should be completed for each surgical or procedural intervention performed.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>As part of the legal health record, the perioperative patient health care record should reflect the plan of care, including assessment, nursing diagnosis, outcome identification, planning, implementation of interventions, and evaluation of progress toward the expected outcome ("Standards," 2015; "ANA principles," 2010; "Nursing: scope," 2010; Peterson, 2013). </li>
    <li>Perioperative nursing documentation should be synchronized with the nursing workflow (Whittenburg, 2010; Lee &amp; McElmurry, 2010; Better EHR, 2014; Colligan et al., 2015). </li>
    <li>Electronic perioperative nursing documentation should use the Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS) and other structured vocabularies inclusive of the nursing process workflow with discrete representation of each phase of the perioperative patient care continuum (i.e., preadmission, preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative) (Hayrinen, Lammintakanen, &amp; Saranto, 2010; Kim et al., 2009; Lundberg et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>Perioperative nursing documentation should be structured to meet professional and regulatory compliance requirements for a comprehensive representation of patient care (42 CFR &sect;416.47, 2007; 42 CFR &sect;482, 2011; 42 CFR &sect;482.24, 2011; 42 CFR &sect;482.23, 2011; 42 CFR &sect;416.46, 2007). </li>
    <li>Patient information must be secure, held confidential, and protected from unauthorized disclosure (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 1996). </li>
    <li>Modifications to existing content in the patient health care record should comply with federal and state regulations, health care accreditation requirements, and national practice guidelines ("ANA principles," 2010; Foundation of Research and Education of AHIMA, 2005). </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should receive initial and ongoing education and competency verification on their understanding of the principles and performance of the processes for documenting patient care and of best practices for maintaining the security of patient care information ("ANA principles," 2010; Medical records, 2008; Bredfeldt et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for perioperative information management should be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting. As new evidence emerges, policies and procedures should evolve to accommodate best practices and technology developments (Clark et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>A quality management program should be developed and implemented, and should focus on the integrity of the data within the patient health care record (Clark et al., 2013). </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic search of the databases MEDLINE&reg;, CINAHL&reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The librarian also conducted a non-systematic search of the Scopus&reg; database. Results were limited to literature published in English from January 2011 to June 2015. During the development of the guideline, the lead author requested additional articles that either did not fit the original search criteria or were discovered during the evidence appraisal process, and the lead author and the medical librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies. At the time of the initial search, the librarian established weekly alerts on the search topics and until October 2015, presented relevant alert results to the lead author.</p>
<p>Search terms included the subject headings and keywords <em>medical informatics, nursing informatics, documentation, information management, medical records, electronic health records, computerized patient records, information storage and retrieval, forms and records control, computer-assisted decision making, operating room information systems, hospital information systems, health information exchange, clinical decision support systems, interoperability, systems integration, data mining,</em> and <em>informed consent</em>. The concepts of standardized terminologies were included with a broad subject-heading controlled vocabulary as well as individual headings and keywords for relevant standardized terminologies. Subject headings and keywords related to government regulations included <em>government regulation, meaningful use, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Affordable Care Act,</em> and <em>Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Care Record</em>. The keywords <em>big data, electronic signature, charting by exception, variance charting, electronic medical record, EHR, Health Level Seven International, HL7,</em> and <em>EMR</em> also were included in the search, as were terms related to the concepts of data collection, retention, storage, and governance.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, and relevance to the key questions.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and evidence from other disciplines when evidence from the perioperative setting was available. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher quality evidence was available, and literature outside the time restriction was excluded when literature within the time restriction was available.</p></div>

    <li>No attempt has been made to gain consensus among users, manufacturers, and consumers of any material or product. </li>
    <li>Compliance with the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) guideline is voluntary. </li>

    practice, variations in practice settings and clinical situations may
    limit the degree to which each recommendation can be implemented. </li>
    <li>AORN recognizes the many diverse settings in which perioperative nurses practice; therefore, this guideline is adaptable to all areas where operative or other invasive procedures may be performed</li>
