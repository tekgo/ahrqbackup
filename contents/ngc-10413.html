<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Work-relatedness usually involves direct or indirect trauma to the shoulder, or prolonged, awkward, or overhead arm use. </li>
    <li>Differential shoulder diagnosis is typically based on clinical criteria. Fracture or dislocation are important to rule in; however, diagnostic precision for soft tissue conditions may not yield many differences in conservative manual care options as treatment typically involves passive and active interventions for the entire shoulder girdle. </li>
    <li>Rapid functional improvement gains should be evident with conservative care, particularly with severely restricted shoulder range of motion. Baseline and progress functional tracking instruments should be routinely used. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work-Related Mechanical Shoulder Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Work-related shoulder conditions of mechanical origin for which patients seek conservative care typically present as shoulder pain with full or limited movement following an identifiable workplace exposure. Serious underlying conditions, associated with acute mechanically-triggered shoulder pain and restriction, are extremely rare. Flags for non-mechanical conditions include pain at rest, erythema, and unexplained swelling. Posttraumatic deformity and inability to perform any movements are flags for fracture or dislocation. Patient history, location of tenderness, and character of pain guide diagnosis. Examination is useful for discerning between articular, soft tissue, and referred pain sources. Imaging is not indicated initially in the absence of significant precipitating trauma, sudden onset of pain and swelling, palpable mass or deformity, or pain at rest. Acute onset, mild overuse/trauma, and lower shoulder disability scores predict a good outcome with conservative care. Increased age, female gender, severe or recurrent symptoms at presentation, concurrent neck pain, and higher disability scores are associated with poorer outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Case Definition</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clinical presentation of shoulder pain with full or limited movement following mechanical workplace activity/exposure. </li>
    <li>Work place exposures: falls, blunt force, or extended periods of overhead or awkward arm position. </li>
    <li>Diagnosis of a shoulder condition is usually based on clinical criteria. Imaging should be reserved for patients presenting with specific red flags or non-response to 4 to 6 weeks of appropriate conservative care. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evaluation Summary</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Rule-out potential red flag shoulder conditions that require a prompt specialty referral, such as shoulder pain associated with muscle weakness or inability to raise the arm/shoulder, deformity, swelling, fever/chills, suspected malignancy or shoulder instability or dislocation. </li>
    <li>Rule-in mechanical causes prior to initiating manual care. Suspected full-thickness rotator cuff tears should be referred to specialist for urgent evaluation. </li>
    <li>Monitor health-related quality of life and shoulder function (e.g., shoulder questionnaires such as the Simple Shoulder Test [SST] or Shoulder Pain and Disability Index [SPADI]) to establish a baseline to assess improvement over time. </li>
    <li>Provocative testing may correlate with diagnostic categories, but impact on specifying conservative treatment options appears minimal. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intervention Summary</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Limited evidence supports a combined manual approach of mobilization/manipulation, active/passive exercise, and soft tissue techniques for most mechanical shoulder conditions. Early improvement in pain and function is expected for recent acute injuries. Recovery may be delayed in chronic conditions. </li>
    <li>Consider reassessment and specialist consult if there is inadequate response to 4 weeks of conservative care. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>Individual articles were reviewed by both a clinical expert and epidemiologist with subsequent clinical expert group review to resolve inconsistencies.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing Study Methodologic Quality</strong></p>
<p>Attributes of study methodology quality vary according to the clinical procedure (e.g., diagnostic, therapeutic intervention) looked at, and specific research questions being studied. The American Academy of Neurology's Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual offers a comprehensive guide to systematic evidence review, quality attributes and consensus process that generally serves as the approach taken by Industrial Insurance Chiropractic Advisory Committee (IICAC). </p>
<p>General attributes identified when extracting evidence from studies include identification of population, the intervention and co-interventions and outcomes being addressed in each study. The clinical questions addressed such as diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic effectiveness, or causation are determined. Studies are extracted into evidence tables including quality attributes and/or ratings which are reviewed both by department staff and committee members (usually 2 per study).</p>
<p>Specific quality attributes include: Diagnostic Accuracy &ndash; design, spectrum of patients, validity and relevance of outcome metric; Therapeutic Interventions &ndash; comparison groups (no treatment, placebo, comparative intervention), treatment allocation, blinding/masking (method and degree: single, double, independent), follow-up (period and completion), and analysis (statistical power, intent-to-treat). Specific attention is paid to several factors including reporting of outcomes (primary vs. secondary), relevance of outcome (e.g., function versus pain), and meaningfulness (clinically important change versus minimally detectable change).</p>
<p><strong>Synthesizing Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Consideration of study quality (class), significance (statistical precision), consistency across studies, magnitude of effect, and relevance to populations and procedures were taken into account in preparing draft summaries. Special attention was given to clarifying conclusions related to the clinical questions of interest. Evidence, particularly with low tech and highly diffused examination and conservative procedures addressed here, is rarely truly "definitive," even when multiple studies exist. Inconsistent conclusions typically reflect error (systematic, random) and/or bias in studies. Data pooling via meta-analysis is useful to reduce random error when studies are of sufficient power and methodologic strength. Larger meaningful effect size may increases confidence in findings.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The conservative care resource/guideline process can be described in the following steps:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Once a topic for a resource/guideline is selected, a subcommittee of the Industrial Insurance Chiropractic Advisory Committee (IICAC) made up of regular members identifies additional content experts to join the subcommittee and/or serve as consultants. Various clinical specialists may provide specific input or be invited to give a presentation to the subcommittee. </li>
    <li>A systematic review and summary of the relevant peer-reviewed clinical and scientific literature is done (primarily by department staff and subcommittee members with specific interest and/or expertise in a topic). Claim and billing data from Labor &amp; Industries may also be reviewed. </li>
    <li>Literature is retrieved, assessed for quality and summarized in evidence tables which are presented to the subcommittee for review. Then at a variable series of group meetings and phone conferences, the evidence with greatest relevance to the resource/guideline topic is highlighted. </li>
    <li>Based on this literature review and assessment by the subcommittee, department staff typically develop an initial draft resource guideline generally organized as follows:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>General summary of topic, case definition, clinical evaluation, interventions, and clinical progress </li>
        <li>Checklist for general chronological management with expected clinical and progress thresholds </li>
        <li>Readily usable functional progress instruments for a given condition </li>
        <li>Evidence summaries for clinical assessment (e.g., history, examination, imaging and special studies, prognostic and management issues, workers' compensation issues) </li>
        <li>Evidence summaries for conservative interventions (e.g., physiotherapeutic modalities, bracing, manipulation and mobilization, soft tissue techniques, exercise and rehabilitation approaches, special interventions, common medications [injected and oral]), and workers compensation specific interventions (e.g., ergonomic interventions) </li>
        <li>Additional materials (glossaries, procedure descriptions, instrument scoring) </li>
        <li>Evidence and methodology process used in development </li>
        <li>Citations </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Subcommittee members critique and revise the guideline based on what is most useful for the clinician in diagnosing and treating the condition in question. Additional expertise, consultation, and literature searches may also be added. This results in a second draft guideline that is then shared with the full advisory committee to obtain their input. At this stage specific content experts/reviewers may be sought as the subcommittee identifies particular issues. </li>
