<p><strong>Management</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients should be considered for clinical trials. </li>
    <li>Bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) or etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin (VIP) is recommended as first-line chemotherapy, with the number of cycles given based on risk category. </li>
    <li>For failure or relapse on either of these regimens and good risk disease, high dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation can be given. Recommended agents for high dose chemotherapy include ifosfamide, vinblastine, carboplatin, etoposide and paclitaxel. </li>
    <li>Patients who are classified as poor risk at relapse should be considered early for high dose chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, as they may not be well enough to consider this treatment in the third line setting. </li>
    <li>Patients with mediastinal germ cell tumours (GCTs) who relapse have poor prognosis. Transplant should not routinely be offered to these patients. However, depending on the results from salvage chemotherapy, patient performance status, individual factors and patient's desire to pursue the transplant, it may be considered only after an honest discussion between the clinician and patient as the chance of long term remission and cure are very low. </li>
    <li>After the completion of chemotherapy, strong consideration for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection should be given in those patients with retroperitoneal primary GCTs. </li>
    <li>After the completion of chemotherapy, surgery to resect any residual masses should be strongly considered in those patients with mediastinal primary GCTs. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (patient or population, intervention, comparisons, outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Question</strong></p>
<p>What are the appropriate management strategies for patients with primary mediastinal or retroperitoneal germ cell tumours (GCTs)?</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The PubMed database was searched using the terms (retroperitoneal OR mediastinal) AND germ cell AND primary, published between 1946 and 2012 April. Results were limited to clinical trials, studies in humans, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines. The Medline database was then searched for relevant literature using the MeSH terms "Neoplasm, germ cell and embryonal" with subheadings drug therapy, radiotherapy, therapy, and surgery, combined with "extragonadal." Results were limited to literature published between 1946 and 2012 April. Studies involving fewer than ten patients with extragonadal GCTs, as well as single case studies, were excluded.</p>
<p>Websites of the following guideline developers were searched for relevant guidelines: National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Institutes of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), Cancer Council Australia (CCA) and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO).</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Genitourinary Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Trust Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Genitourinary Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
