<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Obstructive voiding symptoms secondary to prostate disease include hesitancy, decreased force of stream, terminal dribbling, postvoid fullness, and double voiding. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of obstructive voiding symptoms, occurring in approximately 25% of men between the ages of 40 and 49. The incidence increases to more than 80% in men between the ages of 70 and 79. Other causes of bladder outlet obstruction include urethral stricture, prostate cancer, bladder neck contracture, bladder calculi, and neurogenic disease.</p>
<p>Imaging is not recommended as a first-line tool in patients suspected of having lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to probable BPH. Rather, treatments including medication are initially focused on alleviating the patient's symptoms. If there is no improvement in symptoms or if there are complicating factors such as hematuria, several imaging studies have been used in evaluating patients with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction. These include radiographs, intravenous urography (IVU), urethrography, transabdominal and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Benefits of imaging patients with obstructive voiding symptoms secondary to prostate disease include determination of the presence and degree of hydronephrosis, estimation of renal function, evaluation of the bladder and prostate, and detection of incidental upper-tract malignancies or stones.</p>
<p><strong>Radiography</strong></p>
<p>Radiography cannot be used to visualize the prostate directly. A distended bladder can be visualized as a pelvic mass, but unless information is available regarding the timing of the patient's last void, this finding is of uncertain value. Prostatic calcifications can be visualized and indicate glandular enlargement if they extend above the pubic symphysis. Bladder calculi can also be identified since approximately 90% of calculi are opaque.</p>
<p>IVU is performed infrequently. In patients with stones, hematuria, or atypical history, the study may be warranted. CT urography has replaced IVU in most centers.</p>
<p>Retrograde urethrography is valuable to exclude urethral strictures but does not accurately assess the size of the prostate gland. Thus it is not part of the routine evaluation of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Voiding cystourethrography should be considered to evaluate for urethral strictures only in men younger than age 50 with outflow obstruction symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Ultrasound</strong></p>
<p>Ultrasound (US) can be used to image the prostate transabdominally (through a distended bladder) or with TRUS. Both transabdominal US and TRUS are equally accurate for measuring prostate volume. Identifying the size of the prostate is important since it helps determine the type of therapy indicated. The US pattern is too nonspecific to differentiate benign from malignant prostate lesions. US can also be used to image opaque and nonopaque bladder calculi, which may be a cause of outlet obstruction or may be secondary to outlet obstruction and chronic retention of urine. Transabdominal ultrasound can also show dilated distal ureters and urinary bladder diverticula.</p>
<p>The size of the enlarged prostate can be detected accurately by TRUS and MRI. Both have an advantage in that the internal prostatic anatomy is better seen and the ratio of glandular to stromal tissue in the prostate can be determined, although this information has not proven clinically useful to date.</p>
<p>The use of resistive index (RI) in prostate disease has been proposed as helpful. RI measured during TRUS has been found to be elevated in the transition zone of patients with BPH but not in the peripheral or central zones and not in normal patients or those with prostate cancer. RI has also been shown to decrease after transurethral vaporization of the prostate, suggesting that it can be used to evaluate the severity of BPH and monitor the outcomes of therapy. TRUS is, however, preferred to guide lesion-directed and systematic biopsies of the prostate.</p>
<p>US contrast agents have been shown to make tumors more conspicuous due to their hypervascularity, thus improving the detection rate of malignancy in contrast-enhanced targeted cases compared to sextant cases. Three-dimensional (3D) US has been shown to add anatomic information from the coronal plane, which may allow better calculation of prostate volume.</p>
<p>Secondary changes of bladder outlet obstruction, such as bladder wall thickening, are better seen with US than with IVU. Measurement of bladder wall thickness can detect bladder outlet obstruction better than free uroflowmetry, postvoid residual urine volume, or prostate volume. In one study, detrusor wall thickness and intravesical prostatic protrusion had the best diagnostic accuracy (87%) for distinguishing bladder obstruction from BPH. US can evaluate the degree of intravesical prostatic protrusion, which may guide therapy. Measurements &gt;1 cm suggest surgical therapy may be preferable to medical therapy.</p>
<p>Abdominal (suprapubic) US may be used to accurately (&plusmn;15%) measure residual urine volume in 90% of patients. However, catheterization is probably the least expensive method to accurately assess residual urine in the bladder.</p>
<p>In patients with azotemia or a high postvoid residual rate, the collecting system of the kidneys should be imaged for evidence of hydronephrosis.</p>
<p><strong>Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging</strong></p>
<p>CT has not proven to be of much value in evaluating the benign, enlarged prostate. Multiparametric MRI has value in prostate cancer evaluation. However, use of MRI for the benign enlarged prostate is limited. MRI can evaluate prostate size and morphology, but other less costly procedures, such as US, are preferred.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that patients with BPH have a higher incidence of asymptomatic renal cancers than the general population in the same age group; therefore, a contrast-enhanced examination to search for occult neoplasms is unwarranted. A prospective study of 502 patients found benign renal cysts in 10%, renal cancers in less than 1%, and significant upper urinary tract obstruction in 2.6%. When patients have obstructive symptoms and renal insufficiency, US rather than contrast-enhanced examination is recommended to evaluate for hydronephrosis. In patients with severe hydronephrosis, azotemia is almost always present, and US is indicated. In summary, although not routinely recommended, upper urinary tract imaging preferably with CT or MRI is indicated in patients with BPH and one or more of the following: hematuria (including asymptomatic microscopic hematuria), laboratory evidence of renal insufficiency, history of urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, previous urinary tract surgery, or congenital or acquired renal disease.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For patients who have normal renal function but suffer lower urinary tract symptoms, imaging workup should be minimal. </li>
    <li>US is occasionally desirable for estimating prostate size, intravesical prostate protrusion, bladder volume, and detrusor thickness prior to surgery. </li>
    <li>If azotemia is present, the upper urinary tracts should definitely be evaluated with US for the presence of hydronephrosis. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Search Procedure</strong></p>
<p>Staff search in PubMed only for peer reviewed medical literature for routine searches. Any article or guideline may be used by the author in the narrative but those materials may have been identified outside of the routine literature search process.</p>
<p>The Medline literature search is based on keywords provided by the topic author. The two general classes of keywords are those related to the condition (e.g., ankle pain, fever) and those that describe the diagnostic or therapeutic intervention of interest (e.g., mammography, MRI).</p>
<p>The search terms and parameters are manipulated to produce the most relevant, current evidence to address the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria (ACR AC) topic being reviewed or developed. Combining the clinical conditions and diagnostic modalities or therapeutic procedures narrows the search to be relevant to the topic. Exploding the term "diagnostic imaging" captures relevant results for diagnostic topics.</p>
<p>The following criteria/limits are used in the searches.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The topic author drafts or revises the narrative text summarizing the evidence found in the literature. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff draft an evidence table based on the analysis of the selected literature.

<p>The expert panel reviews the narrative text, evidence table, and the supporting literature for each of the topic-variant combinations and assigns an appropriateness rating for each procedure listed in the table.

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Rating Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p>The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures included in the Appropriateness Criteria topics are determined using a modified Delphi methodology. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff distribute surveys to the panelists along with the evidence table and narrative. Each panelist interprets the available evidence and rates each procedure. The surveys are completed by panelists without consulting other panelists. The appropriateness rating scale is an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category "usually not appropriate"; 4, 5, or 6 are in the category "may be appropriate"; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category "usually appropriate." Each panel member assigns one rating for each procedure for a clinical scenario. The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating.</p>
<p>If consensus is reached, the median rating is assigned as the panel's final recommendation/rating. Consensus is defined as eighty percent (80%) agreement within a rating category. A maximum of three rounds may be conducted to reach consensus. Consensus among the panel members must be achieved to determine the final rating for each procedure.</p>
<p>If consensus is not reached, the panel is convened by conference call. The strengths and weaknesses of each imaging procedure that has not reached consensus are discussed and a final rating is proposed. If the panelists on the call agree, the rating is proposed as the panel's consensus. The document is circulated to all the panelists to make the final determination. If consensus cannot be reached on the call or when the document is circulated, "No consensus" appears in the rating column and the reasons for this decision are added to the comment sections.</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to express individual interpretations of the evidence and his or her expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized and economical process. A more detailed explanation of the complete process can be found in additional methodology documents found on the <a href="http://www.acr.org/ac" title="ACR Web site">ACR Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Relative Radiation Level</strong></p>
<p>Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria&reg; Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination.</p></div>
