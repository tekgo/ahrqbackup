<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Foot ulceration is the most common single precursor to lower extremity amputations among persons with diabetes. Shoe trauma, in concert with loss of protective sensation and concomitant foot deformity, is the leading event precipitating foot ulceration in persons with diabetes. Treatment of infected foot wounds accounts for up to one-quarter of all inpatient hospital admissions for people with diabetes in the United States. Peripheral sensory neuropathy in the absence of perceived trauma is the primary factor leading to diabetic foot ulcerations. Approximately 45% to 60% of all diabetic ulcerations are purely neuropathic. In people with diabetes, 22.8% have foot problems -- such as amputations and numbness -- compared with 10% of nondiabetics. Over the age of 40 years old, 30% of people with diabetes have loss of sensation in their feet.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Recommendation Statements</span></strong>:</p>
<p>The multifactorial etiology of diabetic foot ulcers is evidenced by the numerous pathophysiologic pathways that can potentially lead to this disorder. Among these are two common mechanisms by which foot deformity and neuropathy may induce skin breakdown in persons with diabetes. The first mechanism of injury refers to prolonged low pressure over a bony prominence (i.e., bunion or hammertoe deformity). This generally causes wounds over the medial, lateral, and dorsal aspects of the forefoot and is associated with tight or ill-fitting shoes (American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons/American College of Foot and Ankle Orthopedics and Medicine [ACFAS/ACFAOM] Clinical Practice Guidelines).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Fifteen per cent of patients with diabetes will develop a foot ulcer at some point in their life. Ill-fitting footwear frequently contributes to foot ulceration. A good fitting shoe is an essential component in the management of the diabetic foot. The objective of this study was to assess the feet and footwear of patients with diabetes to determine whether they are wearing the correct-sized shoes. <em>Methods</em>: One-hundred patients with diabetes who were attending the general diabetic clinic had their foot length measured using a 'Clarks' shoe shop device and foot width using a pair of callipers. Measurements were taken whilst seated and standing. Shoe dimensions were also assessed by recording the manufactured shoe length and using callipers to assess shoe width. A calibrated measuring stick standardised shoe lengths. Neurovascular status and the presence of deformities in the foot were also recorded. <em>Results</em>: One-third of diabetic patients were wearing the correct shoes on either foot whilst seated or whilst standing. However, only 24% of patients were wearing shoes that were of the correct length and width for both feet whilst seated and 20% upon standing. Seventeen percent of patients appeared in both groups. No significance was found between any other variables, such as sensory neuropathy. <em>Conclusions</em>: Many patients with diabetes wear shoes that do not fit, particularly, shoes that are too narrow for their foot width. Assessing the appropriateness of footwear maybe an important part of foot examination (Harrison et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Poorly fitting footwear has frequently been cited as an etiologic factor in the pathway to diabetic foot ulceration. However, the researchers are unaware of any reports in the medical literature specifically measuring shoe size versus foot size in this high-risk population. Researchers assessed the prevalence of poorly fitting footwear in individuals with and without diabetic foot ulceration. They evaluated the shoe size of 440 consecutive patients (94.1% male; mean +/- standard deviation [SD] age, 67.2 +/- 12.5 years) presenting to an interdisciplinary teaching clinic. Of this population, 58.4% were diagnosed as having diabetes, and 6.8% had active diabetic foot ulceration. Only 25.5% of the patients were wearing appropriately sized shoes. Individuals with diabetic foot ulceration were 5.1 times more likely to have poorly fitting shoes than those without a wound (93.3% versus 73.2%; odds ratio [OR], 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-21.9; P = .02). This association was also evident when assessing only the 32.3% of the total population with diabetes and loss of protective sensation (93.3% versus 75.0%; OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.1-20.9; P = .04). Poorly fitting shoes seem to be more prevalent in people with diabetic foot wounds than in those without wounds with or without peripheral neuropathy. This implies that appropriate meticulous screening for shoe-foot mismatches may be useful in reducing the risk of lower-extremity ulceration (Nixon et al., 2006). </li>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Measures Tested</strong></p>
<p>Measures from the Diabetes Mellitus: Foot and Ankle Care measure set tested in the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) Testing project: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Ulcer Prevention - Evaluation of Footwear </li>
    <li>Peripheral Neuropathy - Neurological Evaluation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>Three physician office sites participated in this measure testing project. Originally, four sites were identified and selected by Dr. James R. Christina, Director of Scientific Affairs for the APMA. One site withdrew due to time constraints resulting from a change in practice ownership. </p>
<p>All three physician office sites participating in this measure testing project represented urban settings on the East Coast. The practices each had two or more physicians, with physicians actively involved with APMA. </p>
<p>Two trained data abstractors performed on-site chart reviews the weeks of October 1 and November 5, 2012. Testing was performed on paper medical records at one physician office site and in the electronic health record (EHR) environment for two physician office sites. The case samples for chart reviews were randomly selected from eligible patients seen at two of the test sites between January 1 and December 31, 2011. Due to a change in the billing system, one test site requested a change in the chart sample timeframe to October 1, 2011 through May 1, 2012 to allow for accurate identification of eligible patients. </p>
<p><strong>Testing Performed and Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Feasibility</em>: Test site personnel completed a data collection questionnaire to provide information about the presence and location of each data element comprising the two measures within the medical record to assess the feasibility of data capture, calculation and reporting of the performance measures in a timely manner and at reasonable cost.</p>
<p><em>Results</em>: This test revealed that it was feasible to implement these performance measures at the test sites with some EHR modifications.</p>
<p><strong>Validation Against the Gold Standard Reliability</strong></p>
<p>Parallel-forms reliability testing was performed by comparing manual abstraction of the data elements necessary to construct the measure from the medical records with Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) claims submission. Agreement was calculated between the two methods at the level of the numerator, denominator and exception (if applicable). </p>
<p>To validate inclusion in the numerator, the practice sites provided various identification methods. Two practices provided a report of the sampled list of patients per encounter with the PQRS codes submitted. The third site provided instructions on viewing the billing codes per dates or invoice within each patient's medical record.</p>
<p>Agreement rates were calculated and reported with kappa statistics with 95% confidence intervals to recognize any agreement that could be attributable to chance alone.</p>
<p><em>Results</em>: The measures were found to be highly reliable with agreement rates ranging from 93 to 100%.</p>
<p>Refer to the APMA <em>2012 Measure Testing Project: Diabetic Foot &amp; Ankle Care</em> for additional testing details.</p></div>
