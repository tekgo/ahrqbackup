Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: These recommended practices provide guidance to perioperative personnel for evaluating, selecting, and using packaging systems and for packaging the items to be sterilized and subsequently used in the perioperative setting. Packaging systems should permit sterilization of the contents within the package, protect the integrity of the sterilized contents, prevent contamination of the contents until the package is opened for use, and permit the aseptic delivery of the contents to the sterile field. Packaging systems include woven fabrics, non-woven materials, paper-plastic pouches, Tyvek&reg;-plastic pouches, plastic-plastic pouches, and containment devices (e.g., sterilization containers, instrument cases, cassettes, organizing trays) composed of a variety of materials. These recommended practices do not include recommendations for cleaning contaminated instruments, loading a sterilizer, or sterilization.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>Packaging systems and packaging materials should be evaluated before purchase and use (American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation [ANSI/AAMI], 2012). </li>
    <li>Packaging systems should be compatible with the specific sterilization method for which they will be used. </li>
    <li>Packaging materials should be processed and stored in a way that maintains the qualities required for sterilization. </li>
    <li>Items to be sterilized should be packaged in a manner that facilitates sterilization and provides for an aseptic presentation of the package contents. Packaging should be used according to the packaging manufacturer's and sterilizer manufacturer's written instructions for use (IFU). </li>
    <li>Chemical indicators specific to the sterilization method selected should be used with each package (see the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the AORN guideline <a href="/content.aspx?id=37868" title="Guideline #9199">Recommended practices for sterilization</a>). </li>
    <li>Reusable woven packaging materials should be inspected and monitored throughout the life of the product. </li>
    <li>Peel pouches (i.e., paper-plastic, Tyvek, Mylar) should be used according to manufacturers' written IFU (ANSI/AAMI, 2012). </li>
    <li>A rigid sterilization container should be used, cleaned, inspected, repaired, and maintained according to the manufacturer's written IFU. </li>
    <li>Packages to be sterilized should be labeled. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members with responsibilities for selection and/or use of packaging systems should receive initial and ongoing education and competency verification on their understanding of selection and use of packaging systems. </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for selection and use of packaging systems should be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting in which they are used. </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should participate in a variety of quality assurance and performance improvement activities that are consistent with the health care organization's plan to improve understanding of and compliance with the principles and processes of selection and use of packaging systems. </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Evidence Review</strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic literature search of the databases MEDLINE&reg;, CINAHL&reg;, Scopus&reg;, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, randomized and non-randomized trials and studies, systematic and non-systematic reviews, and opinion documents and letters.</p>
<p>Search terms included: surgical equipment, surgical instruments, dental instruments, organizing tray, instrument set, loaner instrument, medical packaging, product packaging, device packaging, product labeling, packaging material, sterilization container, rigid container, instrument case, instrument cassette, packaging system, reusable pack, pouch, heat sealer, sequential wrapping, plastics, textiles, fabrics, Mylar, Tyvek, Kraft, olefin, paper, polypropylene, polypropene, barrier integrity, barrier system, barrier properties, sterility maintenance cover, sterilization, flash sterilization, immediate use sterilization, infection control, microbial colony count, cross infection, equipment contamination, humidity, steam, condensation, equipment reuse, single-use, event-related, time-related, time-dependent, event-dependent, outdating, monitoring, quality control, materials testing, indicators and reagents, package integrity, equipment failure, safety management, hospital central supply, sterile processing, and hospital purchasing.</p>
<p>The lead author and the medical librarian identified and obtained relevant guidelines from government agencies, other professional organizations, and standards-setting bodies. The lead author assessed additional professional literature, including some that was cited in other articles provided to the author. The initial search was confined to the years 2005 to 2012 and limited to English-language articles. The time restriction was not applied in subsequent searches. The librarian also established continuing alerts on the topics included in this recommended practices document and provided relevant results to the lead author. The majority of research regarding packaging was related to shelf life and was conducted more than 10 years ago when facilities were transitioning from time-related shelf life to event-related shelf life. Articles addressing other aspects of packaging were quite limited. It is evident from the literature search that there is a need for additional research on all aspects of packaging for sterilization.</p></div>
