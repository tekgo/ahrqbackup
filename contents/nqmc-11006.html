Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure addresses patient autonomy for patients with high severity of illness and risk of death, including seriously and incurably ill patients enrolled in hospice or hospital-based palliative care. The National Priorities Partnership has identified palliative and end-of-life care as one of its national priorities. A goal of this priority is to ensure that all patients with life-limiting illness have the right to express preferences that guide use of invasive or life-sustaining forms of treatment. The affected populations are large; in 2009, 1.56 million people with life-limiting illness received hospice care ("NHPCO facts and figures," 2010). In 2008, 58.5% of United States (U.S.) hospitals with 50 or more beds had some form of palliative care service, and national trends show steady expansion of these services ("Palliative care programs," 2010).</p>
<p>Patients and family caregivers rate control over treatment decisions as a high priority when living with serious and life-limiting illnesses (Singer, Martin, &amp; Kelner, 1999). From a recent systematic review of clinical trials, moderate evidence supports multicomponent interventions to increase advance directives, and "care planning through engaging values, involving skilled facilitators, and focusing on key decision makers." These studies found improved outcomes of patient-physician communication, improved satisfaction with care, and increased hospice enrollment (Lorenz et al., 2008). The more recently published Coping with Cancer Study, a prospective observational study of over 300 patients with advanced cancer, found that communication of patient treatment preferences was associated with use of treatments honoring those preferences and wish lesser use of aggressive, high-cost treatments (Wright et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2008).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Seriously ill and dying patients who are given the opportunity to express life-sustaining treatment preferences are more likely to receive care consistent with their values, and patient and family satisfaction outcomes improve. Patients and physicians alike hesitate to initiate discussions, while acknowledging their value and desirability. Use of the Treatment Preferences quality measure will improve attention to this important practice, in order to enhance patient autonomy, facilitate patient centered decision-making, and communicate patient preferences via documentation to other treating providers.</p>
<p>Poor communication about patient preferences has been identified as a major quality concern in palliative and end-of-life care since an early, comprehensive Institute of Medicine report (Field &amp; Cassel, 1997). The SUPPORT Study found marked discrepancies between patient report of treatment preferences and provider awareness of or use of these preferences to guide treatment ("A controlled trial," 1995). Patients and families prioritize communication with providers and control over treatment choices when faced with serious or life-threatening illness (Steinhauser et al., 2001). However, physicians and other providers fail to open the door to these discussions at critical time points in illness progression (Gysels, Richardson, &amp; Higginson, 2004). A recent systematic review of communication research found a consistent discrepancy between the quality and content of communication providers believed they provided, and the quality and content of communication experienced by seriously ill patients and their families (Hancock et al., 2007).</p>
<p>In advanced incurable illness, treatment options range from life-sustaining and disease modifying interventions to control of acute exacerbations to hospice care. African Americans with advanced cancer less often access treatment through clinical trials, palliative care for pain management, or hospice (Smith, Earle, &amp; McCarthy, 2009; Cintron &amp; Morrison, 2006). They less often prepare advance directives, including Health Care Powers of Attorney that can facilitate family advocacy during illness (Hanson &amp; Rodgman, 1996; Murphy et al., 1996; Morrison et al., 1998; Tilden et al., 2004; Kiely et al., 2001; Hopp &amp; Duffy, 2000). If these choices are fully informed expressions of values, they should be supported. However, African Americans desire more information on treatment options and are less likely to have discussions with their physicians, indicating that communication and information access serve as barriers to optimal care (McKinley et al., 1996; Borum, Lynn, &amp; Zhong, 2000; Haas et al., 1993; Born et al., 2004).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Two research nurse abstractors independently recorded quality measures data on a random subset of 20 seriously ill patients. Abstractors used the pre-defined operational definitions and a structured chart abstraction tool to record numerator and denominator data separately. Patients were a subsample of 460 seriously ill patients without specialty palliative care admitted to an acute care hospital for at least 1 day to four inpatient services. Records eligible for sampling included all seriously ill adult patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care, medically complex patients aged 65 and older admitted to an acute care of the elderly unit, and medical oncology patients with Stage IV carcinoma. </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Inter-rater reliability between the two abstractors was assessed using kappa statistics. </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. The nurse abstractors achieved perfect (Kappa=1.0) inter-rater reliability for this measure. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Hospice: The total patient sample size was 126. Fourteen hospices, located in seven different states, representing both free-standing and hospital based providers were recruited to participate. Each hospice was asked to contribute data from nine patient records to the study. Nine hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine discharges; five hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine admissions. </p>
<p>Palliative Care: The total patient sample size was 562. Chart abstractions were completed for 102 consecutive seriously ill patients with specialty palliative care consultation, and a random sample of 460 seriously ill patients without specialty palliative care admitted to an acute care hospital for at least 1 day to four inpatient services with high proportions of seriously ill patients. Records eligible for sampling included all patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care, medically complex patients aged 65 and older admitted to a geriatric evaluation unit, and medical oncology patients with Stage IV carcinoma. Because palliative care domains become even more relevant closer to death, patients dying in hospital were oversampled to ensure a final ratio of 1 decedent to 1 live discharge. Consistent with oversampling of decedent records, 55% of these patients died in hospital. The age of the patients ranged from 16 to 99 years, with the mean age 61. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (65%), with smaller subgroups who were African American (24%) and Hispanic/Latino (4%). The most common life-limiting diagnoses were infections (37%), cancer (34%), pulmonary (29%), and neurologic diseases (21%). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Hospice sample: Face validity was tested using formal expert panel review. The PEACE project team convened a 14-member technical expert panel (TEP) of nationally recognized experts with extensive experience in the following areas: medical or nursing expertise in hospice and palliative care, methods and instrumentation, and quality improvement. Using criteria provided by the Carolinas Center for Medical Excellence (CCME) study team, TEP members rated each potential quality measure from 1 (low) to 5 (high) on four criteria: importance, scientific soundness, feasibility and usability. The rating criteria mirrored those used by the National Quality Forum and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Measures Management System. To identify the measures with the most favorable ratings, a summary measure was created. For each quality measure, the average TEP rating was calculated for each criterion and then an overall average measure rating (AMR) was tabulated, weighting each the criteria equally. </p>
<p>Palliative Care sample: Face validity of PEACE quality measures for hospital-based specialty palliative care was addressed using stakeholder review and feedback. Investigators prepared data reports in a summary format with detailed operational definitions, and led a 1-hour discussion with nursing and physician leaders from each service group &ndash; medical intensive care unit (MICU), surgical intensive care unit (SICU), acute care for the elderly (geriatrics), oncology, and palliative care. The discussion included feedback of quality measure data, response to questions and critiques, and eliciting stakeholder feedback about the validity and actionability of this data for the care of their patients. Stakeholders were specifically asked to comment on the accuracy of the data as a reflection of current care practices, and their highest priority area for future quality improvement. </p>
<p>Construct validity was tested by comparing the PEACE quality measures for patients seen by specialty interdisciplinary palliative care consultants to those not receiving specialty palliative care services.</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. Hospice sample: Completed ratings were received from 13 of the 14 TEP members. The 75th percentile cut-point translated into an AMR=3.73 (on a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 is highest). This process resulted in the identification of 23 measures with the highest TEP ratings for importance, scientific soundness, feasibility and usability. Medical record documentation of life-sustaining preferences had an overall rating of 4.04.</p>
<p>Palliative Care sample: Face Validity: Stakeholder discussions provided broad endorsement of face validity, with some considerations for specific patient populations. Medical oncologists endorsed the face validity of these quality measures, but favored quality measures endorsed by oncology professional organizations. </p>
<p>Construct Validity: Patients who received specialty palliative care were more likely to have documentation of their preferences for or against receiving life-sustaining treatments (91% vs 59%, p greater than 0.001). </p>
<p><strong>Identification of Meaningful Differences in Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Hospice: The total patient sample size was 126. Fourteen hospices, located in seven different states, representing both free-standing and hospital based providers, were recruited to participate. Each hospice was asked to contribute data from nine patient records to the study. Nine hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine discharges; five hospices were asked to collect data on their most recent nine admissions. </p>
<p>A common structured data collection tool was developed for use by all hospices, regardless of whether the patient record was an admission or discharge record. Instructions embedded in the tool indicated the data items appropriate to each type of record. Hospices were instructed not to institute new data collection procedures for the data collection pilot. If a data item could not be found, they were told to mark the item as "unable to determine." </p>
<p>A data dictionary containing item-specific instructions and notes related to the patient data collection tool was distributed to each hospice center. Technical assistance was provided by email and phone to staff during the data collection period. Questions, and responses, that arose during data collection were immediately distributed to all hospices participating in the data pilot.</p>
<p>Palliative Care: The total patient sample size was 562. Chart abstractions were completed for 102 consecutive seriously ill patients with specialty palliative care consultation, and a random sample of 460 seriously ill patients without specialty palliative care admitted to an acute care hospital for at least 1 day to four inpatient services with high proportions of seriously ill patients. Records eligible for sampling included all patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care, medically complex patients aged 65 and older admitted to a geriatric evaluation unit, and medical oncology patients with Stage IV carcinoma. Because palliative care domains become even more relevant closer to death, patients dying in hospital were oversampled to ensure a final ratio of 1 decedent to 1 live discharge. Consistent with oversampling of decedent records, 55% of these patients died in hospital. The age of the patients ranged from 16 to 99 years, with the mean age 61. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (65%), with smaller subgroups who were African American (24%) and Hispanic/Latino (4%). The most common life-limiting diagnoses were infections (37%), cancer (34%), pulmonary (29%), and neurologic diseases (21%). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Construct validity was tested by comparing the PEACE quality measures for patients seen by specialty interdisciplinary palliative care consultants to those not receiving specialty palliative care services. Percentage of patients with and without specialty palliative care for whom the quality measure was met was compared for difference using the chi-square statistic. </p>
<p><em>Results</em>. Hospice sample: 81.5% of patients had documentation of treatment preferences; 3% of reviewed records had no information. </p>
<p>Palliative care sample: Seriously ill hospitalized patients who received specialty palliative care were more likely to have documentation of their treatment preferences compared to patients without specialty palliative care (91% vs 59%, p&gt;0.001).</p></div>

Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Inclusions</strong><br />
Patients whose medical record includes documentation of life sustaining preferences </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Documentation of life-sustaining treatment preferences should reflect patient self-report; if not available due to patient loss of decisional capacity, discussion with surrogate decision-maker and/or review of advance directive documents are acceptable. The numerator condition is based on the process of eliciting and recording preferences, whether the preference statement is for or against the use of various life-sustaining treatments such as resuscitation, ventilator support, dialysis, or use of intensive care or hospital admission. This item is meant to capture evidence of discussion and communication. Therefore, brief statements about an order written about life sustaining treatment, such as "Full Code" or "Do not resuscitate/Do not intubate (DNR/DNI)" do not count in the numerator. Documentation using the Physician Orders for Life-sustaining Treatment (POLST) paradigm with evidence of patient or surrogate involvement, such as co-signature or description of discussion, is adequate evidence and can be counted in this numerator.</p>
