</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>The incidence of vertebral artery injury may be as high as 11% after non-penetrating cervical spinal trauma in patients meeting specific clinical and physical exam criteria. The modified Denver Screening Criteria for blunt cerebrovascular injuries (BCVI) are the most commonly used. Many patients with VAI have complete spinal cord injuries, fractures through the foramen transversarium, cervical spinal facet dislocation injuries, and/or vertebral subluxation, but many patients with these spinal and spinal cord injuries have normal vertebral arteries when imaged, thus reducing the specificity of these injury patterns with respect to VAI. Many comparative studies in which sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value have been, or can be, calculated examined various tests against each other, but not against the gold standard of intravenous catheter angiography, thereby producing <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence. However, recent literature providing <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence does support CTA as a highly accurate alternative to catheter angiography for screening for VAI in blunt injury trauma patients, with a very high negative predictive value.</p>
<p>It appears that a significant number of the symptomatic strokes resulting in neurological deficits following VAI are attributable to the initial blunt traumatic injury. The majority of patients with VAI are asymptomatic, including a number of patients with incidental cerebellar and posterior circulation strokes found on imaging studies at the time of diagnosis or in follow-up. To date, there has been no definitive longitudinal study defining the stroke risk of VAI, asymptomatic or otherwise, among patients being treated for known VAI and/or among patients receiving "no treatment" for known VAI. There is no <strong>Class I</strong> or <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence on the issue of therapy for VAI. <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence suggests that a small number of patients with VAI will develop a posterior circulation stroke in delayed fashion beyond deficits associated with the initial traumatic injury. While no conclusive medical evidence supports treatment for VAI, most clinicians support treatment for patients with symptomatic VAI with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Because of an increased relative risk of hemorrhagic complications from anticoagulation therapy for VAI, without clear superior efficacy, anticoagulation therapy is not considered ideal treatment in multiple trauma patients with VAI, symptomatic or asymptomatic. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin the most studied) appears to be a safe and comparable option for symptomatic patients with VAI after blunt trauma.</p>
<p>No treatment or antiplatelet therapy appears to be a comparable option for the treatment of asymptomatic patients with documented VAI. Because antiplatelet therapy has the potential to reduce future stroke risk, treatment with aspirin for documented VAI after trauma should be considered in patients if there exist no contraindications to antiplatelet therapy. At present, the choice of therapy, if any, for patients with VAI should be individualized based on the patient's VAIs, associated traumatic injuries, and the relative risk of bleeding associated with that form of therapy.</p>

<p>A National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search of publications from 1966 to 2011 was performed using the following headings: vertebral artery injury, vertebral artery dissection, cervical fracture, and cervical dislocation. The search was limited to the English language and human subjects and identified 2,226 citations. The titles and abstracts of these references were reviewed to determine relevance. Isolated case reports, small case series, editorials, letters to the editor, and review articles were eliminated.

Potential Benefits

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Catheter angiography is an invasive and labor-intensive procedure, is not always readily available, and has a low, but finite risk. </li>
    <li>Because of an increased relative risk of hemorrhagic complications from anticoagulation therapy for vertebral artery injuries (VAI), without clear superior efficacy, anticoagulation therapy is not considered ideal treatment in multiple trauma patients with VAI, symptomatic or asymptomatic. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Contraindications

<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Traumatic vertebral artery injury (VAI) occurs in multiple injured trauma patients and is more likely to occur in association with the most severe cervical spine and spinal cord injuries&mdash;all of which represent relative contraindications to anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies in the treatment of potential posterior distribution stroke. </li>
    <li>The need for dual antiplatelet therapy after endovascular procedures and their potential for bleeding complications is a relative contraindication to the application of endovascular therapy in multiple injury trauma patients with VAI. </li>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
