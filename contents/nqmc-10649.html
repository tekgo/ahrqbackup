Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Bereaved Family Survey (BFS) assesses families' (next-of-kin) perceptions of the end-of-life care (care delivered in the last 30 days of life) provided to veterans who die in an inpatient Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) (intensive care, acute care, hospice unit, nursing home care unit or community living center).</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A growing body of research has underscored the degree to which end-of-life care in the United States needs to be improved (Hanson, Danis, &amp; Garrett, 1997; Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2014; Teno et al., 2004). The challenges of end-of-life care are particularly significant in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system because the VA provides care for an increasingly older population with multiple comorbid conditions (Edes, Shreve, &amp; Casarett, 2007).</p>
<p>The VA has addressed this challenge through the Comprehensive End of Life Care Initiative (2009-2015), with the goal of honoring veterans' preferences for care by expanding the access to and quality of hospice and palliative care (Edes, Shreve, &amp; Casarett, 2007). The Initiative supported the establishment and training of palliative care teams in all VA inpatient facilities and the building or remodeling of specialized hospice and palliative care units. It also provided an infrastructure for ongoing support and quality improvement. The Performance Reporting and Outcomes Measurement to Improve the Standard of care at End-of-life (PROMISE Center) is part of that infrastructure. Its goals are to: identify and reduce unwanted variation in the quality of end-of-life care throughout the VA; and 2) define and disseminate processes of care ("Best Practices") that contribute to improved outcomes for Veterans near the end of life and their families. The primary outcome for the Center's work in the Bereaved Family Survey (BFS).</p>
<p>The BFS uses a well-established and validated approach to assessing the quality of end-of-life care, that is, by surveying family members' perceptions of care (Casarett et al., "Important aspects," 2008; Casarett et al., "A nationwide," 2008; Finlay, Shreve, &amp; Casarett, 2008). This strategy provides several advantages. Persons with serious illness who are approaching death may not be capable of responding to questionnaires due to debility, fatigue, cognitive impairment and/or inability to communicate. Family members answer on behalf of these patients to provide detailed information on the care at time of the patient's death. In hospice and palliative care, post-death interviews and surveys with bereaved family members are common (Hanson, Danis, &amp; Garrett, 1997; Connor et al., 2005). </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Approximately 2% of all veterans die every year. Of those, 20% are enrolled in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system, and 5% die in VA facilities (Edes, Shreve, &amp; Casarett, 2007). </li>
    <li>Most VA decedents included are disabled, frail elderly, and terminally ill, and a significant percentage also qualify as either mentally ill, medically uninsured, poverty population, homeless, or urban population as well (Edes, Shreve, &amp; Casarett, 2007). </li>
    <li>Problems in end-of-life care have become increasingly well documented. There is substantial evidence that physical symptoms such as pain, nausea, constipation, and dyspnea are very common among patients near the end of life. Moreover, clinicians are often unable to recognize these symptoms and manage them adequately. Other studies have found that providers do not communicate with patients about their health care preferences, and that providers' treatment decisions are not always consistent with those preferences. For example, many patients receive aggressive life-sustaining treatment that is not consistent with their preferences (Hanson, Danis, &amp; Garrett, 1997; Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2014; Lynn et al., 1997). </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Bereaved Family Survey (BFS) was developed based on interviews with over 1,000 family members, and pilot testing has included an additional 1,000 family members. The 17 closed-ended survey items were selected from among the items in the Family Assessment of Treatment at End-of-life (a Veterans Affairs [VA]-specific instrument developed with support from a VA HSRD Merit Award) based on their psychometric characteristics and homogeneity as measured by the Cronbach's alpha, psychometric characteristics, and discriminant validity (Casarett et al., "Important aspects," 2008; Casarett et al., "A nationwide," 2008). The BFS was predominantly administered by phone survey from fiscal year (FY)2010-2012, and transitioned to mail survey in FY2013. Both modes of BFS administration have been extensively studied and validated (Smith et al., 2015; Thorpe et al., 2016).</p>
<p>The entire BFS is used for quality improvement and the BFS Performance Measure (BFS-PM) also is used for accountability in the Veterans Health Administration. The BFS-PM is defined as the percentage of respondents who rate the overall care of the Veteran in the last 30 days of life as "Excellent" (versus: Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor). </p>
<p>As of 2015, the BFS has been administered to over 120,000 family members of deceased veterans in all 146 VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) nationwide with a response rate of 54%. Data collection has provided the following evidence of its reliability and validity. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><em>Nonresponse bias</em>: Currently, several predictors of response have been found and include patient characteristics (non-Hispanic white, older age with a spouse as BFS respondent) as well as clinical care indicators (presence of a do not resuscitate [DNR] order, receipt of a palliative consult, chaplain contact or bereavement contact, and death outside of an acute setting). After adjusting for nonresponse, the mean change in the BFS-PM score for all facilities is -2 percentage points, with a range of -10% to 11%. Twenty-one facilities did not change their BFS-PM scores (Smith et al., 2015). </li>
    <li><em>Survey psychometric characteristics</em>: The BFS contains 19 items; 16 forced-choice items focus on specific aspects of care. One item, which is the basis for the BFS-PM, asks respondents for a global rating of care in the last month of life. All items use Likert scale response options whose scores are dichotomized as 1 for the best possible response and 0 for all other responses. Two additional open-ended questions solicit comments on the aspects of care. All items, except for the pain management item (mean 22, standard deviation 41) are slightly skewed with a predominance of higher scores (mean 70, standard deviation 44). The average missing rate for each item is 2%. Cronbach's alpha for the survey items is 0.85, indicating good homogeneity that is sufficient for between-group comparisons (e.g., comparisons among facilities). Recent evidence identified three factors (respectful care and communication, benefits, and emotional/spiritual support) (Thorpe et al., 2016). This analysis also demonstrated strong support for the validity of the mailed version of the BFS and measurement invariance between the phone and mail BFS versions (Thorpe et al., 2016). </li>
    <li><em>Reliability</em>: As is typical of surveys of bereaved family members, this survey has not undergone testing of retest reliability. However, available evidence indicates that families' perceptions of care are stable over time. That is, there are no significant differences in the respondent's rating of the care for each BFS item over the last five years. </li>
    <li><em>Validity</em>: The most important test of the survey's usefulness is its discriminant validity. That is, its ability to distinguish among groups that should, in theory, have different scores. Testing of the BFS has identified the following evidence of its discriminant validity:
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
        <li>The use of a palliative care consult is associated with a higher BFS-PM score compared to usual care (mean 64 vs. 51; p&lt;0.001) (Casarett et al., "Do palliative," 2008). </li>
        <li>Death in an inpatient hospice unit is associated with a higher BFS-PM score than death on an acute care ward or community living center (mean 68 vs. 55; p&lt;0.001) (Ersek et al., 2015). </li>
        <li>Presence of a DNR order at death is associated with a higher BFS-PM score than no DNR at death (Finlay, Shreve, &amp; Casarett, 2008; Thorpe et al., 2016). </li>
        <li>Family or veteran contact with a chaplain is associated with a higher spiritual support score compared to those who did not have contact with a chaplain (Finlay, Shreve, &amp; Casarett, 2008; Thorpe et al., 2016). </li>
        <li>A bereavement contact with a family member after the veteran's death is associated with higher emotional support after death scores compared to family members who did not receive a bereavement contact (Finlay, Shreve, &amp; Casarett, 2008; Thorpe et al., 2016). </li>
    </ol>
