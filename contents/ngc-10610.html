Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: The original guideline document provides guidance for the perioperative registered nurse (RN) caring for a patient who is receiving local anesthesia by injection, infiltration, or topical application. The original guideline document includes guidance for patient assessment, patient monitoring, recognition and treatment of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), assessment for local anesthetic allergies, and documentation of patient care. It is not the intent to address situations that require the services of an anesthesia professional or to substitute the services of a perioperative RN in those situations that require the services of an anesthesia professional.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>The perioperative RN should perform a preoperative nursing assessment for the patient who will receive local anesthesia. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should monitor and document the patient's physiological and psychological responses, identify nursing diagnoses based on assessment of the data, and implement the plan of care. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should receive initial and ongoing education and competency verification on his or her understanding of local anesthesia pharmacology, calculation of total dose, contraindications, desired effects, adverse effects, and resuscitation. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should provide patient education regarding perioperative care of patients undergoing local anesthesia. </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for the care of the patient receiving local anesthesia should be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Evidence Review</strong></p>
<p>On April 15, 2013, a medical librarian conducted a systematic search of the databases MEDLINE&reg;, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL&reg;), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled and non-randomized trials and studies, case reports, reviews, and guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies. The librarian also searched the Scopus&reg; database, although not systematically. The search was limited to literature published in English since January 2006. At the time of the initial search, the librarian established weekly alerts on the search topics and until July 2014, presented relevant results to the lead author. During the development of this guideline, the author requested supplementary literature searches and additional literature that either did not fit the original search criteria or was discovered during the evidence-appraisal process.</p>
<p>Although the lead author's original search request encompassed both moderate sedation and local anesthesia, only literature relevant to the care and management of patients receiving local anesthesia was considered for inclusion in this document. Of the 862 sources deemed appropriate for consideration in the areas of moderate sedation and local anesthesia, 63 were identified as relevant to local anesthesia (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document for a flow diagram of literature search results). Germane search terms included <em>surgical procedures, analgesia, local anesthesia, topical anesthesia, local infiltration, lidocaine, bupivacaine, anxiety, anti-anxiety agents, drug hypersensitivity, allergy, anaphylaxis, risk assessment, physical examination, vital signs, blood pressure, blood pressure determination, pulse, physiologic monitoring, advanced cardiac life support, ACLS, nurse's role,</em> and <em>perioperative nursing</em>.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and studies that addressed moderate sedation, regional anesthesia, pediatric patients, or pregnant patients. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher-quality evidence was available.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The evidence supporting each intervention and activity statement within a specific recommendation was summarized, and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Evidence-Rating Model was used to rate the strength of the collective evidence.

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evidence from a meta-analysis or systematic review of research studies that incorporated evidence appraisal and synthesis of the evidence in the analysis. </li>
    <li>Supportive evidence from a single well-conducted randomized controlled trial. </li>
    <li>Guidelines that are developed by a panel of experts, that derive from an explicit literature search methodology, and include evidence appraisal and synthesis of the evidence. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1: Regulatory Requirement</strong>: Federal law or regulation.</p>
<p><strong>2: Moderate Evidence</strong>: Interventions or activities for which the evidence is less well established than for those listed under "1: Strong Evidence."</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Supportive evidence from a well-conducted research study. </li>
    <li>Guidelines developed by a panel of experts which are primarily based on the evidence but not supported by evidence appraisal and synthesis of the evidence. </li>
    <li>Non-research evidence with consistent results and fairly definitive conclusions. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3: Limited Evidence</strong>: Interventions or activities for which there are currently insufficient evidence or evidence of inadequate quality.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Supportive evidence from a poorly conducted research study. </li>
    <li>Evidence from non-experimental studies with high potential for bias. </li>

    <li>Non-research evidence with insufficient evidence or inconsistent results. </li>
    <li>Conflicting evidence, but where the preponderance of the evidence supports the recommendation. </li>

<p><strong>4: Benefits Balanced with Harms</strong>: Selected interventions or activities for which the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Recommended Practices Advisory Board (RPAB) is of the opinion that the desirable effects of following this recommendation outweigh the harms.</p>
