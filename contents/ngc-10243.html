Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: These recommended practices are intended to provide guidance to perioperative team members on the use of pneumatic tourniquets. These recommended practices provide information about testing, applying, and cleaning pneumatic tourniquet equipment, and the patient care associated with the safe use of this equipment. Pneumatic tourniquet equipment consists of a pressure regulator with display, connective tubing, and an inflatable cuff. These recommended practices provide general guidelines for developing policies and procedures for safe use of a pneumatic tourniquet in the practice setting. Due to the variety and complexity of pneumatic tourniquet equipment, policies and procedures that reflect considerations for specific pneumatic tourniquet systems are beyond the scope of these recommendations. Finger tourniquets and tourniquets used for phlebotomy or traumatic bleeding are outside the scope of this document.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>The perioperative registered nurse (RN) should assess the patient preoperatively for risks and potential contraindications related to the use of a pneumatic tourniquet. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should collaborate with the surgeon and anesthesia professional to develop and confirm the plan of care related to the use of a tourniquet. </li>
    <li>Patient safety should be the primary consideration when using a pneumatic tourniquet and its accessories. </li>
    <li>Inflation of the tourniquet cuff should be done under the direction of the surgeon and coordinated with the anesthesia professional. </li>
    <li>Tourniquet inflation time and patient condition should be monitored while the tourniquet cuff is inflated. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should collaborate with the surgeon and anesthesia professional to implement safe practices when deflating the pneumatic tourniquet. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should evaluate the outcome of patient care after the tourniquet has been deflated. </li>
    <li>The pneumatic tourniquet and accessories should be cleaned after each use according to the manufacturer's written instructions. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should receive initial and ongoing education and competency verification on the use of the pneumatic tourniquet and on their understanding of the physiologic responses that influence the care of a patient undergoing pneumatic tourniquet-assisted operative or invasive procedures. </li>
    <li>Documentation should reflect activities related to the care of the patient undergoing pneumatic tourniquet-assisted operative or other invasive procedures. </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for use of pneumatic tourniquets should be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting. </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should participate in quality assurance and performance improvement activities that are consistent with the health care organization's plan to improve understanding of the physiologic responses that influence the care of a patient undergoing pneumatic tourniquet-assisted operative or other invasive procedures and compliance with safe practices when using pneumatic tourniquets. </li>

<p>A medical librarian conducted searches of the databases MEDLINE&reg;, CINAHL&reg;, Scopus&reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled and non-randomized trials, guidelines, and case reports.</p>
<p>Search terms included: pneumatic tourniquet, tourniquet safety, tourniquet, surgical hemostasis, surgical procedures, nursing care, perioperative care, patient positioning, compartment syndromes, arm injuries, leg injuries, hand injuries, pain measurement, peripheral nervous system, peripheral nervous system diseases, nerve palsy, metabolic phenomena, metabolic changes, metabolic effects, vital signs, respiration, carbon dioxide, intracranial pressure, oxygen consumption, cardiac output, acidosis, hyperemia, venous congestion, blood pressure, lactic acid, hemodynamics, pulse, hypothermia, hyperthermia, systemic inflammatory response, Esmarch bandage, Urias bag, Pomidor roll-cuff, bandage, elastic wrap, intravenous regional anesthesia, Bier block, ankle block, conduction anesthesia, bloodless field, occlusion pressure, ischemia, and reperfusion injury.</p>
<p>The search was limited to articles published in English between January 2006 and February 2012. The search was expanded to include articles published before 2006 when the original search did not identify more recent literature on a particular topic. The librarian established continuing alerts on the pneumatic tourniquet topics. The lead author and librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies.</p></div>
