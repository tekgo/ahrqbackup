    <li>Carbohydrate loading should be encouraged before surgery in nondiabetic patients. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B.</strong> </li>
    <li>Mechanical bowel preparation plus oral antibiotic bowel preparation before colorectal surgery is the preferred preparation and is associated with reduced complication rates. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Preadmission Optimization</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">

</ol>
<p><strong>Preadmission Orders</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Preset orders should be used as a part of the enhanced care pathway. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Perioperative Interventions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Surgical Site Infection</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A bundle of measures should be in place to reduce surgical site infection. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pain Control</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A multimodal, opioid-sparing, pain management plan should be used and implemented before the induction of anesthesia. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
    <li>Thoracic epidural analgesia is recommended for open colorectal surgery, but not for routine use in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Perioperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Antiemetic prophylaxis should be guided by preoperative screening for risk factors for postoperative nausea/vomiting. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B.</strong> </li>
    <li>Preemptive, multimodal antiemetic prophylaxis should be used in all at-risk patients to reduce PONV. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Intraoperative Fluid Management</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Maintenance infusion of crystalloids should be tailored to avoid excess fluid administration and volume overload. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
    <li>Balanced chloride-restricted crystalloid solutions should be used as maintenance infusion in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C.</strong> </li>
    <li>In high-risk patients and in patients undergoing major colorectal surgery associated with significant intravascular losses, the use of goal-directed fluid therapy is recommended. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Surgical Approach</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>A minimally invasive surgical approach should be used whenever the expertise is available and appropriate. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A.</strong> </li>
    <li>The routine use of intra-abdominal drains and nasogastric tubes for colorectal surgery should be avoided. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Postoperative Interventions</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>Patient Mobilization</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Early and progressive patient mobilization is associated with shorter length of stay. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ileus Prevention</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients should be offered a regular diet immediately after elective colorectal surgery. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
    <li>Sham feeding (i.e., chewing sugar-free gum for &ge;10 minutes 3 to 4 times per day) after colorectal surgery is safe, results in small improvements in gastrointestinal (GI) recovery, and may be associated with a reduction in the length of hospital stay. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
    <li>Alvimopan is recommended to hasten recovery after open colorectal surgery, although its use in minimally invasive surgery remains less clear. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Postoperative Fluid Management </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Intravenous fluids should be discontinued in the early postoperative period after recovery room discharge. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Urinary Catheters</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Urinary catheters should be removed within 24 hours of elective colonic or upper rectal resection when not involving a vesicular fistula, irrespective of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) use. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>
    <li>Urinary catheters should be removed within 48 hours of midrectal/lower rectal resections. <strong>Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.</strong> </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The details of specific search strategies, including search terms, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, total number of studies identified, and tables of evidence for each statement, are available in the supplements, but all of the search strategies involved an organized search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews using a variety of key word combinations (for details on key words and search strategies see Supplementary Document 1 [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Systematic searches were conducted from 1990 to March 2016 and were restricted to English-language articles. Directed searches of the embedded references from the primary articles were also performed in certain circumstances. Prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses were given preference in developing these guidelines.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A 2011 Cochrane review found that enhanced recovery protocols (ERPs) were associated with a reduction in overall complications and length of stay when compared with conventional perioperative patient management. Subsequent studies have shown that ERPs are associated with reduced healthcare costs and improved patient satisfaction. ERPs are also associated with improved outcomes regardless of whether patients undergo laparoscopic or open surgery. Studies have also shown that ERPs cannot simply be implemented and forgotten but require a continued audit process in place to guide compliance and to continue to improve quality.</p>
<p>Refer to the original guideline document for benefits associated with specific interventions.</p></div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Experimental and observational clinical studies have shown that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of anastomotic leakage. </li>
    <li>Systemic perioperative gabapentinoids, ketamine, and &alpha;2-agonists have also been administered to improve analgesia and reduce systemic opioid consumption and postoperative hyperalgesia, but psychotropic adverse effects, dizziness, and sedation may impair immediate recovery. Moreover, the optimal gabapentinoids regimen (dose, timing, and duration of administration) still needs to be determined. </li>
    <li>Trials and meta-analyses have shown that thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) has no impact on or may even delay hospital discharge in laparoscopic surgery. This delay is probably related to the higher incidence of hypotension and urinary tract infections requiring additional postoperative care. </li>
    <li>With early oral feeding, providers must be cognizant that the risk of vomiting increases. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>This clinical practice guideline is based on the best available evidence. These guidelines are inclusive and not prescriptive. Their purpose is to provide information on which decisions can be made rather than to dictate a specific form of treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners, healthcare workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed toward obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient. </p></div>
