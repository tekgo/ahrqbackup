<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence <strong>(I-III)</strong> and classification of recommendations <strong>(A-E, L)</strong> are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations."</p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Most women can be successfully fitted with a pessary when they present with prolapse. <strong>(II-2)</strong> </li>
    <li>Complications of pessary use are usually minor, and vaginal discharge is the most common complaint. <strong>(II-3)</strong> </li>
    <li>Vaginal erosions can be treated with removal of the pessary and optional vaginal estrogen supplementation. <strong>(II-2)</strong> </li>
    <li>Satisfaction rates with pessary use are very high. <strong>(II-2)</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Pessaries should be considered in all women presenting with symptomatic prolapse and/or urinary stress incontinence. <strong>(II-1A)</strong> </li>

<p><strong>Quality of Evidence Assessment*</strong></p>

<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence from well-designed cohort (prospective or retrospective) or case&ndash;control studies, preferably from more than one centre or research group</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from comparisons between times or places with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the results of treatment with penicillin in the 1940s) could also be included in this category</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees</p>
<p class="Note">* Adapted from The Evaluation of Evidence criteria described in the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations&dagger;</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> There is good evidence to recommend the clinical preventive action</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>PubMed and Medline were searched for articles published in English to September 2010, using the key words pessary, prolapse, incontinence, fitting, and complications. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials (RCTs)/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. Searches were updated on a regular basis, and articles were incorporated in the guideline to May 2012. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Minor complications of pessary use such as vaginal discharge, odour, and erosions can usually be successfully treated. </li>
