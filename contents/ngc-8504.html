Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Patients with Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN), What Is the Efficacy of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce Pain and Improve Physical Function and Quality of Life (QOL)?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Anticonvulsants</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Based on consistent Class I evidence, pregabalin is established as effective in lessening the pain of PDN. Pregabalin also improves QOL and lessens sleep interference, though the effect size is small. Based on one Class I study, gabapentin is probably effective in lessening the pain of PDN. Based on 2 Class II studies, sodium valproate is probably effective in treating PDN. Lamotrigine is probably not effective in treating PDN. Based on Class II evidence, oxcarbazepine is probably not effective in treating PDN. There is conflicting Class III evidence for the effectiveness of topiramate in treating PDN. Based on Class III evidence, lacosamide is possibly not effective in treating PDN. The degree of pain relief afforded by anticonvulsant agents is not associated with improved physical function.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>If clinically appropriate, pregabalin should be offered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Gabapentin and sodium valproate should be considered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of topiramate for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>Oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and lacosamide should probably not be considered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>Although sodium valproate may be effective in treating PDN, it is potentially teratogenic and should be avoided in diabetic women of childbearing age. Due to potential adverse effects such as weight gain and potential worsening of glycemic control, this drug is unlikely to be the first treatment choice for PDN.</p>
<p><strong>Antidepressants</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Based on 3 Class I and 5 Class II studies, the antidepressants amitriptyline, venlafaxine, and duloxetine are probably effective in lessening the pain of PDN. Venlafaxine and duloxetine also improve QOL. Venlafaxine is superior to placebo in relieving pain when added to gabapentin. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether desipramine, imipramine, fluoxetine, or the combination of nortriptyline and fluphenazine are effective for the treatment of PDN.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Amitriptyline, venlafaxine, and duloxetine should be considered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level B</strong>). Data are insufficient to recommend one of these agents over the others. </li>
    <li>Venlafaxine may be added to gabapentin for a better response (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of desipramine, imipramine, fluoxetine, or the combination of nortriptyline and fluphenazine in the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Opioids</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Based on one Class I study, dextromethorphan is probably effective in lessening the pain of PDN and improving QOL. Based on Class II evidence, morphine sulfate, tramadol, and oxycodone controlled release are probably effective in lessening the pain of PDN. Dextromethorphan, tramadol, and oxycodone controlled-release have moderate effect sizes, reducing pain by 27% compared with placebo.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Dextromethorphan, morphine sulfate, tramadol, and oxycodone should be considered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level B</strong>). Data are insufficient to recommend one agent over the other.</p>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>The use of opioids for chronic nonmalignant pain has gained credence over the last decade due to the studies reviewed in this article. Both tramadol and dextromethorphan were associated with substantial adverse events (e.g., sedation in 18% on tramadol and 58% on dextromethorphan, nausea in 23% on tramadol, and constipation in 21% on tramadol). The use of opioids can be associated with the development of novel pain syndromes such as rebound headache. Chronic use of opioids leads to tolerance and frequent escalation of dose.</p>
<p><strong>Other Pharmacologic Agents</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em></p>
<p>Based on Class I and Class II evidence, capsaicin cream is probably effective in lessening the pain of PDN. Based on Class III studies, there is insufficient evidence to determine if intravenous lidocaine is effective in lessening the pain of PDN. Based on Class III evidence, the Lidoderm patch is possibly effective in lessening the pain of PDN. Based on Class I evidence, clonidine and pentoxifylline are probably not effective for the treatment of PDN. The evidence for the effectiveness of mexiletine is contradictory; however, the only Class I study of this agent indicates that mexiletine is probably ineffective for the treatment of PDN. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether vitamins and &alpha;-lipoic acid are effective for the treatment of PDN. Based on Class I evidence, isosorbide dinitrate spray is probably effective for the treatment of PDN.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Capsaicin and isosorbide dinitrate spray should be considered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clonidine, pentoxifylline, and mexiletine should probably not be considered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The Lidoderm patch may be considered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of vitamins and &alpha;-lipoic acid in the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Clinical Context</em></p>
<p>Although capsaicin has been effective in reducing pain in PDN clinical trials, many patients are intolerant of the side effects, mainly burning pain on contact with warm/hot water or in hot weather.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Patients with PDN, What Is the Efficacy of Nonpharmacologic Modalities to Reduce Pain and Improve Physical Function and QOL?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Electrical Stimulation, Magnetic Field Treatment, Other Interventions</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>Based on a Class I study, electrical stimulation&nbsp;is probably effective in lessening the pain of PDN and improving QOL. Based on single Class I studies, electromagnetic field treatment, low-intensity laser treatment, and Reiki therapy are probably not effective for the treatment of PDN. There is not enough evidence to support or exclude a benefit of amitriptyline plus electrotherapy in treating PDN.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation should be considered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Electromagnetic field treatment, low-intensity laser treatment, and Reiki therapy should probably not be considered for the treatment of PDN (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of amitriptyline plus electrotherapy for treatment of PDN (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Rating of a Therapeutic Article</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences. The following are also required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for drop-outs (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and cross-overs with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias </li>
    <li>For non-inferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or non-inferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the results of the study is based upon a per protocol analysis that takes into account dropouts or crossovers. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A randomized controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a&ndash;e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b&ndash;e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.**</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria including consensus or expert opinion.</p>
<p class="Note">*Note that numbers 1-3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class="Note">**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p></div>

<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) Subcommittee member who had expertise in neuropathies conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were NOT met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists. This guideline is currently considered outdated, and will be retired following publication of an updated guideline. This guideline update project has been approved and is on the GDDI's waitlist; it has not yet been initiated. However, as there are no safety concerns with the content of this guideline and no other guidance exists on the topic, this guideline will retain a current status until publication of the updated guideline.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although sodium valproate may be effective in treating painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), it is potentially teratogenic and should be avoided in diabetic women of childbearing age. Due to potential adverse effects such as weight gain and potential worsening of glycemic control, this drug is unlikely to be the first treatment choice for PDN. </li>
    <li>Both tramadol and dextromethorphan were associated with substantial adverse events (e.g., sedation in 18% on tramadol and 58% on dextromethorphan, nausea in 23% on tramadol, and constipation in 21% on tramadol). The use of opioids can be associated with the development of novel pain syndromes such as rebound headache. Chronic use of opioids leads to tolerance and frequent escalation of dose. </li>
    <li>Although capsaicin has been effective in reducing pain in PDN clinical trials, many patients are intolerant of the side effects, mainly burning pain on contact with warm/hot water or in hot weather. </li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This statement is provided as an educational service of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). It is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. It is not intended to include all possible proper methods of care for a particular neurologic problem or all legitimate criteria for choosing to use a specific procedure. Neither is it intended to exclude any reasonable alternative methodologies. The AAN recognizes that specific patient care decisions are the prerogative of the patient and the physician caring for the patient, based on all of the circumstances involved. The clinical context section is made available in order to place the evidence-based guideline(s) into perspective with current practice habits and challenges. No formal practice recommendations should be inferred. </li>
    <li>It is notable that the placebo effect varied from 0% to 50% pain reduction in the reported studies. Adjuvant analgesic agents are drugs primarily developed for an indication other than treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) (e.g., anticonvulsants and antidepressants) that have been found to lessen pain when given to patients with PDN. Their use in the treatment of PDN is common. The panel recognizes that PDN is a chronic disease and that there are no data on the efficacy of the chronic use of any treatment, as most trials have durations of 2&ndash;20 weeks. It is important to note that the evidence is limited, the degree of effectiveness can be minor, the side effects can be intolerable, the impact on improving physical function is limited, and the cost is high, particularly for novel agents. </li>
