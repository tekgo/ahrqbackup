Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence assessment (<strong>I-III</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>A-D, L</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) After Insertion</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>All women requesting an intrauterine device (IUD) should be counselled about the small increased risk of PID in the first 20 days after insertion. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Role of and Indications for Screening for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li>All women requesting an IUD should be screened by both history and physical examination for their risk of STI. Women at increased risk should be tested prior to or at the time of insertion; however, it is not necessary to delay insertion until results are returned. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bacterial Vaginosis</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>Not enough current evidence is available to support routine screening for bacterial vaginosis at the time of insertion of an IUD in asymptomatic women. (<strong>II-2C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Role of Prophylactic Antibiotics</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
    <li>Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended prior to IUD insertion, although it may be used in certain high-risk situations. (<strong>I-C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Insertion Technique</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>Standard practice includes cleansing the cervix and sterilizing any instruments that will be used prior to and during insertion of an IUD. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Management of PID with IUD In Situ</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li>In treating mild to moderate PID, it is not necessary to remove the IUD during treatment unless the patient requests removal or there is no clinical improvement after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment. In cases of severe PID, consideration can be given to removing the IUD after an appropriate antibiotic regimen has been started. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Populations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Positive Women</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="7">
    <li>An IUD is a safe, effective option for contraception in an HIV-positive woman. (<strong>I-B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Adolescents</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="8">
    <li>An IUD can be considered a first-line contraceptive agent in adolescents. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
</ol>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>When sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing first and delaying insertion to a follow-up appointment, consideration must be given to the likelihood of the patient being able to return, and the potential benefit of decreasing the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) from 0&ndash;5% to 0&ndash;2% must be weighed against the risk of unintended pregnancy during this time. </li>
    <li>The role of poor aseptic technique in the risk of PID after intrauterine device (IUD) insertion is not well-known, but it is well documented in other areas including puerperal and postabortion infection. Intrauterine microbial contamination is highest in the first month of insertion and decreases with time. The risk of potentially infectious vectors being introduced into the cavity at the time of IUD insertion is long established; however, this risk is short-lived. </li>
