Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: In 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published a guideline (CG64) on prophylaxis against infective endocarditis. This 2015 guideline on the same topic updates and replaces the 2008 publication. See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of the 2008 guideline and the guideline addendum (providing the 2015 guideline update methods and evidence).</p>
<p>No new recommendations have been added for this update. For recommendations marked as <strong>[2015]</strong> the evidence has been reviewed but no change has been made to the recommended action.</p>
<p>The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example, words such as 'offer' and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation) and is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adults and Children with Structural Cardiac Defects at Risk of Developing Infective Endocarditis</span></strong></p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should regard people with the following cardiac conditions as being at risk of developing infective endocarditis:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Acquired valvular heart disease with stenosis or regurgitation </li>
    <li>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy </li>
    <li>Previous infective endocarditis </li>
    <li>Structural congenital heart disease, including surgically corrected or palliated structural conditions, but excluding isolated atrial septal defect, fully repaired ventricular septal defect or fully repaired patent ductus arteriosus, and closure devices that are judged to be endothelialised </li>
    <li>Valve replacement <strong>[2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patient Advice</span></strong></p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should offer people at risk of infective endocarditis clear and consistent information about prevention, including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis, and an explanation of why antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer routinely recommended </li>
    <li>The importance of maintaining good oral health </li>
    <li>Symptoms that may indicate infective endocarditis and when to seek expert advice </li>
    <li>The risks of undergoing invasive procedures, including non-medical procedures such as body piercing or tattooing <strong>[2015]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prophylaxis Against Infective Endocarditis</span></strong></p>
<p>Antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is not recommended:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For people undergoing dental procedures </li>
    <li>For people undergoing non-dental procedures at the following sites<sup>1</sup>:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Upper and lower gastrointestinal tract </li>
        <li>Genitourinary tract; this includes urological, gynaecological and obstetric procedures, and childbirth </li>
        <li>Upper and lower respiratory tract; this includes ear, nose and throat procedures and bronchoscopy <strong>[2015]</strong> </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Chlorhexidine mouthwash should not be offered as prophylaxis against infective endocarditis to people at risk of infective endocarditis undergoing dental procedures. <strong>[2015]</strong></p>
<p class="Note"><sup>1</sup>The evidence reviews for this guideline covered only procedures at the sites listed in this recommendation. Procedures at other sites are outside the scope of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Infection</span></strong></p>
<p>Any episodes of infection in people at risk of infective endocarditis should be investigated and treated promptly to reduce the risk of endocarditis developing. <strong>[2015]</strong></p>
<p>If a person at risk of infective endocarditis is receiving antimicrobial therapy because they are undergoing a gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedure at a site where there is a suspected infection, the person should receive an antibiotic that covers organisms that cause infective endocarditis. <strong>[2015]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Committee makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the Committee is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most people would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><em>Recommendations That Must (or Must Not) Be Followed</em></p>
<p>The Committee usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations That Should (or Should Not) Be Followed &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Recommendations that an intervention should be used are made when the Committee is confident that for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similarly, the Committee recommends that an intervention should not be used when confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations That Could Be Followed</em></p>
<p>Recommendations that an intervention could be used are made when the Committee is confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: In 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published a guideline (CG64) on prophylaxis against infective endocarditis. This 2015 guideline on the same topic updates and replaces the 2008 publication. See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of the 2008 guideline and the guideline addendum (providing the 2015 guideline update methods and evidence).</p>
<p>This guideline update was developed based on the process and methods described in The Manual 2014 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Where there are deviations from the process and methods, these are clearly stated in the <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/article/pmg16/" title="NICE Web site">Interim clinical guideline surveillance process and methods guide 2013</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>See the "Clinical Evidence Review" sections in the guideline addendum. Databases that were searched, together with the number of articles retrieved from each database for each question, are shown in Appendix D of the guideline addendum. The search strategy for each question is also shown in Appendix D.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Economics</span></strong></p>
<p>A systematic literature search was undertaken to identify health economic evidence within published literature relevant to prophylaxis against infective endocarditis. The evidence was identified by conducting a broad search in the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), the Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) and the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) from 2007 (date of the last systematic review conducted for the previous version of the guideline) to 2014. The search also included Medline and EMBASE databases using an economic filter. Studies published in languages other than English were not reviewed. The search was conducted on 20 November 2014. The health economic search strategy is detailed in Appendix I of the guideline addendum.</p>
<p>The health economist also sought out relevant studies identified by the surveillance review, Standing Committee members, or Topic experts.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Full economic evaluations (studies comparing costs and health consequences of alternative courses of action: cost-utility, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and cost-consequence analyses) and comparative costing studies that address the review question in the relevant population were considered potentially includable as economic evidence.</p>
<p>Studies that only reported burden of disease or cost of illness were excluded. Literature reviews, abstracts, posters, letters, editorials, comment articles, unpublished studies and studies not in English were excluded.</p>
<p>Remaining studies were prioritised for inclusion based on their relative applicability to the development of this guideline and the study limitations. For example, if a high quality, directly applicable UK analysis was available, then other less relevant studies may not have been included. Where selective exclusions occurred on this basis, this is noted in the excluded economic studies table (Appendix K of the guideline addendum). For more details about the assessment of applicability and methodological quality see the economic evaluation checklist contained in Appendix H of <em>Developing NICE Guidelines: the manual 2014</em> (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

A list of excluded articles with the reasons for exclusion is provided in Appendix F of the guideline addendum.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Economics Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The search retrieved 998 articles. The titles and abstracts were screened for possible inclusion and 8 articles were selected for further examination of the full text version. An additional 5 articles from the 2008 review for this guideline were also considered for inclusion along with the original economic evaluation conducted for the 2008 guideline. An economic evaluation that was not published at the time of the literature review conducted by The University of Sheffield was also included giving a total of 15 full-text economic evaluations that were considered. Four studies were selected for inclusion in the present update including the 2008 NICE model and the 2015 Sheffield model.</p>
<p>A review flowchart is provided in Appendix J of the guideline addendum, and the excluded studies (with reasons for exclusion) are shown in Appendix K of the guideline addendum.</p></div>

<h3>
Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The economic evidence profiles in Section 2.6.4 of the guideline addendum (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarise cost-effectiveness estimates for infective endocarditis prophylaxis for dental and non-dental procedures. The economic evidence profiles show an assessment of the applicability and methodological quality for each economic evaluation, with footnotes indicating the reasons for the assessment. These assessments were made by the health economist using the economic evaluation checklist from Appendix H of <em>Developing NICE Guidelines: the manual 2014</em> (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The economic profiles also show the incremental cost, incremental effect and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the base case analysis in the evaluation, as well as information about the assessment of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix L in the guideline addendum for additional information pertaining to the economic evidence. Appendix P in the guideline addendum provides the University of Sheffield's 2015 update of the 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) economic model on the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic for patients at risk of infective endocarditis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-effectiveness Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>NICE's report Social value judgements: principles for the development of NICE guidance sets out the principles that GDGs should consider when judging whether an intervention offers good value for money. In general, an intervention was considered to be cost effective if either of the following criteria applied (given that the estimate was considered plausible):</p>
<li>the intervention dominated other relevant strategies (that is, it was both less costly in terms of resource use and more clinically effective compared with all the other relevant alternative strategies), or </li>
<li>the intervention cost less than &pound;20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with the next best strategy
<p>If the Committee recommended an intervention that was estimated to cost more than &pound;20,000 per QALY gained, or did not recommend one that was estimated to cost less than &pound;20,000 per QALY gained, the reasons for this decision are discussed explicitly in the 'Recommendations and link to evidence' section of the relevant chapter, with reference to issues regarding the plausibility of the estimate or to the factors set out in Social value judgements: principles for the development of NICE guidance.</p>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The guideline committee noted the lack of data on side effects including anaphylaxis from antibiotic prophylaxis and therefore the difficulty in establishing a balance between potential side effects and benefit of prophylaxis, if any. Furthermore, the occurrence of other effects of antibiotic usage including the risk of antibiotic resistance was noted but not covered by the evidence identified. The committee highlighted that resistance is thought to be increasing in streptococci and other pathogens but is largely dependent on the patient group and therefore difficult to quantify. The committee concluded that in the absence of clear evidence on efficacy, overuse of antibiotics should be avoided to prevent community resistance. </li>
    <li>Overall, there was inconsistent evidence across the studies with some studies indicating that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of bacteraemia post-procedure but does not eliminate it. </li>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Healthcare professionals are expected to take National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of each patient, in consultation with the patient and/or their guardian or carer. </li>
    <li>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the person about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision (see also the 'Patient-centred care' section in the original guideline document). </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Piloting and Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of the work to pilot the contents of this guideline or validate any approach to implementation. These limitations excepted, every effort has been made to maximise the relevance of recommendations to the intended audience through the use of a guideline development group (GDG) with relevant professional and patient involvement, by use of relevant experienced expert reviewers and the stakeholder process facilitated by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Short Clinical Guidelines Technical Team. Implementation support tools for this guideline will be available from the Implementation Team at NICE.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audit Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations have been used to develop clinical audit criteria for use in practice. Audit criteria are essential implementation tools for monitoring the uptake and impact of guidelines and thus need to be clear and straightforward for organisations and professionals to use.</p>
<p>NICE has commissioned the Clinical Accountability, Service Planning and Evaluation (CASPE) Research Unit and Health Quality Service (HQS) to develop the audit criteria for all its guidance as part of its implementation strategy.</p></div>
