Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) applications approved or denied for new ADAP enrollment within 14 days (two weeks) of ADAP receiving a complete application in the measurement year.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related morbidity and mortality has dropped dramatically due to advances in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment. But reductions are uneven across HIV-infected populations due to unequal access to care and variable quality of services provided. Quality management seeks to enhance the quality of HIV care provided and increase access to services. They do so by measuring how health and social services meet established professional standards and user expectations.</p>
<p>Timely review for AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) eligibility can ensure timely access to medications. This quality measure has been used by the Part B Collaborative and Low Incidence Initiative to measure performance and to develop successful improvement projects to decrease the length of time to determine ADAP eligibility or ineligibility by the ADAP program.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>This measure addresses the intent of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) treatment guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents and the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected individuals (Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, 2009; Working Group on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of HIV-Infected Children, 2009; Panel on Treatment of HIV-Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission, 2009; Kaplan et al., 2009; Mofenson et al., 2009).</p></div>
