Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>These recommendations were adapted from: Management of Malignant Melanoma: Best Practices, 2006 (Canadian Expert Panel on Malignant Melanoma) (see the "Adaptation" field).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Enrollment in a clinical trial should be encouraged/considered. </li>
    <li>Most patients with in situ or early-stage melanoma will be cured by primary excision alone. Therefore, no standard adjuvant therapy is recommended for patients with melanoma that is in situ, less than 2 mm thick, 2&ndash;4 mm thick but non-ulcerated or node-negative. </li>
    <li>Patients with primary tumours that are 2.01&ndash;4.0 mm thick and ulcerated, deep primary tumours (T4), primary tumour of any thickness with positive sentinel nodes or resected overt nodal disease, including patients who relapse in the nodal basin, should be referred to medical oncology for consideration for adjuvant therapy. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients who are at high-risk for disease recurrence following complete surgical resection of the primary tumour are eligible for adjuvant treatment with interferon-alfa (IFN&alpha;). </li>
    <li>Prior to the initiation of treatment rule out metastatic disease:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Refer to staging guidelines (Balch et al., 2009) (see the Appendix in the original guideline document) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Contraindications to interferon are:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>A history of hypersensitivity to IFN&alpha; </li>
        <li>Active cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction within 6 months, active angina, or dysrhythmias) </li>
        <li>Pre-existing liver disease </li>
        <li>Central nervous system disease </li>
        <li>Serious psychiatric conditions (including major depression) </li>
        <li>Active autoimmune disease </li>
        <li>Any debilitating medical condition is a relative contraindication because of the toxicities expected </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Before initiating high-dose adjuvant interferon therapy, the following baseline laboratory tests are required (Eggermont, 2002; Smylie et al., 2006):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Complete blood count (CBC)/differential </li>
        <li>Hemoglobin </li>
        <li>Hematocrit </li>
        <li>Platelets </li>
        <li>Blood chemistry including electrolytes </li>
        <li>Liver function tests (LFTs; alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase [ALT/AST]) </li>
        <li>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) </li>
        <li>Additional testing, such as creatine phosphokinase (CPK) if abnormal troponin level, anti-thyroid antibodies and anti-nuclear antibodies, may be required </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Pre-medication: acetaminophen 650 mg by mouth (PO) 30 minutes pre-intravenous (IV) IFN&alpha; and every 4&ndash;6 hours regularly during induction phase. </li>
    <li>Induction phase: 20 MU/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously 5 days per week for 4 weeks
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Depending on the patient's performance status and symptoms, a rest period of 2 weeks between induction phase (weeks 1&ndash;4) and maintenance phase (weeks 5&ndash;52) may be considered ("BCCA protocol summary," 2006) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Maintenance phase: 10 MU/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneously&nbsp;3 times per week for 48 weeks </li>
    <li>Laboratory tests should be performed weekly during induction phase and monthly during maintenance phase ("BCCA protocol summary," 2006):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>CBC and differential, platelets, LFTs </li>
        <li>Assessment for mood changes during clinic visits </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Side Effects</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Fever, chills and rigors often occur when interferon therapy is first initiated but diminish over time. </li>
    <li>Treatment with IFN&alpha; is associated with a significant number of side effects that require close monitoring (Guillot et al., 2004; de Lemos, 2001; Kirkwood et al., 2002). These side effects may hamper reaching and maintaining the dose needed for maximal therapeutic effect (Sleijfer et al., 2005).
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Common side effects are fatigue, fever, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, headache and chills ("flu-like" symptoms). </li>
        <li>The incidence of severe neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, can be as high as 10% so close monitoring is recommended. Referral to a psychiatrist may be required. </li>
        <li>The following are recommended to alleviate side effects:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Regular exercise to relieve fatigue. </li>
            <li>Due to fluid losses through increased heart and metabolic rates, fever and sweats, an aggressive fluid hydration strategy is recommended. Administer 500 mL IV normal saline before each IV infusion. A daily oral intake of &ge;2 litres of fluids, especially water, throughout therapy is advised. Avoid caffeine and alcohol containing beverages as they can cause dehydration. </li>
            <li>Acetaminophen before each injection and/or at bedtime; consider another antipyretic/anti-inflammatory if acetaminophen is not effective. </li>
            <li>Headaches are common. Tension-type headaches may require mild opioids. Migraine-like headaches may require treatment as for migraine. </li>
            <li>Patients should be advised that side effects are worse on Mondays. </li>
            <li>An anti-emetic (e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) may be required to relieve nausea; 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) antagonists can be helpful for chronic nausea. </li>
            <li>Depression can be treated with antidepressants. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Long-term side effects that can result in dose alterations, disruptions and even discontinuation of therapy are (Agarwala, 2002):
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Hepatotoxicity: Transient elevations in AST and ALT are common. Elevations more than five times the normal range require dose adjustment. </li>
            <li>If radiation is to be part of the regimen, IFN&alpha; should not be given concurrently due to the risk of skin toxicity. </li>
            <li>Patients with psoriasis may experience a worsening of their condition. This may require a dermatology consult. </li>
            <li>Weight loss is common and patients may benefit from dietary counseling. If there is clinical concern, a dose reduction or cessation of therapy is indicated. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Potentially life-threatening side effects can occur but these are rare:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>In the event of serious side effects, the dose should be held until the medical oncologist is contacted. </li>
            <li>If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500 cells/mL or ALT/AST &gt;5&ndash;10 times normal, it is recommended that subsequent doses be held until the toxicity resolves re-initiation, which should be started at 50% of the previous IFN&alpha; dose. </li>
            <li>Therapy should be discontinued if the ANC &lt;250 cells/mL and/or ALT/AST &gt;10 times normal. </li>
            <li>Suicidal ideation has been reported and is a contraindication to further IFN&alpha;-2b therapy (Valentine et al., 1998). </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Considerations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The successful administration of IFN&alpha;-2b requires the services of a specialized and committed team of health care professionals, including physician, oncology nurse, social worker, pharmacist, and behavioral therapist or psychologist. </li>
    <li>Because hematologic and hepatic toxicity associated with high-dose interferon (HDI) therapy can be severe, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure safety. White blood cell counts and liver function tests should be performed weekly during induction and monthly during maintenance therapy for at least 3 months, and then at least every 3 months in patients who are stable with no new complaints. </li>
    <li>Patient education is vital to help understand and anticipate the nature of the side effects and the interventions available to manage adverse events and preserve quality of life. </li>
    <li>During the maintenance phase, constitutional symptoms are managed by administering IFN&alpha; at bedtime with prophylactic antipyretics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. </li>
    <li>Meperidine may be useful for severe chills and rigors. Nausea and vomiting are uncommon but respond well to standard anti-emetics such as chlorpromazine or metoclopramide. Attention to fluid balance during IFN&alpha; therapy is critical. Because flu-like symptoms may cause dehydration, which tends to exacerbate other symptoms, proper hydration (&ge;2 L daily) must be ensured. Non-caffeinated fluids are preferred for oral and IV hydration (500&ndash;1000 mL daily) and may be used in selected patients. Antidepressants are effective in reducing fatigue and depression; prophylactic administration of these agents has been investigated (Musselman et al., 2001). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow-Up</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>These patients will be seen by the attending medical oncologist monthly during the year of treatment, every 3 months for 2 more years and then every 6 months thereafter in the outpatient clinic. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (patient or population, intervention, comparisons, outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Question</strong></p>
<p>Should adjuvant interferon-alfa be offered to patients who have been rendered disease-free following the resection of cutaneous melanomas and who are at high risk for subsequent recurrence?</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE (1966 through December 2010), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Abstracts and proceedings, and CANCERLIT databases were searched. The search included practice guidelines, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and clinical trials. Search terms included: interferon or adjuvant interferon and malignant melanoma.</p>
<p>PubMed was again searched in 2013 for evidence on adjuvant interferon in cutaneous melanoma. The search term "melanoma" was used and results were limited to clinical trials, published between January 2012 and January 2013. Citations were hand-searched for studies pertaining to interferon therapy.</p>
<p>Using the same search strategy, four relevant articles published between January 2013 and January 2014 were identified during the 2014 update.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>Following a review of the evidence by the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team, no changes were made to the recommendations.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Cutaneous Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
