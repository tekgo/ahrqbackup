Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older discharged from any inpatient facility (e.g., hospital, skilled nursing facility, or rehabilitation facility) and seen within 30 days of discharge in the office by the physician, prescribing practitioner, registered nurse, or clinical pharmacist who had reconciliation of the discharge medications with the current medication list in the outpatient medical record documented.</p></div>
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Medications are often changed when a patient is hospitalized. Continuity between inpatient and on-going care is essential.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>No trials of the effects of physician acknowledgment of medications post-discharge were found. However, patients are likely to have their medications changed during a hospitalization. One observational study showed that 1.5 new medications were initiated per patient during hospitalization, and 28% of chronic medications were canceled by the time of hospital discharge (Beers, Sliwkowski, &amp; Brooks, 1992). Another observational study showed that at one week post-discharge, 72% of elderly patients were taking incorrectly at least one medication started in the inpatient setting, and 32% of medications were not being taken at all (Becker &amp; Maiman, 1975). One survey study faulted the quality of discharge communication as contributing to early hospital readmission, although this study did not implicate medication discontinuity as the cause (Williams &amp; Fitton, 1990; Wenger &amp; Young, 2004).</p>
<p>First, a medication list must be collected. It is important to know what medications the patient has been taking or receiving prior to the outpatient visit in order to provide quality care. This applies regardless of the setting from which the patient came &mdash; home, long-term care, assisted living, etc.</p>
<p>The medication list should include all medications (prescriptions, over-the-counter, herbals, supplements, etc.) with dose, frequency, route, and reason for taking it. It is also important to verify whether the patient is actually taking the medication as prescribed or instructed, as sometimes this is not the case.</p>
<p>At the end of the outpatient visit, a clinician needs to verify three questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Based on what occurred in the visit, should any medication that the patient was taking or receiving prior to the visit be discontinued or altered? </li>
    <li>Based on what occurred in the visit, should any medication be suspended pending consultation with the prescriber? </li>
    <li>Have any new prescriptions been added today? </li>
</ol>
<p>These questions should be reviewed by the physician who completed the procedure, or the physician who evaluated and treated the patient.</p>
<p>If the answer to all three questions is "no," then the process is complete.</p>
<p>If the answer to any question is "yes," the patient needs to receive clear instructions about what to do &mdash; all changes, holds, and discontinuations of medications should be specifically noted. Include any follow-up required, such as calling or making appointments with other practitioners and a timeframe for doing so (Institute for Healthcare Improvement [IHI], 2006). </p></div>
