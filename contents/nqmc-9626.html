Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of parents or guardians of children younger than 18 years of age identified as having sickle cell disease (SCD) who responded, on a scale of 1 to 5, "Satisfied (4)" or "Very Satisfied (5)" to the following survey question during the measurement year:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In the past 12 months, on a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied have you been with the care you/your child have received in the emergency room? (Response options: 1 [Not Satisfied at All], 2, 3, 4, 5 [Very Satisfied], N/A, Don't Know, Refused to Respond) </li>
</ul>
<p>A higher proportion indicates better performance, as reflected by high parent/guardian satisfaction.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Approximately 2,000 infants are born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States each year, a condition that occurs predominantly in people of African and Hispanic descent. SCD is a chronic hematologic disorder, characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S. From infancy onward, this hemoglobin variant can lead to an array of serious medical conditions. Because children with SCD are urged to seek care as soon as complications arise, many will visit an emergency department with time-sensitive issues such as infection, fever, and pain. Based on these encounters, patients with SCD and their families have direct and relevant experience to offer regarding care received. Parent surveys provide a valuable mechanism by which to gather and reflect the patient/caregiver perspective back to providers. Providers, in turn, can use this information to improve practices and better support their pediatric patients as they face a challenging, complex disease. Examples of possible practice adjustments include providing patients and families in the emergency department with realistic time estimates and detailed discharge instructions. There are no existing quality measures for assessing satisfaction of care in the emergency department for children with SCD.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Prevalence and Incidence</em><br />
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States (U.S.) (Kavanagh et al., 2011). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (2002) estimates that 2,000 infants are born with SCD in the U.S. each year. SCD affects 70,000 to 100,000 children and adults in the U.S., predominantly those of African and Hispanic descent (Hassell, 2010). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Pathology and Severity</em><br />
Vaso-occlusion (the sudden blockage of a blood vessel caused by the sickle shape of abnormal blood cells) is responsible for most complications of SCD, including pain episodes, sepsis, stroke, acute chest syndrome, priapism, leg ulcers, osteonecrosis and renal insufficiency (Steinberg, 1999). In addition, SCD can have hemolytic and infectious complications that result in morbidity and mortality in children with the condition (Kavanagh et al., 2011). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Burden in Daily Life</em><br />
The effect of SCD on children and families is significant; severe pain episodes and hospitalizations restrict daily activities and reflect negatively on school attendance and performance, as well as on sleep and social activities (Lemanek, Ranalli, &amp; Lukens, 2009; Alvim et al., 2005). Although medical management of SCD continues to improve over time, 196 children in the United States died from SCD-related causes between 1999 and 2002 (Yanni et al., 2009). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Cost</em><br />
In a study of health care utilization among low income children with SCD between 2004 and 2007, 27% of these children required inpatient hospitalization and 39% used emergency care during a year. Of these children, 63% averaged one well-child visit per year and 10% had at least one outpatient visit with a specialist (Raphael et al., 2009). Patients with SCD use many parts of the health care system, incurring significant costs. In 2009, mean hospital charges for children with SCD and a hospital stay were $23,000 for children with private insurance and $18,200 for children enrolled in Medicaid (HCUPnet, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, 2012). Kauf et al. (2009) estimate the lifetime cost of health care per patient with SCD to be approximately $460,000.</p>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability</strong><br />
<em>Data and Methods</em>. The testing data consisted of survey results from a sickle cell disease (SCD) health status assessment given to Michigan residents with SCD by the Michigan chapter of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America (SCDAA), in conjunction with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) in an effort to document unmet needs. While the SCDAA ultimately will complete these surveys from among all persons with SCD in Michigan, the results presented here are based on a convenience sample of the SCD population.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><br />
<em>Face Validity</em>. Face validity is the degree to which the measure construct characterizes the concept being assessed. The face validity of this measure was established by a national panel of experts and advocates for families of children with SCD convened by the Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC). The Q-METRIC expert panel included nationally recognized experts in SCD, representing hematology, pediatrics, and SCD family advocacy. In addition, measure validity was considered by experts in state Medicaid program operations, health plan quality measurement, health informatics, and health care quality measurement. In total, the Q-METRIC SCD panel included 14 experts, providing a comprehensive perspective on SCD management and the measurement of quality metrics for states and health plans. </p>
<p>The Q-METRIC expert panel concluded that this measure has a high degree of face validity through a detailed review of concepts and metrics considered to be essential to effective SCD management and treatment. Concepts and draft measures were rated by this group for their relative importance. This measure was highly rated: satisfaction with care in the emergency department received an average score of 7.7. A score of 9 represented the highest possible ranking. </p>
<p><em>Validity of Survey Data</em>. This measure was tested using parent survey response data linked to Medicaid administrative claims to gauge the degree to which respondents had emergency department visits during the measurement year. Overall, 183 parents/responsible parties completed the health status assessment survey; of those, a total of n=143 (78%) could be matched with Michigan Medicaid administrative claims. Among the n=143 of Medicaid beneficiaries, 60% had one or more claim for an emergency department visit during the measurement period.</p></div>
