<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission (MS) on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this appraisal was prepared by Warwick Evidence (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary and Critique of Submitted Clinical Effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p><em>Quality of Included Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)</em></p>
<p>The ERG has used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the quality of the included studies, and considers all trials to be of good quality (see Appendix 1 in the ERG report).</p>
<p><em>Network Meta-analysis</em></p>
<p>In absence of head to head comparisons of different flozins, the manufacturer undertook network meta-analysis (NMA). The manufacturer undertook this analysis to assess the effectiveness of empagliflozin as dual therapy with metformin, as triple therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea (SU), as triple therapy with metformin and thiazolidinedione (TZD) and finally, as an add-on to insulin. The main comparators were dapagliflozin 10 mg, canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg. However, in their network diagrams and tables, the manufacturer also reported studies related to other gliptins.</p>
<p>The manufacturer reported doing systematic searches to identify all the relevant studies. The outcomes analysed were change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline, change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline, change in body weight from baseline and safety which included hypoglycaemia (non-severe), hypoglycaemia (severe), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and genital infections. The outcomes were compared at two time periods 24 &plusmn; 4 weeks and 52 &plusmn; 4 weeks.</p>
<p><em>Summary of the Manufacturer NMA Results</em></p>
<p>The relevant data from NMAs for key outcomes (change in HbA1c, body weight and SBP) in the comparisons of interest (empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and sitagliptin) in dual, triple and insulin add on therapies have been summarised in Figure 11, Figure 12 and Figure 13.</p>
<p>Table 14 and Table 15 in the ERG report show the ERG's critical appraisal of the manufacturer's NMA. In general the overall methods in the NMA appeared to be of reasonable quality, but in those sections of results that the ERG had sufficient time to check there were errors that may be symptomatic of more general deficiencies. The clarity of NMA reporting was less good.</p>
<p>See Section 3 in the ERG report for additional information about clinical effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Model Implementation Cross-check</span></strong></p>
<p>The Empagliflozin Cost Effectiveness Model (ECEM) consists of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>An Excel front end that acts as a store of parameter values </li>
    <li>Visual basic (VB) code that forms the actual model </li>
    <li>An Excel back end for the outputting of the visual basic results </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Model Structure</strong></p>
<p>The main model structure is drawn from the equations of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS 68). See Figure 17 in the ERG report for an ECEM structure. The ECEM is a patient level state transition model. That is to say it models individual patients' transitions between health states using a fixed cycle length. The cycle length of the model is six months. This is apparently mainly to enable patients to switch treatments at the six month point. Note that the UKPDS 68 estimates annual probabilities of transitions. The calculation of the six monthly probabilities of the ECEM is not entirely in line with the calculation of the annual probabilities of the UKPDS 68, but the two are closely aligned.</p>
<p>The time horizon of the model is 40 years, the perspective is that of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) for costs and patients for benefits, and costs and benefits are discounted at an annual 3.5%.</p>
<p><strong>The Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>Three comparisons are made:</p>
<p>Dual therapy:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg plus metformin versus sitagliptin 100 mg plus metformin </li>
    <li>Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg plus metformin versus dapagliflozin 10 mg plus metformin </li>
    <li>Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg plus metformin versus canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg plus metformin </li>
</ul>
<p>Triple therapy: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg plus metformin plus SU versus metformin plus SU plus sitagliptin 100 mg </li>
    <li>Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg plus metformin plus SU versus metformin plus SU plus dapagliflozin 10 mg </li>
    <li>Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg plus metformin plus SU versus metformin plus SU plus canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg </li>
</ul>
<p>Add-ons to insulin regimens:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg versus metformin plus sitagliptin 100 mg </li>
    <li>Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg versus metformin plus dapagliflozin 10 mg </li>
    <li>Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg versus metformin plus canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg </li>
</ul>
<p>See Section 4 in the ERG report and the MS (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for additional information on the economic model.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary and Critique of Manufacturer Submitted Economic Evaluation by the ERG</strong></p>
<p><em>Cost-effectiveness Analysis (CEA)</em></p>
<p>The CEA uses a stochastic micro-simulation (the ECEM) to estimate the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin compared with SU, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites
'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the
appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups
representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health
professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review.
Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to
comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with
which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service
(NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the
area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not
asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review
published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'.
Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The
assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a
document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation
report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from
nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all
the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the
'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees
and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web
site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on
the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document
called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to
NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations
in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become
the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an
independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the
NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and
carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed the new cost-effectiveness model the company had provided. It noted that the new model was validated and had been used for previous National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed the new cost-effectiveness model the company had provided. It noted that the new model was validated and had been used for previous NICE technology appraisal guidance. The Committee concluded that the new model and associated results provided a suitable basis for decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>There were no specific Committee considerations on the key drivers of cost effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio [ICER])</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the very small differences in costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg) and its key comparators showed that empagliflozin was a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources as dual therapy in combination with metformin, triple therapy in combination with metformin and either a sulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione, and as an add-on treatment to insulin.</p></div>

    <li>Section 7(6) of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/259/contents/made" title="UK Legislation Web site">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013</a> requires clinical commissioning groups, National Health Service (NHS) England and, with respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the recommendations in this appraisal within 3 months of its date of publication. </li>
    <li>The Welsh Assembly Minister for Health and Social Services has issued directions to the NHS in Wales on implementing NICE technology appraisal guidance. When a NICE technology appraisal recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it within 3 months of the guidance being published. </li>
    <li>When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraph above. This means that, if a patient has type 2 diabetes and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that empagliflozin is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. </li>
