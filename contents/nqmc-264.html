Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure assesses the mean score for the questions in the "Tests" section of the Emergency Department Survey.</p>

<p>The "Tests" section is one of eight sections that comprise the <a href="/browse/DisplayOrganization.aspx?org_id=16&doc=407#data">Emergency Department Survey</a>. Mean section scores are reported for each section of the survey. In addition, an "Overall Facility Rating" score is reported.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ol>
<li><p>Patient satisfaction is both an <em>indicator</em> of quality of care, and a <em>component</em> of quality care.</p></li> 

<p>In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that</p>

<blockquote>
"...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them.  This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment 
positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims 
that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] <u>Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care</u>, Health Administration Press). 
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).</p>

<li><p>In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following:</p></li> 
  
<ul type="disc">
<li>Healthcare employee satisfaction and retention 
<li>Healthcare facility competitive market strength 
<li>Hospital profitability 
<li>Risk management (likelihood of being sued)</li></ul>
</li></ol>

Extent of Measure Testing

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Emergency Room Survey was developed in 1988 and was revised and renamed the Emergency Department Survey in 2001. A Client Advisory Committee (CAC), representing physicians, nurses, technicians and administrators, was 
formed to discuss changes, to review early drafts of prototype questionnaires, and to provide feedback throughout the revision process.  The revised survey was tested with the assistance of ten ED test sites across the U.S. The instrument was found to be psychometrically sound across a wide variety of tests of reliability and validity. Refer to the original documentation (Emergency Department Survey Psychometrics) for further details.</p></div>
