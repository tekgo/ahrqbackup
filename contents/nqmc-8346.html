<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with venous thromboembolism (VTE) treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) who receive heparin treatment for at least five days after the initiation of warfarin therapy and until international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than or equal to 2.0 for two consecutive days.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to prevent progression or recurrence of thromboembolic disease.</p>
<p>It is estimated that over one million patients are identified as having an acute venous thrombotic event in the United States annually. This includes patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and is estimated to result in more than 100,000 deaths each year.</p>
<p>Heparin/fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days after the initiation of warfarin therapy and until international normalized ratio (INR) is greater than or equal to 2.0 for two consecutive days.</p>
<p>The anticoagulant effect of warfarin is delayed until clotting factors already circulating are cleared. Although Factor VII has a shorter half-life in the blood (six to seven hours), peak anticoagulant activity is delayed for up to 96 hours until factors with longer plasma half-lives (II, IX and X) have cleared.</p>
<p>A goal INR of 2.5 (range 2.0-3.0) is recommended for the treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></div>
