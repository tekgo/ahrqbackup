Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Approximately 2 million persons in the United States have heart failure each year (Smith, 1985). These numbers will likely increase as the population ages. The literature suggests that hospitals have improved care for heart failure patients. In a study of 29,500 elderly patients in Oregon, the 3-day mortality decreased by 41% from 1991 to 1995 (Ni &amp; Hershberger, 1999).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs); and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) versus non-VA (Nationwide Inpatient Sample) using VA inpatient data (2004 to 2007) (Borzecki et al., "Trends," 2010).</p>
<p>A survey of hospital and system leaders (presidents/chief executive officers [CEOs]) that was conducted in the first six months of 2006 with a total of 562 respondents. Hospital-level data for these composite measures re produced by applying the Inpatient Quality Indicator (IQI) to the State Inpatient Databases (SID) of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The SID includes all-payer data on inpatient stays from virtually all community hospitals in each participating state (Jiang et al., 2008).</p>
<p>Using 1995 to 2000 data from New York state (n = 7,021,065), analysts compared mortality risk (odds ratio) for individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease (Laditka, Laditka, &amp; Cornman, 2005).</p>
<p>The developer restricted the analysis to 20 states for which HCUP SID were available. There were 1,601 nonfederal, urban, general hospitals in those 20 states. Over 300 hospitals were eliminated from the sample because of key missing variables in the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey of Hospital data, which was also used for this study, or because they had missing observations for some of the measures that were used. Thus, the sample consisted of 1,290 urban, acute-care hospitals for which complete data were available for 2001 (Laditka, Laditka, &amp; Cornman, 2005).</p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. VA-and VISN-level IQI observed rates, risk-adjusted rates, and observed to expected ratios (O/Es). The developer examined the trends in VA-and VISN-level rates using weighted linear regression, variation in VISN-level O/Es, and compared VA to non-VA trends (Borzecki et al., "Trends," 2010).</p>
<p>A t-test was used to determine the significance of differences in quality measures (Jiang et al., 2008). </p>
<p>Odds ratio (Laditka, Laditka, &amp; Cornman, 2005).</p>
<p>A likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that the coefficients on all of these variables were equal to 0 (lambda) = 35.3, p less than .01) (Laditka, Laditka, &amp; Cornman, 2005).</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. VA in-hospital mortality rates for congestive heart failure (CHF) mortality were unchanged over time. The IQIs are easily applied to VA administrative data. They can be useful to tracks rate trends over time, reveal variation between sites, and for trend comparisons with other healthcare systems (Borzecki et al., "Trends," 2010).</p>
<p>The existence of a board quality committee was associated with higher likelihoods of adopting various oversight practices and lower mortality rates for CHF measured by AHRQ's IQIs and SID (Jiang et al., 2008).</p>
<p>Among men, adjusted odds of death were greater for those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) for gastrointestinal CHF (+42 percent, p less than .0001). Among women, AD did not affect risks for most conditions although their risk for death from CHF was less than that for men with AD (Laditka, Laditka, &amp; Cornman, 2005).</p>
<p>The risk-adjusted mortality rate for CHF is not significantly associated with costs. The AHRQ QIs have the advantage of taking the multidimensional nature of hospital quality into account. As the coefficients on the AHRQ QIs show, measures of hospital quality can have conflicting effects on hospital costs. A single measure that combines these effects into one variable offers less insight into hospital performance than the outcomes for each measure (Laditka, Laditka, &amp; Cornman, 2005).</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Retrospective cohort study based on 2.07 million inpatient admissions between 1998 and 2000 in the California State Inpatient Database (Glance et al., 2008). </p>
<p>2004 to 2007 VA discharge and Vital Status files were used (Borzecki et al., "Comparison," 2010).</p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. The AHRQ IQI software was used to calculate risk-adjusted mortality rates using either 1) routine administrative data that included all the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes or 2) enhanced administrative data that included only the ICD-9-CM codes representing preexisting conditions (Glance et al., 2008).</p>
<p>The developer derived 4-year facility-level in-hospital and 30-day observed mortality rates and observed/expected ratios (O/Es) for admissions with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, CHF, stroke, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hip fracture, and pneumonia. Software-calculated O/Es were standardized to the VA population and compared O/Es and outlier status across sites using correlation, observed agreement, and kappas (Borzecki et al., "Comparison," 2010).</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. Without using Present on Admission (POA) data, for CHF 25% of hospitals classified as low-quality hospitals using enhanced administrative data were misclassified as intermediate-quality hospitals using routine administrative data. Despite the fact that the AHRQ IQIs were primarily intended to serve as a screening tool, they are being increasingly used to publicly report hospital quality. These findings emphasized the need (which the AHRQ QI have now adopted by incorporating POA data in the risk-adjustment) to improve the "quality" of administrative data by including a POA indicator if these data are to serve as the information infrastructure for quality reporting (Glance et al., 2008).</p>
<p>Of 119 facilities, in-hospital versus 30-day mortality O/E correlations were generally high (median: r = 0.78; range: 0.31 to 0.86). Examining outlier status, observed agreement was high (median: 84.7%, 80.7% to 89.1%). Kappas showed at least moderate agreement (k greater than 0.40) for all indicators except stroke and hip fracture (k = 0.22). Across indicators, few sites changed from a high to nonoutlier or low outlier, or vice versa (median: 10, range: 7 to 13). The AHRQ IQI software can be easily adapted to generate 30-day mortality rates. Although 30-day mortality has better face validity as a hospital performance measure than in-hospital mortality, site assessments were similar despite the definition used (Borzecki et al., "Comparison," 2010).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The predicted value for each case is computed using a hierarchical model (logistic regression with hospital random effect) and covariates for gender, age in years (in 5-year age groups), All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Group (APR-DRG) and APR-DRG risk-of-mortality subclass. The reference population used in the model is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) for the year 2007 (updated annually), a database consisting of 43 states and approximately 30 million adult discharges. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., hospital, state, and region). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population rate. Required data elements: Patient gender; age in years at admission; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) principal and secondary diagnosis codes. A limited license 3M APR-DRG grouper is included with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Quality Indicator (QI) Software.</p></div>
