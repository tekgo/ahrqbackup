Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based</strong>, <strong>Formal consensus</strong>, <strong>Informal consensus</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In adults treated with chemotherapy for a solid tumor or lymphoma, what factors should clinicians consider when selecting patients for primary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia with a colony-stimulating factor (CSF)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1</em>: Primary prophylaxis with a CSF starting in the first cycle and continuing through subsequent cycles of chemotherapy is recommended in patients who have an approximately 20% or higher risk for febrile neutropenia on the basis of patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors. Primary CSF prophylaxis should also be administered in patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy when considered appropriate. Consideration should be given to alternative, equally effective, and safe chemotherapy regimens not requiring CSF support when available. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Among adults treated with chemotherapy for a solid tumor or lymphoma, what factors should clinicians use to select patients for secondary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia with a CSF?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2</em>: Secondary prophylaxis with CSFs is recommended for patients who experienced a neutropenic complication from a previous cycle of chemotherapy (for which primary prophylaxis was not received), in which a reduced dose or treatment delay may compromise disease free or overall survival (OS) or treatment outcome. In many clinical situations, dose reduction or delay may be a reasonable alternative. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there circumstances in which CSFs should be considered for the treatment of neutropenia in adults with cancer?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therapy for Patients with Afebrile Neutropenia</span></p>
<p>CSFs should not be routinely used for patients with neutropenia who are afebrile. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therapy for Febrile Patients with Neutropenia</span></p>
<p>CSFs should not be routinely used as adjunctive treatment with antibiotic therapy for patients with fever and neutropenia. However, CSFs should be considered in patients with fever and neutropenia who are at high risk for infection-associated complications or who have prognostic factors that are predictive of poor clinical outcomes. High-risk features include expected prolonged (&gt;10 days) and profound (&lt;0.1 X 10<sup>9</sup>/L) neutropenia, age &gt;65 years, uncontrolled primary disease, pneumonia, hypotension and multiorgan dysfunction (sepsis syndrome), invasive fungal infection, or hospitalization at the time of fever development. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 4 </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>In what settings should CSFs be used to increase chemotherapy dose density?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4</em>: Dose-dense regimens with CSF support should only be used within an appropriately designed clinical trial or if supported by convincing efficacy data. Efficacy data support the use of CSFs with dose-dense chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of high-risk breast cancer and with high&ndash;dose-intensity methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (HD-M-VAC) in urothelial cancer. There are limited and conflicting data on the value of dose-dense regimens with CSF support in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and this cannot routinely be recommended at this time. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high for breast cancer and lymphoma, intermediate for urothelial cancer; Strength of recommendation: strong for breast cancer and lymphoma, moderate for urothelial cancer)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the role of CSFs as adjuncts to progenitor-cell transplantation?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.1</em>: CSFs may be used alone, after chemotherapy, or in combination with plerixafor to mobilize peripheral-blood progenitor cells. Choice of mobilization strategy depends in part on type of cancer and type of transplantation. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: strong; Strength of recommendation: high)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.2</em>: CSFs should be administered after autologous stem-cell transplantation (SCT) to reduce the duration of severe neutropenia. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.3</em>: CSFs may be administered after allogeneic SCT to reduce the duration of severe neutropenia. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the role of CSFs in the setting of acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6</em>: The Update Committee did not provide recommendations regarding the use of CSFs in adults with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 7</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Should CSFs be avoided in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7</em>: CSFs should be avoided in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy, particularly involving the mediastinum. In the absence of chemotherapy, therapeutic use of CSFs may be considered in patients receiving radiation therapy alone if prolonged delays secondary to neutropenia are expected. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 8</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there CSF recommendations that apply specifically to older adults and that differ from recommendations in younger adults?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8</em>: Prophylactic CSFs for patients with diffuse aggressive lymphoma age &ge;65 years treated with curative chemotherapy (CHOP-R) should be considered, particularly in the presence of comorbidities. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 9</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>How should CSFs be used in the pediatric population?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9.1</em>: The use of CSFs in pediatric patients will almost always be guided by clinical protocols. As in adults, a CSF is reasonable as the primary prophylaxis for pediatric patients with a high likelihood of febrile neutropenia. Similarly, a CSF as secondary prophylaxis or therapy should be limited to high-risk patients. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9.2</em>: For pediatric indications in which dose-intense chemotherapy is known to have a survival benefit, such as Ewing sarcoma, CSFs should be used to enable the administration of these regimens. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 9.3</em>: CSFs should not be used in pediatric patients with nonrelapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or nonrelapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who do not have an infection. (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 10</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are recommendations for the initiation, duration, dosing, and administration of CSFs?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em>: Recommendations for the administration of filgrastim, tbo-filgrastim, filgrastim-sndz, pegfilgrastim, and sargramostim are summarized in Table 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 11</span></strong>
<p><strong>Do CSFs differ in efficacy?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 11</em>: Pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, tbo-filgrastim, and filgrastim-sndz (and other biosimilars as they become available) can be used for the prevention of treatment-related febrile neutropenia. The choice of agent depends on convenience, cost, and clinical situation. There have been no additional data comparing G-CSF and GM-CSF since the 2006 update; therefore, there has been no change in the recommendation regarding their therapeutic equivalency. (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 12</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the role of CSFs in the treatment of radiation injury?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 12</em>: Current recommendations for the management of patients exposed to lethal doses of total-body radiotherapy, but not doses high enough to lead to certain death as a result of injury to other organs, include the prompt administration of CSFs or pegylated G-CSFs. (Type: formal consensus [by others], benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate)</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Computerized literature searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. The searches of the English-language literature published from October 1, 2005 to September 30, 2014 combined terms for colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), study designs of interest, cancer, and stem cell transplantation. Results of the database searches were supplemented with contributions from Update Committee members' personal files.</p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence on the basis of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Population: adults or children with cancer </li>
    <li>Intervention: granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) and granulocyte macrophage CSFs (GM-CSFs) used to prevent or treat febrile neutropenia among patients treated with chemotherapy, to allow the delivery of dose-dense chemotherapy, to mobilize stem cells for transplantation, or to treat radiation injury </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; or published in a language other than English. Excluded interventions were as follows: topical CSFs, CSFs as immunotherapy or vaccine adjuvant, perioperative CSFs, CSFs in allogeneic donors, CSFs for the prevention of mucositis, and granulocyte transfusion. Also excluded were studies in which the treatment arms received different anticancer drugs.</p>
<p>Outcomes of interest varied by clinical question and included neutropenia- and infection-related outcomes, progression-free and overall survival (OS), and outcomes related to stem-cell mobilization or transplantation.</p>

<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by one American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewer in consultation with the Update Committee Co-chairs. Data were extracted by one staff reviewer and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in Data Supplements 1 and 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study quality was formally assessed for the randomized controlled trials identified. Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer and included factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, etc. The risk of bias is assessed as "low," "intermediate," or "high" for most of the identified evidence.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Update Committee with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, pediatric oncology, community oncology, epidemiology and biostatistics, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Update Committee was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Update Committee met twice via webinar and corresponded frequently through e-mail. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Update Committee participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document, which was then disseminated for external review and submitted to the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)</em> for peer review and consideration for publication. All ASCO guidelines are reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Committee prior to publication.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software<sup>TM</sup>. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p>

<h3>
Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost Implications</span></strong></p>
<p>Although the 2006 Update Committee extensively discussed the cost of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), it recommended CSF use when the febrile neutropenia rate was approximately &ge;20% based on clinical impact alone, because of the consensus that reduction in febrile neutropenia itself was an important clinical outcome. Since the 2006 update, original data from randomized trials have been limited.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analyses of primary versus secondary prophylaxis with granulocyte CSFs (G-CSFs) have produced varying results. In a model that considered three different strategies (no primary prophylaxis, 10 days of filgrastim, or one dose of pegfilgrastim) among patients receiving a 21-day cycle of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone or prednisone (R-CHOP-21) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary prophylaxis was not cost effective from the perspective of a publicly funded health care system. Costs associated with no primary prophylaxis, filgrastim prophylaxis, and pegfilgrastim prophylaxis were Canadian $7,314, $13,947, and $16,290, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness for primary prophylaxis with filgrastim versus no primary prophylaxis was Canadian $5,796,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, far outside accepted bounds. In a United Kingdom&ndash;based model of cost among patients with breast cancer, the most cost effective strategy (primary prophylaxis, secondary prophylaxis, or no G-CSFs) depended on patient characteristics and risk of febrile neutropenia. Of the three types of G-CSFs evaluated, pegfilgrastim seemed to be more cost effective than filgrastim or lenograstim. A cost benefit may be more apparent in the United States, as a result of higher health care costs, but cost effectiveness will vary by factors such as the risk of febrile neutropenia.</p>
<p>Randomized trials have assessed the efficacy of reduced dosages or less frequent administration of prophylactic G-CSFs. A study in the United Kingdom randomly assigned 172 patients with breast cancer to primary prophylaxis with a G-CSF during all six cycles of chemotherapy or during just the first two cycles. Prophylactic G-CSF during only the first two cycles of chemotherapy was cost saving but resulted in a higher rate of febrile neutropenia than a G-CSF during all cycles (36% versus 10%, respectively). A reduced dose of lenograstim (50 &micro;g/body) was evaluated in a small cross-over study of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in Japan and compared favorably with a 75-&micro;g/ body dose of filgrastim. In the absence of more definitive data, the consensus of the 2015 Update Committee is that clinicians should adhere to current product labeling.</p>
<p>There do seem to be opportunities to improve G-CSF use in the community. The overuse of CSFs was one of the 2012 Americal Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Choosing Wisely recommendations: "Don't use white cell stimulating factors for primary prevention of febrile neutropenia for patients with less than 20% risk for this complication." To reduce CSF use in patients receiving low-risk chemotherapy regimens, one study group instituted real-time peer-to-peer consultation regarding pegfilgrastim use. Among patients receiving low-risk chemotherapy regimens, pegfilgrastim use decreased from 52 units in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 15 units in the third quarter of 2010 (71% decrease) with no adverse consequences.</p>
<p>Although questions remain about the cost-effectiveness of G-CSFs in certain settings, the 2015 Update Committee has reiterated the position that G-CSF prophylaxis should be driven by clinical considerations and not by cost. CSF use is recommended when the febrile neutropenia rate is &ge;20% based on clinical impact alone, because of the consensus that reduction in febrile neutropenia itself is an important clinical outcome. The 2015 Update Committee has recognized, again, that these are expensive agents with the potential for overuse. As stated, when alternative regimens are available that offer equivalent efficacy without the need for CSF support, these alternative regimens should be used.</p></div>

The information herein should not be relied on as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases.

Furthermore, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, because the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations are described as having high, moderate, or low confidence that a recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary.

ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information or for any errors or omissions. </li>
    <li>For adults with a solid tumor or lymphoma who receive chemotherapy regimens that carry a high risk of febrile neutropenia (&ge;20%), primary prophylaxis substantially reduces the risk of a serious treatment complication and is recommended for most patients. However, for many commonly used chemotherapy regimens, the risk of febrile neutropenia is &lt;20%, and more individualized decisions about colony-stimulating factor (CSF) use are required. The risk of neutropenic complications and the importance of primary prophylaxis will vary with factors such as age, comorbidity, and other treatment-related considerations. It is important that in addition to understanding the evidence-based benefits and other risks of treatment, patients learn about the risk of febrile neutropenia as part of routine chemotherapy education. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the <a href="http://www.asco.org/" title="ASCO Web site">ASCO Web site</a> and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (<em>JCO</em>) and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
