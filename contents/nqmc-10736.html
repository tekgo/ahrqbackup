Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, with a diagnosis of breast, rectal, pancreatic or lung cancer receiving 3D conformal radiation therapy who had documentation in medical record that radiation dose limits to normal tissues were established prior to the initiation of a course of 3D conformal radiation for a minimum of two tissues.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Identifying radiation dose limits to normal tissues is an important step in the process of care for patients receiving radiation therapy treatments. Although no specific data is available, in its practice accreditation reviews, the American College of Radiation Oncology has found that radiation dose limits to normal tissues are included in the patient chart less frequently than reviewers expected. While dose constraint specification is an integral part of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), it is not required for 3D conformal radiation therapy. Patients treated with 3D conformal radiation therapy are often subjected to dose levels that exceed normal tissue tolerance, and precise specification of maximum doses to be received by normal tissues represent both an intellectual process for the physician during radiation treatment planning, and a fail-safe point for the treating therapists. In most circumstances where facilities require specification of radiation dose limits to normal tissues prior to initiation of therapy, policies and procedures exist that prohibit exceeding those limits in the absence of written physician approval.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Recommendation Statements</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Breast Cancer</strong></p>
<p><em>Whole Breast Radiation</em>: Target definition includes the majority of the breast tissue, and is best done by both clinical assessment and computed tomography (CT)-based treatment planning. A uniform dose distribution and minimal normal tissue toxicity are the goals and can be accomplished using compensators such as wedges, forward planning using segments, IMRT, respiratory gating, or prone positioning (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2014).</p>
<p><strong>Chest Wall Radiation (including breast reconstruction)</strong></p>
<p>The target includes the ipsilateral chest wall, mastectomy scar, and drain sites where possible. Depending on whether the patient has been reconstructed or not, several techniques using photons and/or electrons are appropriate. CT-based treatment planning is encouraged in order to identify lung and heart volumes, and minimize exposure of these organs. Special consideration should be given to the use of bolus material when photon fields are used, to ensure the skin dose is adequate (NCCN, 2014).</p>
<p><strong>Rectal Cancer</strong></p>
<p>Radiation therapy fields should include the tumor or tumor bed, with a 2-5 cm margin, the presacral nodes, and the internal iliac nodes. The external iliac nodes should also be included for T4 tumors involving anterior structures.</p>
<p>Multiple radiation therapy fields should be used (generally a 3- or 4-field technique). Positioning and other techniques to minimize the volume of small bowel in the fields should be encouraged (NCCN, 2016).</p>
<p><strong>Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</strong></p>
<p>It is imperative to evaluate the dose volume histogram (DVH) of the planning target volume (PTV) and critical normal structures such as liver, kidneys, spinal cord, liver and bowel. While these limits are empirical they differ based on dose per fraction, total dose delivered, and disease status (adjuvant vs. unresectable). Studies have shown that the tolerability of radiation is largely dependent on PTV size/elective nodal irradiation, types of concurrent systemic/ targeted therapy, and whether conformal (3-D, IMRT, stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT]) vs. conventional radiation is used (NCCN, "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma," 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</strong></p>
<p>It is essential to evaluate the DVH of critical structures and to limit the doses to the spinal cord, lungs, heart, esophagus, and brachial plexus to minimize normal tissue toxicity. These limits are mainly empirical. For patients receiving postoperative radiation therapy (RT), more strict DVH parameters should be considered for lung (NCCN, "Non-small cell lung cancer," 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Small Cell Lung Cancer</strong></p>
<p>Normal tissue doses will be dependent on tumor size and location (NCCN, "Small cell lung cancer," 2012).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em></p>
<p>Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) Testing Project</p>
<p>Five practice sites representing various types, locations and sizes were identified to participate in testing the PCPI/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/American Society for Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO)-developed measures. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Site A: hospital, multi-practice sites in urban, rural and suburban settings; 21 physicians; average 9600 oncology/prostate cancer patient visits per month for medical doctor (MD)/nurse practitioner (NP) assessment, chemotherapy; submitted Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) claims for one measure and utilized a full-fledged electronic health record (EHR). </li>
    <li>Site B: physician owned private practice, suburban setting; 4 physicians; average 48 oncology/prostate cancer patients seen per day; submitted PQRS claims for one measure and utilized paper medical records. </li>
    <li>Site C: physician owned private practice, urban setting; 41 physicians; average 2500 oncology/prostate cancer patients seen per month; submitted PQRS claims for two measures and utilized a full-fledged EHR. </li>
    <li>Site D: academic, suburban setting; 9 physicians; average 240 oncology/prostate cancer patients seen per month; submitted PQRS claims for one measure and utilized paper and EHR. </li>
    <li>Site E: academic, urban setting; 14 physicians; average 250 oncology/prostate cancer patients seen per month; collected PQRS data on 3 measures and utilized a full-fledged EHR. </li>
    <li>The measurement period (data collected from patients seen) was 1/1/2010 through 12/31/2010. </li>
    <li>Chart abstraction was performed between 8/8/2011 and 11/3/2011. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em></p>
<p>PCPI Testing Project</p>
<p>Data abstracted from patient records were used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the measure. <br />
92 patient records were reviewed.</p>
<p>Data analysis included:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Percent agreement; and </li>
    <li>Kappa statistic to adjust for chance agreement. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Testing Results</em></p>
<p>PCPI Testing Project</p>
<p>N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval) <br />
Overall Reliability: 92, 98.9%, 0.935 (0.809-1.000) <br />
Denominator Reliability: 92, 100.0%, Kappa is noncalculable* <br />
Numerator Reliability: 92, 98.9%, 0.935 (0.809-1.000) </p>
<p>This measure demonstrates almost perfect reliability, as shown in results from the above analysis. </p>
<p class="Note">*Kappa statistics cannot be calculated because of complete agreement. Confidence intervals cannot be calculated because to do so would involve dividing by zero which cannot be done.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong></p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em></p>
<p>All PCPI performance measures are assessed for content validity by a panel of expert work group members during the development process. Additional input on the content validity of draft measures is obtained through a 30-day public comment period and by also soliciting comments from a panel of consumer, purchaser, and patient representatives convened by the PCPI specifically for this purpose. All comments received are reviewed by the expert work group and the measures adjusted as needed. Other external review groups (e.g., focus groups) may be convened if there are any remaining concerns related to the content validity of the measures.</p>
<p>The expert panel was used to assess face validity of the measure. This panel consisted of 31 members, with representation from the following specialties: oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, urology, gastroenterology, hematology, pathology, colon and rectal surgery, otolaryngology, and pain medicine.</p>
<p>The aforementioned panel was asked to rate their agreement with the following statement:</p>
<p>The scores obtained from the measure as specified will accurately differentiate quality across providers.</p>
<p>Scale 1-5, where 1=Strongly Disagree; 3=Neither Disagree nor Agree; 5=Strongly Agree</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em></p>
<p>The results of the expert panel rating of the validity statement were as follows: N = 17; Mean rating = 4.18.</p>
<p>Percentage in the top two categories (4 and 5): 82.35%</p>
