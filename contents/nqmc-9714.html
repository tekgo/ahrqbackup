Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients ages 40 to 75 years old with untreated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) greater than 70 mg/dL who are prescribed statin therapy.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are on appropriate medication management.</p>
<p>Due to the high percentage of the United States (U.S.) population that is diagnosed with diabetes and the effect diabetes has on other comorbidities, appropriate management will improve the patient's experience of care and the health of the population, reducing office visits, emergency department visits, and cardiovascular complications. Other related conditions will in turn reduce the total cost of care.</p>
<p>Appropriate medication management targeting glycemic control, hypertension, and lipid management is important for reducing morbidity and mortality, and improving long-term quality of life for patients diagnosed with T2DM. Lifestyle changes such as nutrition therapy, weight loss, increased exercise, and appropriate education and self-management strategies are pivotal to improved outcomes. Inadequate access to care for chronic disease management as well as the cost of medication can contribute to poor control of T2DM and associated cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
<p>The use of at least moderate-intensity statin therapy in persons between 40 and 75 years and an elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level with a diagnosis of diabetes has been shown to be effective. The only trial of high-intensity therapy in primary prevention was performed in a population without diabetes. High-intensity statin therapy reduces the relative risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events more than moderate-intensity statin therapy in patients with ASCVD. Because individuals with diabetes are at substantially increased lifetime risk for ASCVD events and death, similar to those who have had a previous ASCVD event, persons with diabetes with high estimated 10-year ASCVD risk are likely to benefit similarly from high-intensity therapy (Taylor et al., 2013; Macchia et al., 2012; AIM-HIGH Investigators et al., 2011; ACCORD Study Group et al., 2010; Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' [CTT] Collaborators et al., 2008; CTT Collaboration et al., 2010; Cannon et al., 2004; Collins et al., 2003). </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Diabetes is a chronic disease that afflicts approximately 26.9% of United States (U.S.) residents aged 65 years and older. 1.9 million are diagnosed with diabetes every year, and an additional 7.0 million go undiagnosed and untreated (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011). More than 1 in 5 health care dollars in the U.S. goes to the care of people with diagnosed diabetes, costing $245 billion dollars annually. </li>
    <li>The benefits of a multifactorial approach to diabetes care are supported by the results of the Steno 2 Study of 160 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and microalbuminuria. Multifactorial interventions achieved a 50% reduction in mortality and significant reduction in microvascular complications five years after ending a 7.8-year multifactorial intervention that achieved glycated hemoglobin (A1c) of 7.8%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 83 mg/dL, blood pressure (BP) 131/73, compared to a conventional group that achieved A1c 9%, LDL 126 mg/dL and BP 146/78 (Gaede et al., 2008). Results of this study are consistent with the need for reasonable blood glucose control with emphasis on blood pressure and lipid management. </li>
    <li>Hospitalized patients with diabetes suffer increased morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and other related hospital costs compared to non-hyperglycemic inpatients (Umpierrez et al., 2002). </li>
    <li>Hyperglycemia has been associated with increased infection rates and poorer short-term and long-term outcomes in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, post-myocardial infarction, and post-surgical settings (van den Berghe et al., 2001). </li>
    <li>There is a substantial increase in the prevalence of depression among people with diabetes as compared to the general adult population (Anderson et al., 2001). Depression impacts the ability of a person with diabetes to achieve blood glucose control, which in turn impacts the rate of development of diabetes complications (de Groot et al., 2001; Lustman &amp; Gavard, 2001). </li>
    <li>Sleep apnea is a prevalent condition in obese patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with significant comorbidities including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance. </li>
    <li>Up to 21% of patients with T2DM are found to have retinopathy at the time of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (Fong et al., 2004). Generally retinopathy progresses from mild background abnormalities to preproliferative retinopathy to proliferative retinopathy. </li>
