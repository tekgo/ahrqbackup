<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform a systematic literature review on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Assessment report. The Assessment report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Data relating to both study design and quality were extracted by two reviewers into an Excel spreadsheet. The two reviewers cross-checked each other's data extraction and where multiple publications of the same study were identified, data were extracted and reported as a single study.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The quality of the clinical effectiveness studies was assessed independently by two reviewers according to the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at York University's suggested criteria. All relevant information is tabulated and summarised within the text of the report. Full details and results of the quality assessment strategy for clinical-effectiveness studies are reported in Appendix 2 of the Assessment report.</p>
<p><strong>Methods of Data Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>The results of the clinical data extraction and clinical study quality assessment are summarised in structured tables and as a narrative description. An indirect treatment comparison of prasugrel with ticagrelor was planned.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 5 of the Assessment report for more information on clinical effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Strategy</strong></p>
<p>In the Assessment Group's (AG's) review protocol, data relating to both study design and quality were planned to be extracted by two reviewers into an Excel spreadsheet (Excel software, Henderson, NV, USA). It was also planned that all economic evaluations identified for inclusion in the review would be quality assessed according to the Drummond et al 10-point checklist. However, no studies were identified for inclusion in the AG's review.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Manufacturer's Submitted Model</strong></p>
<p>Refer to Table 16 (NICE reference case checklist) in the Assessment Report for an overview of the manufacturer's submitted model.</p>
<p>In summary, the manufacturers have submitted the same economic model that they previously presented during the original appraisal of prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention (TA182). However, some aspects of the submitted model have been updated in light of feedback generated during the original appraisal of prasugrel (TA182). These revised aspects are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Use of sensitivity analysis encompassing the entire population as opposed to a 'typical' patient profile </li>
    <li>Removal of the functionality which allowed the user to choose to model 15 months of treatment (as the licence is only for 12 months) </li>
    <li>Conduct of scenario analysis using the Evidence Review Group's suggestions for utility values, amended long-term relative risk of mortality and reduced incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction </li>
    <li>Use of the generic (reduced) price of clopidogrel </li>
    <li>Updated costs </li>
</ul>
<p>The model was developed with the principle of simulating the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial outcomes as closely as possible. There are two main phases to the model: the active treatment phase, which spans the duration of the clinical trial, and the post-treatment phase, which extrapolates outcomes and costs beyond events that took place during the treatment phase, up until death or lifetime horizon (base case 40 years). Within the trial period, there is an opening 3 day period, modelled using a decision tree, followed by 12 cycles, each of 1 month, up to 12 months. The transitions were time dependent. Long-term mortality was based on adjustment of population life tables to reflect prognostic implications of the events modelled over the short term. The model also permits some costs to accumulate after the end of the trial period.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 6 of the Assessment Report for additional description of the manufacturer's model.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions on the Evidence for Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer submitted an economic model similar to the model described in&nbsp;the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal guidance 182.</p>
<p>The Assessment Group developed a 2-phase economic model: a short-term statistical model of the data from the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and a long-term model projecting outcomes and costs at the end of the first phase up to a maximum of 40 years.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee heard from the Assessment Group that extrapolating the data to 5 years would provide a much more certain estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) than extrapolating the data to 40 years. The Committee agreed that, although the extrapolation of short-term clinical data over longer time horizons could only increase overall uncertainty, it is necessary in economic modelling and that long time horizons are generally preferable. The Committee concluded that the 40-year time horizon was the most appropriate for decision-making while acknowledging that there will be some uncertainty as a result of the extrapolation of data over the longer time horizon.</p>
<p>The Committee noted that neither the manufacturer nor the Assessment Group had included ticagrelor in their respective models.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>Not applicable as the Committee had no concerns about the health-related quality of life data used in either the manufacturer's or the Assessment Group's economic model.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>
<p>The ICERs for all 4 of the subgroups (ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] with diabetes, STEMI without diabetes, unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI] with diabetes, unstable angina and NSTEMI without diabetes) were lower than &pound;20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. For patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI and diabetes, prasugrel dominated (that is, it was more effective and less costly than) clopidogrel.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the estimated QALY gains for prasugrel over the 40-year time horizon for the STEMI without diabetes and the unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes subgroups were small (0.084 and 0.053, respectively) and that the difference in costs between prasugrel and clopidogrel treatment was also small (&pound;555 and &pound;248, respectively). It accepted that as a result, the cost effectiveness of prasugrel was highly sensitive to changes in key model assumptions. Therefore, the Committee considered the main driver of cost-effectiveness was which time horizon was considered to be most appropriate for decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the most plausible ICERs for 3 of the 4 subgroups were: &pound;1600 per QALY gained for the STEMI with diabetes group, &pound;6600 per QALY gained for the STEMI without diabetes group, and &pound;4700 per QALY gained for the unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes group. In the 4th subgroup (unstable angina or NSTEMI with diabetes), prasugrel dominated (that is, it was less costly and more effective than) clopidogrel.</p>
<p><strong>How Has the New Cost-effectiveness Evidence That Has Emerged Since the Original Appraisal (TA182) Influenced the Current Recommendations?</strong></p>
<p>The new cost-effectiveness evidence has not influenced the recommendations. There are differences in the cost-effectiveness results submitted during the original appraisal of prasugrel and in the current appraisal which are a result of the different economic models used. In particular, in the current appraisal both the manufacturer and the Assessment Group used the whole licensed population in their models, rather than the typical/median patient profile used in the model for the original appraisal. Also, in the current appraisal the Assessment Group used data from the CAPRIE trial in its long-term model rather than data from TRITON-TIMI 38.</p></div>

    <li>Section 7(6) of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013 requires clinical commissioning groups, National Health Service (NHS) England and, with respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the recommendations in this appraisal within 3 months of its date of publication. </li>
    <li>When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraph above. This means that, if a person has acute coronary syndromes and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that prasugrel is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. </li>
    <li>NICE has developed a <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA317/Resources" title="NICE Web site">costing statement</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) explaining the resource impact of this guidance, to help organisations put this guidance into practice. </li>
