<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 to 75 years of age with type 1 or type 2 diabetes whose most recent blood pressure reading is less than 140/90 mm Hg (controlled).</p>
<p>This measure is a component of the <a href="/browse/by-organization-indiv.aspx?orgid=8&amp;objid=48825" title="Comprehensive Adult Diabetes Care" target="_blank'">Comprehensive Adult Diabetes Care</a> composite measure&mdash;one of 6 different rates&mdash;looking at how well an organization cares for the common and serious chronic disease of diabetes. </p>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Diabetes is one of the most costly and highly prevalent chronic diseases in the United States (U.S.). Approximately 26.5 million Americans have diabetes, and seven million of these cases are undiagnosed. Complications from the disease cost the country nearly $245 billion annually. In addition, diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. (American Diabetes Association, 2013). Many complications, such as amputation, blindness, and kidney failure, can be prevented if detected and addressed in the early stages.</p></div>

Once NCQA establishes national benchmarks for accountable care organization (ACO) performance, all measures will undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomiol statistical analysis. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test.</p></div>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There are two ways to identify patients with diabetes: by medication data and electronic data indicating face-to-face services. The organization must use both methods to identify the eligible population, but a patient only needs to be identified by one method to be included in the measure. Patients may be identified as having diabetes during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year. </li>
    <li><em>Medication Data</em>:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><em>Pharmacy Data</em>: Patients who were dispensed insulin or oral hypoglycemics/antihyperglycemics on an ambulatory basis during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year (refer to Table ACDC-A in the original measure documentation for a list of prescriptions to identify patients with diabetes). </li>
        <li><em>Prescription Data</em>: Patients who were prescribed insulin or oral hypoglycemics/antihyperglycemics on an ambulatory basis during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year (refer to Table ACDC-A in the original measure documentation). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>Electronic Data</em>: Patients who met an of the following criteria during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year (count services that occur over both years)
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>At least two outpatient visits (Outpatient Value Set), observation visits (Observation Value Set), emergency department (ED) visits (ED Value Set) or nonacute inpatient encounters (Nonacute Inpatient Value Set) on different dates of service, with a diagnosis of diabetes (Diabetes Value Set). Visit type need not be the same for the two visits. </li>
        <li>At least one acute inpatient encounter (Acute Inpatient Value Set) with a diagnosis of diabetes (Diabetes Value Set). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Identify patients who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes (Diabetes Value Set), in any setting, during the measurement year or year prior to the measurement year and who meet either of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A diagnosis of polycystic ovaries (Polycystic Ovaries Value Set), in any setting, any time during the patient's history through December 31 of the measurement year. </li>
    <li>A diagnosis of gestational diabetes or steroid-induced diabetes (Diabetes Exclusions Value Set), in any setting, during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Value Set Information</strong><br />
Measure specifications reference value sets that must be used for HEDIS reporting. A value set is the complete set of codes used to identify the service(s) or condition(s) included in the measure. Refer to the <a href="http://store.ncqa.org/index.php/performance-measurement/hedis-2015.html?p=2">NCQA Web site</a> to purchase <em>HEDIS 2015 Technical Specifications for ACO Measurement</em>, which includes the Value Set Directory.</p></div>

Use automated data to identify the most recent blood pressure (BP) reading taken during an outpatient visit (Outpatient Value Set) or a nonacute inpatient encounter (Nonacute Inpatient Value Set) during the measurement year.</p>
<p>The patient is numerator compliant if the BP is less than 140/90 mm Hg. If there are multiple BPs on the same date of service, use the lowest systolic and lowest diastolic BP on that date as the representative BP. </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Organizations that use Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) Category II codes to identify numerator compliance for this indicator must search for all codes in the Systolic Less Than 140 Value Set, Systolic Greater Than/Equal To 140 Value Set, Diastolic Less Than 80 Value Set, Diastolic 80-90 Value Set, and Diastolic Greater Than/Equal To 90 Value Set and use the most recent codes during the measurement year to determine numerator compliance for both systolic and diastolic levels. </p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
The patient is not compliant if the BP is greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg, if there is no BP reading during the measurement year or if the reading is incomplete (e.g., the systolic or diastolic level is missing). </p>
