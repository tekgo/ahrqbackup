Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to efficiently identify children with ongoing physical, mental, behavioral or other conditions who also require a type or amount of health and related services beyond that required by children generally.</p>
<p>The CSHCN Screener is a five item, parent-reported tool which identifies children who currently experience one or more of five common health consequences: (1) use or need of prescription medication; (2) above average use or need of medical, mental health or educational services; (3) functional limitations compared with others of same age; (4) use or need of specialized therapies (occupational therapist [OT], physical therapist [PT], speech, etc.); (5) needs treatment or counseling for emotional, behavioral, or developmental problems. Any of the 5 health consequences must be due to a physical, mental, behavioral or other type of health condition which has lasted or is expected to last at least 12 months. The questions are designed to be self-administered or telephone administered as part of a parent/caretaker survey. The screener takes approximately one minute to administer for a single child and an average of two minutes to complete when screening all children in a household.</p>
<p>English and Spanish language versions of the screening tool are available. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) are an important population of interest for health care services, economic health analyses, and policy development and implementation. CSHCN often have limited access to health care or do not receive all needed health services because of their elevated need for health care due to having a wide range of chronic illnesses, disabilities and other health problems. Thus, early identification, follow-up, and potential case management are essential to improve their quality of life. Also, continuity and coordination of care and utilization of appropriate payment mechanisms cannot be ensured unless these individuals are accurately identified. Providing appropriate services based on early identification may reduce the cost of treating children with special needs. A single, approved standardized screening instrument to identify CSHCN required for Federal and State program planning and evaluation was developed to monitor CSHCN health status and provide quality of care as mandated in the Title V of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p>The CSHCN Screener was developed to reflect the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau's (MCHB) consequences-based definition of children with special health care needs: "Children who have special health care needs are those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally."</p>
<p>The CSHCN Screener tool focuses on the current consequences of chronic health conditions. The non-condition specific approach used by the CSHCN Screener identifies children across the range and diversity of childhood chronic conditions and special needs, allowing a more comprehensive assessment of health care system performance than is attainable by focusing on a single diagnosis or type of special need. In addition, the relatively low prevalence of most childhood chronic conditions and special health care needs often makes it problematic to find adequate numbers of children with a specific diagnosis or type of special need. A non-condition specific approach makes it possible in many cases to identify enough children to allow statistically robust quality comparisons across health care systems and/or providers.</p></div>

<h2>Evaluation of Measure Properties

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Over 36,000 cases of CSHCN Screener data were collected during development of the CSHCN Screener. Testing included administration in commercial and Medicaid managed care, Medicaid Fee-for-Service, and primary care case management populations. The Screener was also fielded in two national samples of households with children during pre-testing for the National Survey of CSHCN sponsored by the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau.</p>
<p>Results from the CSHCN Screener have been compared with the Questionnaire to Identify Children with Chronic Conditions (QuICCC-R) and the 3M Clinical Risk Groups (3M/CRG) clinical classification system, medical chart reviews and parental reports of their children's specific health conditions, service needs and utilization levels. Overall, the CSHCN Screener identified numbers of children commensurate with other epidemiological studies of special health care needs. The screener did not systematically exclude categories of children according to the type and/or severity of their health conditions, and exhibited a high level of agreement with other methods. Good internal psychometric properties of responses to the CSHCN Screener and minimal random measurement error of the Screener was identified on the study using data from 2005-2006 NS-CSHCN (e.g., Cronbach's coefficient &alpha; level greater than .80).</p>
<p>Since initial development of the Screener, over 1 million cases of screener data have been collected through the NS-CSHCN (735,357), NSCH (193, 995) and MEPS (84,020) and have been used to continuously reassess its performance and validity.</p></div>
