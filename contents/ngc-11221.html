Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: This document provides guidance to perioperative team members for positioning patients undergoing operative and other invasive procedures in the perioperative practice setting.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>Perioperative team members should provide care that respects the dignity and privacy of each patient during patient positioning (Standards of perioperative nursing, 2017). </li>
    <li>The perioperative registered nurse (RN) should conduct a preoperative patient assessment to identify patients at risk for positioning injury, develop a plan of care, and implement interventions to prevent injury. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should identify and provide the positioning equipment and devices required for the operative or invasive procedure (Fletcher, 2014; Penprase &amp; Johnson, 2014; Dybec, 2004). </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should select, clean, inspect, and maintain positioning equipment, devices, and support surfaces and should ensure they are repaired or replaced when damaged, defective, or obsolete (Chitlik, 2011; Patient positioning, 2011). </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should use operating room (OR) beds, positioning equipment and devices, and support surfaces correctly (Patient positioning, 2011). </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should identify potential hazards associated with positioning activities and should establish safe practices. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should position patients on surfaces that reduce the potential for pressure injury. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe positioning practices. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the supine or modifications of the supine position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the Trendelenburg or modifications of the Trendelenburg position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the reverse Trendelenburg or modifications of the reverse Trendelenburg position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the lithotomy or modifications of the lithotomy position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the sitting or semi-sitting or modifications of the sitting or semi-sitting position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the lateral or modifications of the lateral position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement safe practices when positioning the patient in the prone or modifications of the prone position. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement measures to reduce the risk for injuries when positioning patients who are pregnant. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should implement measures to reduce the risk for injuries when positioning patients who are obese. </li>
    <li>The perioperative RN should collaborate with the perianesthesia RN to identify patient injury caused by intraoperative positioning (Fletcher, 2014). </li>
    <li>The health care organization should maintain records of patient care related to patient positioning and organizational processes related to positioning equipment and devices. </li>
    <li>Personnel with responsibility for positioning patients should receive initial and ongoing education and complete competency verification activities related to patient positioning. </li>
    <li>The health care organization should develop policies and procedures for positioning the patient, revise them as necessary, and make them readily available in the practice setting in which they are used. </li>
    <li>The health care organization's quality management program should evaluate patient positioning. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic literature search of the databases Ovid MEDLINE&reg;, EBSCO CINAHL&reg;, Scopus&reg;, and the Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search was limited to literature published in English from 2008 through February 2016. At the time of the initial search, weekly alerts were created for the topics included in that search. Results from these alerts were provided to the lead author until September 2016. The lead author requested a supplementary search on eye protection and requested additional articles that either did not fit the original search criteria or were discovered during the evidence appraisal process. The lead author and the medical librarian also identified relevant guidelines from government agencies, professional organizations, and standards-setting bodies.</p>
<p>Search terms included <em>positioning, positioning injury, compression injury, shear, friction, pressure, interface pressure, pressure ulcers, pressure reducing, pressure relieving, positioning surfaces, support surfaces, positioning equipment, positioning devices, safety straps, OR table, OR bed, OR mattress, alternating pressure mattresses, procedure table, padding, foam, gel, viscoelastic, supine, Fowler/Semi-Fowler/beach chair, lithotomy, lateral, prone, Trendelenburg/reverse Trendelenburg, jack-knife/Kraske, </em>and<em> robotic</em>. Other subject headings and keywords were included to address specific positioning devices, alternative terms for positions, patient-monitoring indicators, and risk assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, and publication dates within the time restriction unless none were available. Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and literature on surgical smoke safety. Letters and editorials were excluded. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher-quality evidence was available, and literature outside the time restriction was excluded when literature within the time restriction was available.</p></div>

<h3>
Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In a nonexperimental study conducted in a university medical center in Canada, researchers calculated the cost of using the existing operating room (OR) bed mattress and supplemental padding compared with the cost of using a viscoelastic dry polymer gel overlay on top of the OR bed mattress. The researchers found that the use of the viscoelastic gel overlay during procedures lasting 90 minutes or longer decreased the incidence of postoperative pressure injury by 0.51% and resulted in an overall cost savings of $46 per patient ($38.23 in 2017 US dollars).</p></div>

<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A known patent foramen ovale may be a contraindication to the sitting or semi-sitting position because of the potential for a venous air embolism (VAE) to pass into the systemic arterial circulation. There is a risk for cerebrovascular insult with these positions, and this risk is magnified when the patient is hypotensive. There is a risk for poor venous return from the lower extremities and pooling of blood in the patient's pelvis in the sitting or semi-sitting position. </li>
    <li>The incidence of VAE is not well tolerated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and thus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be a contraindication to using the sitting position. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>These recommendations represent the Association's official
    position on questions regarding optimal perioperative nursing practice. </li>
    <li>No attempt has been made to gain consensus among users, manufacturers, and consumers of any material or product. </li>
    <li>Compliance with the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) guideline is voluntary. </li>
    <li>AORN's recommendations are intended as achievable and represent
    what is believed to be an optimal level of patient care within surgical
    and invasive procedure settings. </li>
    <li>Although they are considered to represent the optimal level of
    practice, variations in practice settings and clinical situations may
    limit the degree to which each recommendation can be implemented.</li>
    <li>There are a vast variety of surgical positions and of positioning equipment and devices, and it would not be possible to address them all in this document; therefore, the information in this guideline is limited to the most commonly used positions and positioning equipment and devices.</li>
