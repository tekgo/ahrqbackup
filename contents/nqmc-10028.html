Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the age-standardized acute care hospitalization rate for conditions where appropriate ambulatory care prevents or reduces the need for admission to the hospital, per 100,000 population under age 75 years.</p>
<p><em>Calculation Description</em>: (Total number of acute care hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions in patients younger than age 75 &divide; total mid-year population younger than age 75) &times; 100,000 (age-adjusted)</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Hospitalization for an ambulatory care sensitive condition is considered to be a measure of access to appropriate primary health care. While not all admissions for these conditions are avoidable, it is assumed that appropriate ambulatory care could prevent the onset of this type of illness or condition, control an acute episodic illness or condition, or manage a chronic disease or condition. A disproportionately high rate is presumed to reflect problems in obtaining access to appropriate primary care. </p></div>
