<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of recommendation (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak/conditional</strong>) and levels of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low</strong> or <strong>very low</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>In obtunded adult blunt trauma patients, the guideline authors conditionally recommend cervical collar removal after a negative high-quality cervical spine (C-spine) computed tomography (CT) scan result alone (see Figure 3 in the original guideline document). This <strong>conditional recommendation</strong> is based on <strong>very low-quality evidence</strong> but places a strong emphasis on the high negative predictive value of high-quality CT imaging in excluding the critically important unstable C-spine injury. This recommendation is further supported by the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other additional imaging. Adjunctive imaging after a high-quality CT scan increases the number of low-value diagnoses, places patients at risk for unnecessary treatment plans, puts patients with multiple injuries at risk by moving them out of the intensive care unit to the resource-limited MRI suite, and at best, results in the same clinical action of collar removal. However, the use of this approach may result in a nonzero rate of neurologic deterioration.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Study Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion criteria consisted of adult blunt trauma patients 16 years or older, who underwent cervical&nbsp;spine (C-spine) computed tomography (CT) with axial thickness of less than 3 mm and who were obtunded with any author-specified definition of this term (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score &lt;15, unconscious, intubated, altered mental status, unreliable examination, distracting injury, intoxication, or not meeting NEXUS guidelines).</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria consisted of those studies that did not specify axial CT slice thickness and those with axial slice thickness of 3 mm or greater, so as to eliminate outdated CT technique and/or equipment. Also excluded were case reports, newspaper articles, letters, comments, practice guidelines, news, editorials, legal cases, reviews, or congresses that contained no original data. However, to ensure the search strategy did not exclude any appropriate articles, the guideline authors manually searched the references of all included and excluded publications, and did not restrict the search by publication date or language.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions and Comparators</strong></p>
<p>Given the lack of randomized clinical trial data and near absence of complete cohort study designs, the guideline authors anticipated and allowed partial cohort and pre-post study designs. Thus, each patient underwent a C-spine CT that was read as normal and was then retested with the comparator adjunct imaging and/or physical examination. Study design issues among intervention and comparators precluded a quantitative synthesis (estimate of treatment effect, heterogeneity assessment, meta-analysis, or full quality assessment).</p>
<p><strong>Types of Critical Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>As per Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, outcomes were chosen by the team and rated in importance from 1 to 9 (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document), with scores of 7 to 9 representing critical outcomes. The critical outcomes were new neurologic change resulting in paraplegia or quadriplegia after cervical collar removal and identification of an unstable injury. The latter outcome measure was subcategorized into whether it was treated with an operation or an orthotic (e.g., cervical collar).</p>
<p><strong>Types of Secondary Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The secondary outcomes, in order of decreasing importance, were stable C-spine injury (subcategories, treated with operation or treated with an orthotic), post-clearance imaging, false-negative CT imaging result on re-review, pressure ulcers, and time to cervical collar removal.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sources</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors conducted a systematic search using the PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases with no restriction on study date. This search was last run on August 15, 2013, and the search terms are listed in the supplemental digital content (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Given the time elapsed between the initial search and the data extraction stage, as of May 14, 2014, eight additional recent articles were provided for additional full-text review.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Studies</strong></p>
<p>After completing the electronic literature search, two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, applying inclusion criteria. Any reviewer discordance was conservatively resolved by inclusion into the full-text phase. The resulting studies then underwent full-text review, again by two independent reviewers, to determine appropriateness for inclusion in the quantitative synthesis phase. Any disagreement at this stage was resolved by consensus between the two reviewers and, if necessary, the addition of a third reviewer.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Data Extraction and Management</strong></p>
<p>At each stage of the systematic review, all forms used by each reviewer were entered into Web-based DistillerSR (2014 Systematic Review and Literature Review Software from Evidence Partners) and exported into Microsoft Excel for table creation.</p>
<p>The following data was extracted: study author, study dates (as opposed to publication dates), population demographics (age, Injury Severity Score [ISS], Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score, and definition of obtunded), adjunct method following cervical spine (C-spine) computed tomography (CT), type of C-spine injury (bone, ligament, spinal cord, or intervertebral disc), stability of C-spine, and treatment provided for identified injury (if any). Sex or blunt injury mechanism subtype were not captured because of the literature deficits in plausibly linking these variables to any of the defined outcome measures. Given the overlap between patient factors and secular trends (e.g., institutional protocols, slice number, machine types), both associated with optimal spatial and contrast resolution for imaging of the C-spine, the imaging data collection was limited to axial thickness (in millimeters) for CT and Tesla strength for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The guideline authors also aimed to capture any recognized false-negative C-spine CT radiographic interpretations on either clinical or research reassessment, cervical collar complication (e.g., pressure ulcer), and time to cervical collar clearance. The term obtunded required an operationalized definition using the terms <em>Glasgow Coma Scale, altered, intoxicated, intubated, unconscious, and/or unreliable exam</em>.</p>
<p>Unstable injuries were identified primarily using the system delineated by White and Punjabi and the three-column model of Denis. C-spine instability required either a fracture or fractures involving contiguous columns or levels, bone misalignment (subluxations, listhesis, interspinous widening, or splaying), or single-level ligamentous injury involving all three columns. A priori, the committee consensus of clinical judgment was that a 3 of 1,000 rate (0.3%), an upper acceptable limit for a missed unstable C-spine injury. Spinal cord injuries included spinal epidural hematomas, subdural hematomas, cord edema, or cord contusions. Nonligamentous soft tissue injury was captured, when specified. If discrepancies existed among reviewed text and figures/tables, the former was prioritized.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias</strong></p>
<p>Given that the most consistent outcome measures reported were those of diagnostic accuracy (identification of stable or unstable injury), the guideline authors chose the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the quality of the included studies. The QUADAS-2 tool assesses four domains as follows: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and patient flow. Each domain was assessed in terms of risk of bias, and the first three domains were also assessed for applicability.</p>
<p><strong>Grading the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, inconsistency of results, imprecision, and publication bias were difficult to assess because of the study design limitations of pre-post partial cohorts, resulting in an inability to perform a meta-analysis across any outcome measure. The quality of the evidence was further reduced because of indirectness of evidence relative to our wide definition of <em>obtunded</em> (population), noncomparable institutional imaging protocols (intervention and comparator), and inconsistently reported and often unavailable outcomes. Publication bias was present, as there is at least one case report noting neurologic change after collar clearance with a negative C-spine CT result. Moreover, across multiple institutions, the guideline authors have encountered at least one case of neurologic change. Thus, the quality of evidence across all outcomes is very low.</p>
<p>For one of the critical outcome measures,&nbsp;the guideline authors rated up the quality of evidence from low quality to moderate quality for magnitude of effect, given the consistently high negative predictive value (100%) of a normal C-spine CT result for the finding of an unstable C-spine injury. Despite this, the overall quality of evidence across all outcomes remains very low because of the very low-quality evidence available for our most critical outcome, neurologic change after cervical collar removal (see Table 5 in the original guideline document).</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
    <li>The guideline authors acknowledge the weakness in data quality related to imprecision, publication bias, and indirectness of evidence as well as included study design limitations. It is possible that there is a Type II error in this systematic review because of the available literature that may be populated by underpowered studies. </li>
    <li>The guideline authors found the term <em>obtunded</em> to have widely differing interpretations. There were no clear definitions applicable to clinicians, and there were no measures of validity or interrater reliability. </li>
