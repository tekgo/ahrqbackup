<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a primary diagnosis of low back pain who did not have an imaging study (plain x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computed tomography [CT] scan) within 28 days of the diagnosis.</p>
<p>The measure is reported as an inverted rate (1 - [numerator/denominator]). A higher score indicates appropriate treatment of low back pain (i.e., the proportion for whom imaging studies did not occur).</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Electronic and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Electronic specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid specification.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Low back pain is a pervasive problem that affects two thirds of adults at some time in their lives. It ranks among the top 10 reasons for patient visits to internists and is the most common and expensive reason for work disability in the United States (U.S) (Jarvik &amp; Deyo, 2002). Back problems are second only to cough among symptoms of people who seek medical care at physician offices, outpatient departments and emergency rooms (Center for the Advancement of Health, 2000). </p>
<p>Back pain is among the most common musculoskeletal conditions, afflicting approximately 31 million Americans, and is the number one cause of activity limitation in young adults. For most individuals, back pain quickly improves. Nevertheless, approximately 15 percent of the U.S. population reports having frequent low back pain that lasted for at least two weeks during the previous year. Persistent pain that lasts beyond 3 to 6 months occurs in only 5 to 10 percent of patients with low back pain (Lawrence et al., 1998). According to the American College of Radiology (n.d.), uncomplicated low back pain is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. The majority of these patients are back to their usual activities in 30 days. </p>
<p>There is no compelling evidence to justify substantial deviation from the diagnostic strategy published in clinical guidelines, which indicate that for most patients with acute low back pain, diagnostic imaging is usually unnecessary. Although patients may have a perceived need for imaging studies, efforts to educate patients on appropriate indications for imaging are within a provider's capacity.</p></div>
