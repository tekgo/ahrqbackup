<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (Class <strong>I</strong>-<strong>IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>For this guideline, recommendations have each been categorized as 1 of 3 types: 1) preparticipation counseling recommendations; 2) recommendations related to assessment, diagnosis, and management of suspected concussion; and 3) recommendations for management of diagnosed concussion (including acute management, return to play [RTP], and retirement). The term experienced licensed health care provider (LHCP) refers to an individual who has acquired knowledge and skills relevant to evaluation and management of sports concussions and is practicing within the scope of his or her training and experience. The role of the LHCP can generally be characterized in 1 of 2 ways: sideline (at the sporting event) or clinical (at an outpatient clinic or emergency room).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparticipation Counseling</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>School-based professionals should be educated by experienced LHCPs designated by their organization/institution to understand the risks of experiencing a concussion so that they may provide accurate information to parents and athletes (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>To foster informed decision-making, LHCPs should inform athletes (and where appropriate, the athletes' families) of evidence concerning the concussion risk factors. Accurate information regarding concussion risks also should be disseminated to school systems and sports authorities (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suspected Concussion</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Use of Checklists and Screening Tools</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Inexperienced LHCPs should be instructed in the proper administration of standardized validated sideline assessment tools. This instruction should emphasize that these tools are only an adjunct to the evaluation of the athlete with suspected concussion and cannot be used alone to diagnose concussion (<strong>Level B</strong>). These providers should be instructed by experienced individuals (LHCPs) who themselves are licensed, knowledgeable about sports concussion, and practicing within the scope of their training and experience, designated by their organization/institution in the proper administration of the standardized validated sideline assessment tools (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In individuals with suspected concussion, these tools should be utilized by sideline LHCPs and the results made available to clinical LHCPs who will be evaluating the injured athlete (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>LHCPs caring for athletes might utilize individual baseline scores on concussion assessment tools, especially in younger athletes, those with prior concussions, or those with preexisting learning disabilities/attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, as doing so fosters better interpretation of postinjury scores (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Team personnel (e.g., coaching, athletic training staff, sideline LHCPs) should immediately remove from play any athlete suspected of having sustained a concussion, in order to minimize the risk of further injury (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Team personnel should not permit the athlete to return to play until the athlete has been assessed by an experienced LHCP with training both in the diagnosis and management of concussion and in the recognition of more severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Neuroimaging</strong></p>
<p>Computed tomography (CT) imaging should not be used to diagnose sport-related concussion (SRC) but might be obtained to rule out more serious TBI such as an intracranial hemorrhage in athletes with a suspected concussion who have loss of consciousness (LOC), posttraumatic amnesia, persistently altered mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale &lt;15), focal neurologic deficit, evidence of skull fracture on examination, or signs of clinical deterioration (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management of Diagnosed Concussion</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>RTP: Risk of Recurrent Concussion</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In order to diminish the risk of recurrent injury, individuals supervising athletes should prohibit an athlete with concussion from returning to play/ practice (contact-risk activity) until an LHCP has judged that the concussion has resolved (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In order to diminish the risk of recurrent injury, individuals supervising athletes should prohibit an athlete with concussion from returning to play/ practice (contact-risk activity) until the athlete is asymptomatic off medication (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RTP: Age Effects</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Individuals supervising athletes of high school age or younger with diagnosed concussion should manage them more conservatively regarding RTP than they manage older athletes (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Individuals using concussion assessment tools for the evaluation of athletes of preteen age or younger should ensure that these tools demonstrate appropriate psychometric properties of reliability and validity (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RTP: Concussion Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Clinical LHCPs might use supplemental information, such as neurocognitive testing or other tools, to assist in determining concussion resolution. This may include but is not limited to resolution of symptoms as determined by standardized checklists and return to age-matched normative values or an individual's preinjury baseline performance on validated neurocognitive testing (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>RTP: Graded Physical Activity</strong></p>
<p>LHCPs might develop individualized graded plans for return to physical and cognitive activity, guided by a carefully monitored, clinically based approach to minimize exacerbation of early postconcussive impairments (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive Restructuring</strong></p>
<p>Cognitive restructuring is a form of brief psychological counseling that consists of education, reassurance, and reattribution of symptoms. Whereas there are no specific studies using cognitive restructuring specifically in sports concussions, multiple studies using this intervention for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) have shown benefit in decreasing the proportion of individuals who develop chronic postconcussion syndrome. Therefore, LHCPs might provide cognitive restructuring counseling to all athletes with concussion to shorten the duration of subjective symptoms and diminish the likelihood of development of chronic postconcussion syndrome (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Retirement From Play After Multiple Concussions: Assessment</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>LHCPs might refer professional athletes with a history of multiple concussions and subjective persistent neurobehavioral impairments for neurologic and neuropsychological assessment (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>LCHPs caring for amateur athletes with a history of multiple concussions and subjective persistent neurobehavioral impairments might use formal neurologic/cognitive assessment to help guide retirement-from-play decisions (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Retirement From Play After Multiple Concussions: Counseling</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>LHCPs should counsel athletes with a history of multiple concussions and subjective persistent neurobehavioral impairment about the risk factors for developing permanent or lasting neurobehavioral or cognitive impairments (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>LHCPs caring for professional contact sport athletes who show objective evidence for chronic/persistent neurologic/cognitive deficits (such as seen on formal neuropsychological testing) should recommend retirement from the contact sport to minimize risk for and severity of chronic neurobehavioral impairments (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A medical research librarian assisted the panel in performing a comprehensive literature search of multiple databases to obtain the relevant studies. Articles were selected for inclusion and rated for quality independently by two authors. The search strategy is described in Appendix 4 of the data supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Only papers relevant to sports concussion or sports-related mild-traumatic brain injury (mTBI) published between 1955 and June 2012 were included. A study's quality (risk of bias) as it pertains to the questions was measured by the American Academy of Neurology's four-tiered classification of evidence schemes pertinent to diagnostic or therapeutic questions (see 'Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence' field). Class I and II studies are discussed in the guideline text and documented in the evidence tables (see appendix 6 of the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Class III studies are included in the evidence tables but may not have been mentioned in the text if multiple studies with higher levels of evidence are available. Class IV studies such as case series or meta-analyses have been excluded. Characteristics influencing a study's risk of bias and generalizability were abstracted using a structured data collection form. Each article was selected for inclusion and study characteristics abstracted independently by two panel members. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two panel members. A third panel member adjudicated remaining disagreements. Evidence tables were constructed from the abstracted study characteristics.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was synthesized and conclusions developed using a modified form of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process. The confidence in evidence was anchored to the studies' risk of bias according to the rules outlined in appendix 7 of the full-length guideline document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The overall confidence in the evidence pertinent to a question could be downgraded by one or more levels on the basis of five factors: consistency, precision, directness, publication bias, or biological plausibility. In addition, the overall confidence in the evidence pertinent to a question could be downgraded one or more levels or upgraded by one level on the basis of three factors: magnitude of effect, dose response relationship, or direction of bias. Two panel members working together completed an evidence summary table to determine the final confidence in the evidence (see appendix 7 in the full-length guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The confidence in the evidence is indicated by use of modal operators in conclusion statements in the guideline. "Highly likely" or "highly probable" corresponds to high confidence level, "likely" or "probable" corresponds to moderate confidence level, and "possibly" corresponds to low confidence level. Very low confidence is indicated by the term "insufficient evidence."</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>A multidisciplinary panel was formed, including representatives from child and adult neurology, athletic training, child and adult neuropsychology, epidemiology and biostatistics, neurosurgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and sports medicine.</p>
<p>The panel formulated a rationale for recommendations (see appendix 8 in the full-length guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) based on the evidence systematically reviewed, on stipulated axiomatic principles of care, and, when evidence directly related to sports concussion was unavailable, on strong evidence derived from the non&ndash;sports-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) literature. This rationale is explained in a section labeled "Clinical Context" which precedes each set of recommendations. From this rationale, corresponding actionable recommendations were inferred. To reduce the risk of bias from the influences of "group think" and dominant personalities, the clinician level of obligation (CLO) of the recommendations was assigned using a modified Delphi process that considered the following prespecified domains: the confidence in the evidence systematically reviewed, the acceptability of axiomatic principles of care, the strength of indirect evidence, and the relative magnitude of benefit to harm. Additional factors explicitly considered by the panel that could modify the CLO include judgments regarding the importance of outcomes, cost of compliance to the recommendation relative to benefit, the availability of the intervention, and anticipated variations in athletes' preferences. The prespecified rules for determining the final CLO from these domains is indicated in appendix 8 of the full-length guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]. The CLO is indicated using standard modal operators. "Must" corresponds to "Level A," very strong recommendations; "should" to "Level B," strong recommendations; and "might" to "Level C," weak recommendations.</p></div>

<h3>
Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. Must recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>should</em>. <em>Should</em> recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>may</em> or <em>might</em>. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that "must" be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that "should" be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that "might" be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes. </p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A <strong>Level R</strong> designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non&ndash;evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention</li>
</ul></div>
