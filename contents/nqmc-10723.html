<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Morbidity and mortality data related to influenza are often reported in conjunction with data regarding pneumonia. Using data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Gorina and colleagues (2008) found that, in 2004, pneumonia and influenza was the seventh most common cause of death for persons aged 65 and older in the United States. Almost 60,000 deaths in 2004 were caused by influenza and pneumonia and more than 85% of those were for the elderly (Gorina et al., 2008). Frail elderly are especially vulnerable and subject to complications of influenza. In the same year, there were approximately 123,000 deaths with influenza and pneumonia mentioned on the death certificate as a secondary cause of death (Gorina et al., 2008).</p>
<p>According to the CDC ("Influenza E-brief," 2008), more than 200,000 people are hospitalized in the United States each year as a result of complications from influenza. The average hospital stay was approximately 5.3 days at a cost of $6,900 per stay (Milenkovic, Russo, &amp; Elixhauser, 2006). Further, the death rate from influenza and pneumonia is nearly 130 times higher among persons aged 85 and older than among persons 45 to 54 years of age (Gorina et al., 2008). </p>
<p>Among adults aged 65 years and older, approximately 72.1% were vaccinated during the 2006 to 2007 influenza season, which is below the Healthy People 2010 target of 90% for this age group (CDC, "State-specific," 2008; Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], 2000). </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) currently uses Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 data to publicly report an influenza vaccination quality measure (QM) for nursing facility residents. The first quarter 2007 statewide averages for the long-stay population range from 75.9% to 96.5%, with an 87% national average (Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, 2007). According to the information currently available on Nursing Home Compare, the national average for the percent of long-stay residents given the influenza vaccine has increased to 90% (CMS, n.d.). </p>
<p>This measure is intended to encourage nursing facilities to focus on this important aspect of clinical care through the assessment of facility residents regarding the status of their seasonal flu vaccine immunization and to provide immunization as appropriate.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>According to the environmental scan conducted by the Colorado Foundation for Medical Care (2007), several expert organizations, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, target influenza prevention through annual vaccination of post-acute care facility residents and staff (Fiore et al., 2009). Influenza vaccine can be cost-effective and successful in preventing influenza. However, despite evidence demonstrating the efficacy of the influenza vaccine, coverage remains low among residents (Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, 2007). A study conducted in 2002 by Nichol and Goodman found that vaccination of healthy elderly adults was associated with a 36% reduction in hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2% to 39%), an 18% reduction in hospitalization for all respiratory conditions (95% CI: -6% to 37%), and a 40% reduction in death (95% CI: 14% to 38%). Vaccination was also associated with cost savings in all scenarios evaluated (Nichol &amp; Goodman, 2002). </li>
    <li>There is a demonstrated gap in performance in vaccination among adults age 65 years or older. Although the influenza vaccine can be successful in preventing the flu, vaccination rates remain low among nursing home residents (Gorina et al., 2008; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2008), due in part, to patient confusion, poor documentation of vaccination status, and availability of records from previous facilities (Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, 2007). Further, according to research, approximately 72.1% of the elderly were vaccinated during the 2006 to 2007 influenza season, which is below the Healthy People 2010 target of 90% for this age group (Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, 2007; Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], 2000).
    <p>In their analysis of quality measures using MDS data from the first quarter of 2006 (presented below), the University of Colorado found that the influenza measure could be reported for 86.5% of facilities and had a fair amount of variability across facilities in the rates of influenza immunization. The quality measure varied from 63.9% at the 10th percentile to 100% at the 90th percentile (Brega et al., 2008).</p>
    </li>
    <li>Racial segregation between nursing homes has been shown to be a major factor in racial disparities in the nursing home population, primarily for African Americans. In 2000, a study drawing on national MDS and Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) data found that two-thirds of all black residents were living in just 10% of all facilities (Smith et al., 2007). A 2002 survey of a stratified sample of 39 nursing facilities and 181 residential care/assisted living facilities in four states had similar findings (Howard et al., 2002). Facilities serving African Americans have demonstrated a lower level of quality care than those serving whites with lower staff to resident ratios and higher deficiency ratings (Grabowski, 2004). Minority groups in general and African Americans in particular have also had more limited access to nursing facility care than whites (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], CDC, 1997). Among adults age 18 and over, there are higher rates of seasonal influenza vaccinations in rural areas (53.7%) compared to urban areas (47.1%) but there is no published information specific to the elderly or to nursing facility residents (NCHS, CDC, 2009).
    <p>A search of PubMed did not reveal any recently published research studies specifically related to racial and ethnic disparities for influenza immunization in nursing facilities. However, differences in influenza vaccination between whites and non-white Medicare beneficiaries and Medicare beneficiaries in general have been documented (Flowers, Sinclair, &amp; Figueiredo, 2008). </p>
    <p>Bardenheier and colleagues (2004) conducted a study to identify nursing facility resident-specific characteristics associated with vaccination coverage and at baseline. Results of their bivariate analysis showed that residents with cognitive, psychiatric, or neurologic problems were more likely to be vaccinated than those without these conditions. Results of the multilevel analysis also showed that the presence of cognitive deficits was one of the strongest resident characteristics associated with receipt of immunizations, controlling facility variation (Bardenheier et al., 2004).</p>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A joint RAND/Harvard team engaged in a deliberate iterative process to incorporate provider and consumer input, expert consultation, scientific advances in clinical knowledge about screening and assessment, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) experience, and intensive item development and testing by a national Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) consortium. This process allowed the final national testing of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 to include well-developed and tested items.</p>
<p>The national validation and evaluation of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (NHs) (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA NHs (764 residents), regionally distributed throughout the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze inter-rater agreement (reliability) between gold-standard (research) nurses and between facility and gold-standard nurses, validity of key sections, response rates for interview items, anonymous feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment.</p>
<p>Analysis of the test results showed that MDS 3.0 items had either excellent or very good reliability even when comparing research nurse to facility-nurse assessment. In most instances these were higher than those seen in the past with MDS 2.0. In addition, for the cognitive, mood and behavior items, national testing included collection of independent criterion or gold-standard measures. These MDS 3.0 sections were more highly matched to criterion measures than were MDS 2.0 items.</p>
<p>Improvements incorporated in MDS 3.0 produced a more efficient assessment: better quality information was obtained in less time. Such gains should improve identification of resident needs and enhance resident-focused care planning. In addition, including items recognized in other care settings is likely to enhance communication among providers. These significant gains reflect the cumulative effect of changes across the tool, including use of more valid items, direct inclusion of resident reports, improved clarity of retained items, deletion of poorly performing items, form redesign, and briefer assessment periods for clinical items.</p>
