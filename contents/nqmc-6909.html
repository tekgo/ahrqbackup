<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure assesses the mean score for the four questions in the "Access" section of the Medical Practice Survey.</p>
<p>The "Access" section is one of six sections that comprise the <a href="/browse/by-organization-indiv.aspx?objid=26470">Medical Practice Survey</a>. Each patient has a score for every question that was answered. For each patient, a section score is calculated as the mean of all the question scores in that particular section. Similarly, for each patient, an overall score is calculated as the mean of that patient's section scores.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care and a component of quality care. </p>
<p>In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that:</p>
<blockquote>"...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' 'individual needs,' rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: 'Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately.' In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care... Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that '...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends' (from Press [2002], <em>Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care</em>, Health Administration Press). </blockquote>
<p>It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).</p>
<p>Patient satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: clinical quality (e.g., hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); chronic disease control; compliance; drug complications; quality of life; emotional health status; mental health; physical functioning; physical health status; post-surgery complications; post-surgery recovery times; risk-adjusted mortality rates; unexpected mortality; and work effectiveness (Clark, Drain, &amp; Malone, 2004).</p>
<p>In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction has been linked to the following: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; volume; physician satisfaction; patient's trust in provider; retention; employee satisfaction. </li>
    <li>Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in expenses; reduction in length of stay; reduction in complaints; reduction in malpractice claims; direct measures of financial performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, &amp; Malone, 2004). </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Not only has managed care grown since Press Ganey released its first Medical Practice Survey in 1990, but there has been an increase in the number of non-physician providers (such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants). Many physicians have found that they must participate in managed care plans not only to retain their existing patients but also to attract new ones. Group practices that deliver exceptional customer service are most likely to flourish in today's changing marketplace. Improved patient satisfaction increases word-of-mouth referrals and patients' compliance and has been linked to reduced staff turnover and malpractice costs. Improved patient satisfaction is also a predictor of mortality from cardiovascular disease, independent of care quality. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The revised Medical Practice instrument was tested by surveying approximately 9,000 patients from eight practices across five states during a seven-week period. Both single and multispecialty practices were included, serving urban and rural populations.</p>
<p>Patients at each site were selected randomly: half of these patients received the current Medical Practice questionnaire, and half received the revised questionnaire. Questionnaires were mailed to each sampled patient within 3-5 days of his/her visit. A mail-out methodology was chosen over hand distribution to eliminate selection and acquiescence biases. The test concluded with the receipt of 1,791 revised questionnaires. Practice-level response rates for the revised questionnaire ranged from a low of 17% to a high of 23%, with an average of 20% across all the pilot practices. The revised Medical Practice instrument was found to be psychometrically sound across a wide variety of tests of validity and reliability, as described in detail in the <em>Medical Practice Survey Psychometrics Report</em> (see also the "Companion Documents" field).</p></div>
