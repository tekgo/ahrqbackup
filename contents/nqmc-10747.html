Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of individuals 18 years of age and older who were not getting the recommended amount of physical activity and who now have the recommended level of physical activity, with at least one interactive contact specific to physical activity.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure offers a standardized definition of risk reduction for individuals who participate in health promotion programs. Specifically, this measure focuses on level of physical activity. </p>
<p>Several kinds of community interventions can impact physical activity levels. There is strong evidence that both individually-adapted health behavior change programs and efforts to provide social support for increasing physical activity in community settings increase physical activity and physical fitness among adults (The Guide to Community Preventive Services, "Individually-adapted," 2001; The Guide to Community Preventive Services, "Social support," 2001).</p></div>
