Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) who had electrodiagnostic (EDX) studies conducted, documented and reviewed within 6 months of initial evaluation for DSP.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Appropriate diagnosis is critical to ensuring that the patient receives the best possible treatment. Electrodiagnostic studies are one of the three main criteria used for the most accurate diagnosis of distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP). Electrodiagnostic studies provide a higher level of specificity for the diagnosis (Dyck et al., 1997; Feldman et al., 1994; Teunissen et al., 1997; Dyck et al., 1992). Electrodiagnostic studies are sensitive, specific, and validated measures of the presence of polyneuropathy (England et al., 2005).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines or consensus papers</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The combination of neuropathic symptoms, signs, and abnormal electrodiagnostic studies provides the most accurate diagnosis of distal symmetric polyneuropathy (England et al., 2005). </li>
    <li>Electrodiagnostic studies are recommended as part of the clinical research case definition since they are objective and validated tests of peripheral nerve function. Abnormal electrodiagnostic studies increase the likelihood of the presence of DSP and provide a higher level of specificity to the case definition. Electrodiagnostic studies should not be used alone to make the diagnosis since their sensitivity and specificity are not perfect (England et al., 2005). </li>
    <li>The simplified minimal requirements for Nerve Conduction Study (NCS) protocol is as follows:
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
        <li>Sural sensory and peroneal motor NCSs are performed in one lower extremity. Taken together, these NCSs are the most sensitive for detecting a distal symmetric polyneuropathy. If both studies are normal, there is no evidence of typical DSP. In such a situation, no further NCSs are necessary (England et al., 2005). </li>
        <li>If sural sensory or peroneal motor NCSs are abnormal, the performance of additional NCSs is recommended. This should include NCS of at least the ulnar sensory, median sensory, and ulnar motor nerves in one upper extremity. A contralateral sural sensory and one tibial motor NCS may also be performed according to the discretion of the examiner. Caution is warranted when interpreting median and ulnar studies since there is a possibility of abnormality due to compression of these nerves at the wrist or ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (England et al., 2005). </li>
        <li>If a response is absent for any of the nerves studied (sensory or motor, a NCS of the contralateral nerve should be performed (England et al., 2005). </li>
        <li>If a peroneal motor response is absent, an ipsilateral tibial motor NCS should be performed (England et al., 2005). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Electrodiagnostic studies are not required for field or epidemiologic studies, but the likelihood of diagnosis must be downgraded accordingly (England et al., 2005). </li>
</ul></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong></p>
<p><em>Prevalence and Incidence</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>DSP is the most common variety of neuropathy and a type of diabetic neuropathy (Ziegler, 2008; England et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>Peripheral neuropathy is estimated to affect more than 20 million Americans (The Neuropathy Association, 2010). The overall prevalence is approximately 2,400 (2.4%) per 100,000 population, but in individuals older than 55 years, the prevalence rises to approximately 8,000 (8%) per 100,000 (Martyn &amp; Hughes, 1997; England &amp; Asbury, 2004). Older people are among the top spenders on healthcare. They make up 13% of the U.S. population in 2002, yet they consumed 63% of health care expenses (Shaw et al., 2003). Improving the effectiveness of diagnosis and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages. </li>
    <li>Neuropathies affect up to 50% of patients with diabetes (Lin &amp; Quan, 2010). DSP affects at least one in four diabetic patients (Ziegler, 2008). Diabetes is one of the five major chronic conditions that affect 25% of the U.S. community population (Stanton, 2006) and amounted to more than $62.3 billion health care costs in 1996 (Druss et al., 2001). </li>
    <li>The incidence of DSP is 2% per year (Shaw et al., 2003). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mortality and Morbidity</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Neuropathies also cause great morbidity because the symptoms severely decrease patients' quality of life. The secondary complications of neuropathy such as falls, foot ulcers, cardiac arrhythmias, and ileus are significant and can lead to fractures, amputations, and even death in patients with diabetes (Lin &amp; Quan, 2010). </li>
    <li>Pain associated with diabetic neuropathy exerts a substantial impact on the quality of life, particularly by causing considerable interference in sleep and enjoyment of life (Galer, Gianas, &amp; Jensen, 2000). Despite this significant impact, 25% and 39% of the diabetic patients, respectively, had no treatment for their pain in two surveys (Daousi et al., 2004; Chan et al., 1990). </li>
    <li>Another complication in diabetic neuropathy is the development of foot ulcers, and some reports have estimated that this occurs in approximately 2.5% of patients with diabetes (Lin &amp; Quan, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Office Visits and Hospital Stays</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The distal symmetric sensory or distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy represents the most relevant clinical manifestation, affecting 30% of the hospital-based population and 25% of community-based samples of diabetic patients (Shaw et al., 2003). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Family Caregiving</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients describe pain-related interference in multiple health related quality of life (HR-QOL) and functional domains, as well as reduced ability to work and reduced mobility due to their pain. The substantial costs to society of DSP derive from direct medical costs, loss of the ability to work, loss of caregivers' ability to work and possibly greater need for institutionalization or other living assistance (Shojana et al., 2004). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A 1999 survey found that 8% to 9% of Medicare recipients have peripheral neuropathy as their primary or secondary diagnosis. The annual cost to Medicare exceeds $3.5 billion (The Neuropathy Association, 2010) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>DSP is often difficult to diagnose reliably. It is often misdiagnosed or erroneously associated as the side effect of another disease like kidney failure (The Neuropathy Association, 2010). Undiagnosed and untreated neuropathy may lead to disability and poor quality of life. Neuropathy needs to be diagnosed early to prevent complications, such as neuropathic pain or the diabetic foot. </li>
    <li>Since DSP is the major contributory factor for diabetic foot ulcers and the lower-limb amputation rates in diabetic subjects are 15 times higher than in the non-diabetic population, an early detection of DSP by screening and appropriate diagnosis is of utmost importance. (Boulton et al., 2004). This is even more imperative because many patients with DSP are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms. </li>
    <li>Neuropathic pain is often more difficult to treat than many other types of chronic pain. Patients with neuropathic pain have great medical co-morbidity burden than age- and sex-adjusted controls (Shojana et al., 2004). Data collected between 1988 and 1995 (derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's population-based Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [BRFSS], as well as the National Health and Nutrition Examination [NHANES] surveys) reveal significant quality gaps in the treatment of diabetes and in screening for diabetes-related complications (Lin &amp; Quan, 2010). Diabetics also do not receive appropriate screening measures: only 55% obtain annual foot examinations (Deeb et al., 1988). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disparities </strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is currently no consistent data that shows disparities between minorities and whites for diabetes-related neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease (Carter, Pugh, &amp; Monterrosa, 1996). DSP is more common in older adults. Older people are among the top spenders on healthcare. They make up 13% of the US population in 2002, yet they consumed 63% of health care expenses (Shaw et al., 2003). Improving the effectiveness of diagnosis and optimizing patient outcomes will become increasingly important as the population of the United States ages. </li>
    <li>No definite racial predilection has been demonstrated for diabetic neuropathy. However, members of minority groups (e.g., Hispanics, African Americans) have more secondary complications from diabetic neuropathy, such as lower-extremity amputations, than whites (Carter, Pugh, &amp; Monterrosa, 1996; Dorsey et al., 2009). They also have more hospitalizations for neuropathic complications. </li>
    <li>Men with type 2 diabetes may develop diabetic polyneuropathy earlier than women, and neuropathic pain causes more morbidity in women than in men (Aaberg et al., 2008). </li>
