Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patient visits for those patients aged 6 through 17 years with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) with an assessment for suicide risk.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Research has shown that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at a high risk for suicide, which makes this assessment an important aspect of care that should be assessed at each visit.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>The evaluation must include assessment for the presence of harm to self or others (Birmaher &amp; Brent, 2007).</p>
<p>Suicidal behavior exists along a continuum from passive thoughts of death to a clearly developed plan and intent to carry out that plan. Because depression is closely associated with suicidal thoughts and behavior, it is imperative to evaluate these symptoms at the initial and subsequent assessments. For this purpose, low burden tools to track suicidal ideation and behavior such as the Columbia-Suicidal Severity Rating Scale can be used. Also, it is crucial to evaluate the risk (e.g., age, sex, stressors, comorbid conditions, hopelessness, impulsivity) and protective factors (e.g., religious belief, concern not to hurt family) that might influence the desire to attempt suicide. The risk for suicidal behavior increases if there is a history of suicide attempts, comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g., disruptive disorders, substance abuse), impulsivity and aggression, availability of lethal agents (e.g., firearms), exposure to negative events (e.g., physical or sexual abuse, violence), and a family history of suicidal behavior (Birmaher &amp; Brent, 2007).</p>
<p>A careful and ongoing evaluation of suicide risk is necessary for all patients with major depressive disorder. Such an assessment includes specific inquiry about suicidal thoughts, intent, plans, means, and behaviors; identification of specific psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychosis, severe anxiety, substance use) or general medical conditions that may increase the likelihood of acting on suicidal ideas; assessment of past and, particularly, recent suicidal behavior; delineation of current stressors and potential protective factors (e.g., positive reasons for living, strong social support); and identification of any family history of suicide or mental illness (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2010). </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>According to a study analyzing the quality of health care in the United States, only about 25.8% of patients with depression had documentation of the presence or absence of suicidal ideation during the first or second diagnostic visit. 76.11% of those patients who have suicidality were asked if they have specific plans to carry out suicide (McGlynn et al., 2003). A 2003 study reviewed medical records to assess the degree to which providers adhered to depression guidelines in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care setting. Providers documented exploration for suicidal ideation in 57% of the records (Dobscha et al., 2003).</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a testing project in 2012 to ensure the Child and Adolescent Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Suicide Risk Assessment measure is reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator and denominator case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing electronic health record data. Parallel forms reliability was tested. Three sites participated in the parallel forms testing of the measure. Site A was a regional extension center comprised of a network of community health centers with 4,065 providers. Site B was a physician-owned private practice in an urban setting. Site C was a non-profit community mental health center with 5 psychiatrists, 30 therapists and 4 nurse practitioners.</p>
<p><strong>Measure Tested</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Child and Adolescent Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) - Suicide Risk Assessment </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from electronic health records were used to calculate parallel forms reliability for the measure.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing Results</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parallel Forms Reliability Testing (Site A, B and C)</span></p>
<p>There were 101 observations from three sites used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.32 demonstrates fair agreement between the automated report and reviewer.</p>
<p>Of the 101 observations that were initially selected, 97 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.52 demonstrates moderate agreement between the automated report and reviewer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval)</span></p>
<p>Denominator: 101, 96.0%, 0.32 (-0.17, 0.81)*<br />
Numerator: 97, 75.3%, 0.52 (0.37-0.67)</p>
<p class="Note">*This is an example of the limitation of the Kappa statistic. While the agreement can be 90% or greater, if one classification category dominates, the Kappa can be significantly reduced (<a href="http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/184/5/1391" title="American Journal of Roentgenology Web site">http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/184/5/1391</a>).</p></div>
