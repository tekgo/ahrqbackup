Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Nursing facility residents often develop infections (Nicolle et al., 1984; Magaziner et al., 1991; Finnegan, Austin, &amp; Cape, 1985; Jackson et al., 1992; Strausbaugh &amp; Joseph, 2000), and among these, urinary tract infections are the most common (Zimmer et al, 1986; Katz et al., 1990; Lee et al., 1992). Some residents who develop urinary tract infections develop blood infections, and 10 percent of these patients die within one week (Saint et al., 2006). Symptoms of urinary tract infections include fever, painful or difficult urination, increased frequency and urgency of urination, blood in the urine, lower abdominal or flank pain or tenderness, and deterioration in mental status (such as increased confusion). Using Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 data for April to June 2009, the national prevalence of urinary tract infections in nursing facilities was 9.7 percent, with a range from a low average of 5.0 percent in Alaska to a high average of 14.3 percent in West Virginia (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2009). The urinary tract infection quality measure is the only measure in the current measure set that addresses infections. Thus, the urinary tract infection quality measure is a very important indicator of how facilities prevent and manage infections. </p>
<p>In a clinical review of the nursing home quality measures using the MDS 2.0, a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) organized by the University of Colorado concluded that the urinary tract infection quality measure is a "valuable source of information for nursing homes" (Brega et al., 2007). The measure prompts facilities to examine their approach to perineal care and their general infection rate. These infections have the potential for significant morbidity and mortality (Nicolle, 1993; Nicolle &amp; SHEA Long-Term-Care-Committee, 2001).</p>
<p>Infections increase the use of medical care and costs. Since many urinary tract infections are related to catheters, this quality measure provides an additional incentive for the facility to monitor its catheter use (Gould et al., 2009). </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Prior analyses of disparities among nursing home residents with regard to infection are limited. Analyses of the distribution of residents by race suggest that non-white populations are not evenly distributed across facilities. When the total number of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) are broken down by the percentage of patients who are non-white, there is a large proportion of facilities that have non-white resident populations that are smaller than the national average (16.5% of United States [U.S.] population 60 and older [United States Census Bureau, 2012]). Half of facilities have 13 percent or fewer residents who are non-white. A quarter of facilities have less than four percent minority resident populations (RTI International, 2013). </li>
    <li>To examine whether facilities with higher percentages of non-white residents have different performance scores for long-stay urinary tract infection (LS UTI), analyses were completed comparing the performance of facilities based on their percentage of non-white residents. Facilities were sorted based on their percentage of non-white residents, and then divided into quartiles. Quartile 1 = 0 to 3 percent non-white (n=3,471); Quartile 2 = 3.1 to 13 percent non-white (n=3,376); Quartile 3 = 13.1 to 33 percent non-white (n=3,424), and Quartile 4 = 33.1 to 95 percent non-white (3,423). The percentile distributions of performance scores for facilities within these quartiles were then calculated and compared. Overall, there was little difference in the facility performance by proportion non-white residents. The mean for facilities increased as the proportion non-white residents decreased monotonically. Facilities in the quartile with the highest proportion minority residents was 4.97 percent, compared to the mean for facilities with the lowest proportion of minority residents at 6.86 percent (RTI International, 2013). </li>
    <li>To examine the potential for socio-economic disparities with regard to UTI, the developer examined the performance of this measure in facilities stratified by the proportion of residents who are Medicaid eligible, a limited measure of low socio-economic status. Specifically, facilities were stratified into two groups, facilities with greater than 75 percent of residents who are Medicaid eligible, and those that had less than 75 percent of residents who were Medicaid eligible. The mean for facilities with a higher proportion of Medicaid eligible patients was 6.00 percent, versus 7.07 percent for facilities with a lower proportion of Medicaid stays (RTI International, 2013). </li>
    <li>Although research suggests racial disparities in quality of care in nursing homes between African Americans and whites (Smith et al., 2007; Howard et al., 2002; Grabowski, 2004; Mor et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2006) and between Hispanics and whites (Fennell et al., 2010), no analyses have been conducted specifically examining racial disparities in nursing facilities with regard to urinary tract infections. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report on healthcare disparities (2012) reported higher rates of catheter associated UTI among Hispanic adult surgery patients compared to non-Hispanic patients in 2009 and 2010. Higher rates of UTI were also observed among female surgery patients. These observations are based on a different population than the current measure, so do not suggest that a stratified measure is warranted, but monitoring for disparities in nursing homes is appropriate. </li>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A joint RAND/Harvard team engaged in a deliberate iterative process to incorporate provider and consumer input, expert consultation, scientific advances in clinical knowledge about screening and assessment, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) experience, and intensive item development and testing by a national Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) consortium. This process allowed the final national testing of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 to include well-developed and tested items.</p>
<p>The national validation and evaluation of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (NHs) (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA NHs (764 residents), regionally distributed throughout the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze inter-rater agreement (reliability) between gold-standard (research) nurses and between facility and gold-standard nurses, validity of key sections, response rates for interview items, anonymous feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment.</p>
<p>Analysis of the test results showed that MDS 3.0 items had either excellent or very good reliability even when comparing research nurse to facility-nurse assessment. In most instances these were higher than those seen in the past with MDS 2.0. In addition, for the cognitive, mood and behavior items, national testing included collection of independent criterion or gold-standard measures. These MDS 3.0 sections were more highly matched to criterion measures than were MDS 2.0 items.</p>
<p>Improvements incorporated in MDS 3.0 produced a more efficient assessment: better quality information was obtained in less time. Such gains should improve identification of resident needs and enhance resident-focused care planning. In addition, including items recognized in other care settings is likely to enhance communication among providers. These significant gains reflect the cumulative effect of changes across the tool, including use of more valid items, direct inclusion of resident reports, improved clarity of retained items, deletion of poorly performing items, form redesign, and briefer assessment periods for clinical items.</p>
