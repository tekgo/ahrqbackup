<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Mettler et al. (2009) estimate that computed tomography (CT) scans account for 17% of total imaging procedures performed in the United States each year and 49% of the collective radiation dose from imaging procedures. Current advances in technology have resulted in several methods to reduce radiation dose for patients undergoing CT. Studies show that the use of CT dose optimization techniques can reduce radiation dose by 40% to 50% without sacrificing image quality or diagnostic ability (Ozdoba et al., 2014; May et al., 2014; Kalra et al., 2002). </p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and other references</strong>:</p>
<p>CT examinations should be performed only for a valid medical reason and with the minimum exposure that provides the image quality necessary for adequate diagnostic information (American College of Radiology [ACR], 2014).</p>
<p>Radiologists, medical physicists, registered radiologist assistants, radiologic technologists, and all supervising physicians have a responsibility for safety in the workplace by keeping radiation exposure to staff, and to society as a whole, "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) and to assure that radiation doses to individual patients are appropriate, taking into account the possible risk from radiation exposure and the diagnostic image quality necessary to achieve the clinical objective (ACR, 2014).</p>
<p>Facilities, in consultation with the medical physicist, should have in place and should adhere to policies and procedures, in accordance with ALARA, to vary examination protocols to take into account patient body habitus, such as height and/or weight, body mass index or lateral width. The dose reduction devices that are available on imaging equipment should be active; if not, manual techniques should be used to moderate the exposure while maintaining the necessary diagnostic image quality. Periodically, radiation exposures should be measured and patient radiation doses estimated by a medical physicist in accordance with the appropriate ACR Technical Standard (ACR, 2014).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
As imaging technology continues to advance, the United States healthcare system has seen an increase in both the type and frequency of imaging studies being performed. The increase in utilization of imaging studies is accompanied by a corresponding increase in cost and exposure to radiation for both patients and healthcare professionals. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the number of radiologic procedures performed in the United States showed a ten-fold increase while the annual per-capita effective dose from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures increased by 600% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, the number of computerized tomographic (CT) examinations tripled, while the number of ultrasounds nearly doubled (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine, and ultrasound) accounted for approximately 35% of all imaging studies (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the proportion of radiation exposure that is attributable to medical sources increased from 17% to 53% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, while CT scans only accounted for approximately 17% of all radiologic procedures performed in the United States, they accounted for over 65% of the total effective radiation dose from radiologic procedures (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, the estimated per-capita effective radiation dose for radiologic procedures in the United States was nearly 20% higher than the average for other well-developed countries (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic imaging was prioritized as a topic area for measure development due to a high level of utilization, rising costs, and the need for measures to help promote appropriate use of imaging and improve outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
More than 67 million CT scans are performed in the U.S. each year (Mettler et al., 2009). With the increasing number of CT scans being performed, the use of dose optimization techniques becomes more important than ever. As these techniques are relatively new, there is paucity of data related to their current implementation and use. However, one 2013 study by Vance et al. showed significant variability in the use of CT scans based on patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race, insurance status) and geographic location. These variations may result in disproportionate radiation exposure for some patient populations. With variability in the use of CT, care must be taken to ensure that dose optimization techniques are applied uniformly across patient populations to minimize excess exposure.</p></div>
