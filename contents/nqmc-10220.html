<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The current radiology information systems in hospitals generally do not collect or report radiation exposures and the medical imaging devices that communicate with radiology information systems do not currently forward data on the radiation dose received by a patient from each such test. As a result, physicians are uncertain of their patients' cumulative exposure and lifetime attributable risk (LAR), which is problematic when assessing, prioritizing and discussing the risks and benefits associated with their patients' clinical needs (Sodickson et al., 2009).</p>
<p>National Quality Forum's (NQF's) Safe Practices for Better Healthcare-2009 Update: A Consensus Report was prepared incorporating the National Priorities Partnership six crosscutting priorities. Safe Practice 12: Patient Care Information addresses the lack of care continuum by not communicating critical patient information such as medical history, diagnostic test results, medications, treatments, and procedures. The Safe Practice Statement addressing this topic reads as follows, "Ensure that care information is transmitted and appropriately documented in a timely manner and in a clearly understandable form to patients and to all of the patient's providers/professionals, within and between care settings, who need that information to provide continued care" (NQF, 2009).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and/or other references</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Core functional requirements for an Internet-based system for sharing medical records</span> (Flanders, 2009)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Methods to ensure privacy and confidentiality of data; </li>
    <li>Capability to move and store large data files (e.g., images) with the same efficiency and reliability as possible with small data files (e.g., text); </li>
    <li>Construction of registries, which contain "knowledge" of all fragments of medical information (and their physical location) from all sources for a given patient; </li>
    <li>An ability to match records and accurately reconcile patient identities without a common patient identifier; </li>
    <li>A means to regulate access to data and audit the access; </li>
    <li>A method for moving blocks of data from one location to another; and </li>
    <li>A method to aggregate and consume the data at the point of care. </li>
</ol>
<p>Optimal patient care requires that care providers and patients be able to create, manage and access comprehensive electronic health records (EHRs) efficiently and securely. The sharing of radiologic images has become a fundamental part of radiology services and is essential for delivering high-quality care. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)</span><br />
IHE is an initiative by healthcare professionals and industry to improve the way computer systems in healthcare share information. The IHE Radiology Technical Framework, defines specific implementations of established standards to achieve integration goals that promote appropriate sharing of medical information to support optimal patient care. The IHE Radiology Technical Framework includes various Integration Profiles that provide a convenient way for both users and vendors to reference a subset of the functionality detailed in the IHE Technical Framework.</p>
<p>The Cross-enterprise Document Sharing for Imaging (XDS-I) Integration Profile specifies actors and transactions that allow users to share imaging information across enterprises. This profile depends on the IHE IT Infrastructure Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS) profile. XDS for Imaging (XDS-I) defines the information to be shared such as sets of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) instances (including images, evidence documents, and presentation states), diagnostic imaging reports provided in a ready-for-display. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cross-Document Sharing Work Flow</span> (Mendelson et al., 2008)<br />
The basic workflow is as follows: a document such as an x-ray report is created and stored at the document source, perhaps an imaging center. In addition, a (redundant) copy is sent into the document repository for the affinity domain in which this imaging center is participating.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the x-ray report, the document repository registers it with the document registry for that affinity domain. The document registry ensures that the document is assigned to the correct patient by transacting with the patient identity source, which may be using the Patient Identifier Cross-Reference and Patient Demographic Query (PIX-PDQ) profiles to reconcile the varying demographic data and medical record numbers that different systems assign to the same patient. Sometime (perhaps even years) later, the patient is seen by another healthcare provider at a remote site. The healthcare provider wishes to read the prior x-ray reports. This remote site participates in the same affinity domain and is now regarded as a document consumer. As such, it may query the document registry as to the existence of the prior reports and query the document repository to obtain the reports. Again, patient identity is reconciled and confirmed using the patient identity source and the relevant IHE actors and profiles. This scenario can be expanded to describe the sharing of many kinds of healthcare documents. There are also slight variations permitted in which some of the actors can be placed either within the affinity domain centrally or at one of the sites at which documents arise.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Federal Register, Electronic Health Record Incentive Program</span> (Department of Health and Human Services &amp; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2010)<br />
While the Federal Register, Electronic Health Record Incentive Program is not an evidence-based clinical guideline, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act requires the use of health information technology in improving the quality of health care, reducing medical errors, reducing health disparities, increasing prevention and improving the continuity of care among health care settings. The Incentive program includes meaningful use objectives and associated measures that pertain to the use of EHRs to facilitate the availability and use of health information.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
The use of medical imaging has resulted in revolutionary advances in the practice of medicine. The increased sophistication and clinical efficacy of imaging have resulted in its considerable growth. Consequently, the evolution of imaging has resulted in a significant increase in the population's cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation and a potential increase in adverse effects including cancer (Amis, Butler, &amp; American College of Radiology [ACR], 2010; Amis et al., 2007). Although experts may not agree on the extent of the risks of cancer from medical imaging, there is uniform agreement that care should be taken to weigh the medical necessity of a given level of radiation exposure against the risks, and that steps should be taken to eliminate avoidable exposure to radiation (Amis et al., 2007; Center for Devices and Radiological Health [CDRH], 2010).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">High Impact Topic Area</span><br />
This topic was chosen for measure development because of the high costs associated with imaging studies and because these medical procedures are a significant source of radiation exposure. The following objective data support the degree of increase in the use of imaging studies and emphasize the importance in taking steps to help eliminate avoidable exposure.</p>
<p><em>Prevalence and Incidence</em> </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The average per capita exposure to ionizing radiation from imaging exams increased by about 600% from 1980 to 2006 in the United States (U.S) (Mettler et al., 2009; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements [NCRP], 2009). </li>
    <li>The largest contributor to this dramatic increase in population radiation exposure is computed tomography (CT). In 1980 fewer than 3 million CT scans were performed; in 2006, there were about 380 million radiologic procedures (including 67 million CT scans) and 18 million nuclear medicine procedures performed in the U.S. (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>The imaging study with the single highest radiation burden, accounting for 22% of cumulative effective dose, is myocardial perfusion imaging (Fazel et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, an estimated 19 million head, 10.6 million chest and 21.2 million abdominal and pelvic CT scans were performed accounting for 28%, 15.9%, and 31.7%, respectively, of the total number of CT scans in the U.S. (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>Currently, approximately 11% of CT examinations are performed on children, which could account for more than 7 million pediatric CT examinations per year in the U.S. (Mettler et al., 2000; Frush &amp; Applegate, 2004; Linton, Mettler, &amp; NCRP, 2003). </li>
    <li>The prevalence of CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use during emergency department (ED) visits for injury-related conditions increased from 6% in 1998 to 15% in 2007 (Korley, Pham, &amp; Kirsch, 2010). </li>
    <li>While CT utilization has decreased steadily since 2003 in pediatric facilities across North America (Townsend et al., 2010) the use of CT in children who visit the ED increased from 0.33 to 1.65 from 1995 to 2008 and occurred primarily at non-pediatric focused facilities (Larson et al., 2011). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Costs</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 2000 through 2006, total Medicare expenditures for physician imaging services increased from $6.7 billion to about $14 billion, an increase of 13% per year on average (U.S. Government Accountability Office [GAO], 2008). </li>
    <li>In 2005 imaging services represented an estimated 14% of 2005 spending included in the sustainable growth rate (SGR) calculation, but represented 27% of the total increase in such spending between 2004 and 2005. The majority of the growth occurred for advanced imaging (GAO, 2008). </li>
    <li>In 2006, advanced imaging, including CT and MRI, accounted for 54% of total Medicare imaging expenditures, up from 43% in 2000. This translates to an increase in Medicare spending on advanced imaging from about $3 billion in 2000 to about $7.6 billion in 2006 (GAO, 2008). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disparities</em><br />
There is variation according to age, sex, and health care market in the proportion and mean dose of patients undergoing medical imaging procedures. One study concluded that the proportion of subjects undergoing at least one imaging procedure was higher in older patients, rising from 49.5% of those who were 18 to 34 years old to 85.9% of those who were 60 to 64 years old. The study also found that women underwent procedures significantly more often than men, with a total of 78.7% of women undergoing at least one procedure during the study period, as compared with 57.9% of men (Fazel et al., 2009).</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
One retrospective cross-sectional study describing radiation dose associated with some of the most common types of diagnostic CT found variable radiation doses. The study found variability in the following exams: 1) routine chest exam without contrast, the CT effective doses ranged from 2 mSv to 24 mSv; 2) routine abdomen-pelvis, no contrast - CT effective dose ranged from 3 mSv to 43 mSv; 3) routine head exam - CT effective dose ranging from 0.3 mSv to 6 mSv (Smith-Bindman et al., 2009).</p>
<p>A central database established for collecting dose indices as a function of patient qualities (i.e., gender, age, size, etc.) and exam type (i.e., lateral lumbar spine, pelvis CT, etc.), would allow the relative range of radiation dose indices to be analyzed and compared against established benchmarks.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that between $3 and $10 billion are wasted in the U.S. annually on unnecessary or duplicative imaging studies. Duplicative imaging procedures could be substantially reduced with improved access to existing imaging data. Additionally, universal access to existing imaging studies to retrieve relevant prior images could improve diagnostic specificity for radiologists and potentially further minimize recommendations for follow-up studies (Monegain, 2009).</p></div>
