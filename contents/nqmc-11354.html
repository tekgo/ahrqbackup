<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of emergency department (ED) patients 18 years and older with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or chest pain  who received aspirin within 24 hours before ED arrival or prior to transfer.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The early use of aspirin in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) results in a significant reduction in adverse events and subsequent mortality. The benefits of aspirin therapy on mortality are comparable to fibrinolytic therapy. The combination of aspirin and fibrinolytics provides additive benefits for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ("Randomised trial," 1988). Aspirin is also effective in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (Theroux et al., 1988; "Risk of myocardial infarction," 1990). National guidelines strongly recommend early aspirin for patients hospitalized with AMI (Antman et al., 2008; Wright et al., 2011).</p></div>
