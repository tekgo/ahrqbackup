Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The MEDLINE (Ovid) (1995 through July Week 1 2012) database was searched on July 17, 2012 and updated on August 14, 2013. The search strategy for MEDLINE is shown in Appendix 1 of the original guideline. Search terms for stem cell transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation were combined, and articles that also included graft-versus-host disease outcomes where photopheresis was administered were retained. As it was expected that there would be little indexed evidence, no restrictions were made based on publication date.</p>
<p>Relevant articles and abstracts were selected and reviewed by two reviewers, and the reference lists from these sources were searched for additional trials. Personal files were also searched.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria</strong></p>
<p><em>Inclusion Criteria</em></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in this systematic review of the evidence if they were published full-report articles or published meeting abstracts of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Studies that reported on outcomes of extra-corporeal photopheresis administered for either acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease for patients of all ages following allogeneic stem cell transplantation </li>
    <li>One of the following publication types or study designs: practice guidelines with systematic review, systematic reviews (with meta-analyses), systematic reviews (without meta-analyses), randomized phase III trials, randomized phase II trials, or other comparative studies. </li>
</ol>
<p>No specific outcomes were required, as long as the study met the two points above.</p>
<p><em>Exclusion Criteria</em></p>
<p>Studies were excluded if they were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Letters, comments, books, notes, or editorial publication types. </li>
    <li>Articles published in a language other than English, due to financial considerations for translation. </li>
    <li>Reported on fewer than five patients. </li>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Synthesizing the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>When clinically homogeneous results from two or more trials were available, a meta-analysis would be conducted using the Review Manager software (RevMan 4.2) available from the Cochrane Collaboration. For time-to-event outcomes, hazard ratios (HRs), rather than the number of events at a certain time point, would be the preferred statistic for meta-analysis, and would be used as reported. If the HR and/or its standard error were not reported, they would be derived from other information reported in the study, if possible, using the methods described by Parmar et al. For all outcomes, the generic inverse variance model with random effects, or other appropriate random effects models in (the software used) would be used.</p>
<p>Statistical heterogeneity would be calculated using the &chi;<sup>2</sup> test for heterogeneity and the I<sup>2</sup> percentage. A probability level for the &chi;<sup>2</sup> statistic less than or equal to 10% (p&le;0.10) and/or an I<sup>2</sup> greater than 50% would be considered indicative of statistical heterogeneity.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Study Quality</strong></p>
<p>For systematic reviews that would be used as the sole evidence base for our recommendations, the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool would be used to assess quality. For Clinical Practice Guidelines, the Assessment of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument would be used to assess quality. However, because of the time and effort necessary to properly implement the AGREE II instrument, it would be used only if adaptation of the recommendations was considered feasible by the working group given the nature and coverage of the guideline and an informal assessment of the guideline's methods. Where recommendations from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were not adapted, the evidence base in those CPGs would be informally assessed for completeness, and any relevant evidence within would be considered as a basis for recommendations in this report. Any meta-analysis would be assessed for quality using similar criteria as used for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where appropriate. RCTs would be assessed for quality by examining the following seven criteria: the method of randomization, reporting of blinding, the power and sample size calculation, length of follow-up, reporting details of the statistical analysis, reporting on withdrawals to treatment and other losses to follow-up, and reporting on the sources of funding for the research. Comparative, but non-randomized, evidence would be assessed according to full reporting of the patient selection criteria, the interventions each patient received, all relevant outcomes, and the source of funding.</p></div>

Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>One study detected a statistically significant difference in response rates in favour of extra-corporeal photopheresis (ECP) over conventional corticosteroid treatment (40% vs. 10%; p=0.002). Similarly, another study reported a significant increase in the overall response rate associated with EPC when compared to conventional treatment (26% vs. 8%; p=0.04). </li>
    <li>One study reported on quality-of-life outcomes, with a significant benefit being detected with ECP treatment compared with conventional treatment (ECP: 19% vs. control: 2.5%; p=0.01). </li>
    <li>A randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported on total skin scores, eye, oral, and joint changes associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and adverse events. Significant differences were only detected in eye GVHD, which showed an improvement associated with ECP compared with conventional treatment (ECP: 30% vs. control: 7%; p=0.04). </li>
    <li>A case series reported on changes from baseline scores after 6 months for cutaneous, hepatic, pulmonary, mucosal, and neuromuscular chronic GVHD (cGVHD), and significant improvements were detected for cutaneous cGVHD scores only (baseline: 89% [skin median score: 131, 132] vs. 6 months: 52% [skin median score: 61]; p=0.003). </li>
