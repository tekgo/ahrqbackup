Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Obinutuzumab, in combination with chlorambucil, is recommended as an option for adults with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who have comorbidities that make full-dose fludarabine-based therapy unsuitable for them, only if:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Bendamustine-based therapy is not suitable and </li>
    <li>The company provides obinutuzumab with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme </li>
</ul>
<p>People whose treatment with obinutuzumab is not recommended in this National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance, but was started within the National Health Service (NHS) before this guidance was published, should be able to continue treatment until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop.</p></div>

<p><em>Searches</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer provided detailed information on the search strategy. The database search strategies (as included in the manufacturer submission) are reproduced in Appendix 1 of the ERG report. In summary, searches were carried out in the following databases:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>MEDLINE (<a href="http://www.medline.com/" title="MEDLINE">http://www.medline.com</a>) </li>
    <li>EMBASE (<a href="http://www.elsevier.com/solutions/embase" title="EMBASE">http://www.elsevier.com/solutions/embase</a>) </li>
    <li>PubMed (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" title="PubMed" target="_blank">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>) </li>
    <li>The Cochrane Library </li>
</ul>
<p>The Web sites of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the American Society of Haematology (ASH) and the European Haematology Association (EHA) were also searched for conference proceedings.</p>
<p>The searches were carried out in April 2014. The database searches combine free-text and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for "chronic lymphocytic leukaemia" and "Obinutuzumab". A variety of synonyms are used to ensure an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity. A suitable clinical trials filter is applied to the MEDLINE and EMBASE searches. All searches are date limited from 1992 to April 2014. The choice of databases is appropriate for the topic and the translation of search terms and syntax for each database is accurate.</p>

<p><strong>Manufacturer's Review of Cost-effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p><em>Search Strategy</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer provided detailed information on the search strategy. In summary, searches were carried out in the following bibliographic databases:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>EMBASE (ProQuest) </li>
    <li>EMBASE Alert (ProQuest) </li>
    <li>MEDLINE (ProQuest) </li>
    <li>National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) </li>
    <li>EconLit (searched via the American Economic Association Web site) </li>
</ul>
<p>The searches were run in May 2014. They combine free-text terms for "chronic lymphocytic leukemia" (American English spelling only) and free-text and MeSH terms for methods of cost-effectiveness analysis. The results are date limited from 1992 to May 2014.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ERG Comment on Search Strategy</span></p>
<p>The search strategy uses a variety of synonyms to ensure an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity. The lack of the UK English spelling for "leukemia" is a weakness. However, the searches were re-run by ERG's information specialist with the UK English spelling and no additional studies were retrieved, i.e., the number of hits when searching with and without the UK English spelling of "leukemia" is the same.</p>
<p>The term "lymphocytic" is spelt "lymphocitic" in the MEDLINE and EMBASE search strategies. The ERG raised this as a clarification question and the manufacturer responded by sending a revised appendix with a note that the spelling had been corrected. However, the spelling error remains in the revised appendix. The ERG re-ran the searches with the correct spelling and no additional studies were retrieved, i.e., the number of hits when searching with and without the correct spelling of "lymphocytic" is the same. As such, the error does not compromise the quality of the searches.</p>
<p>The translations of the ProQuest (i.e., MEDLINE and EMBASE) search strategies for NHS EED and EconLit are not equivalent to the ProQuest searches but they do contain the same concepts and are appropriate for the topic.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by Peninsula Technology Assessment group (PenTAG) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>

<p><strong>Critique of Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>The submission explains the processes used in study selection and data extraction which is in line with the standard review process. The screening of the literature was performed by one reviewer and inclusion and exclusion criteria were verified by a second reviewer. Any disputes were resolved by a third party.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) was included. Details of the manufacturer's critical appraisal of Study CLL11, alongside the ERG's critique, can be seen in Table 10 of the ERG report. The critical appraisal was performed using the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) assessment criteria for risk of bias in RCTs.</p>
<p><strong>Description and Critique of Statistical Approach</strong></p>
<p><em>Statistical Analysis: Primary Endpoints</em></p>
<p>The statistical analysis of the primary data was performed from a clinical data cut-off on May 9th 2013.</p>
<p>Adjustments for multiplicity were done using a three-arm closed-test procedure. The first test was for any difference between the three treatment groups at an &alpha;=5%. If the null hypothesis of equal distributions for all three groups was rejected, pairwise tests for each of the three hypotheses (obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil versus chlorambucil alone, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil versus rituximab plus chlorambucil, and rituximab plus chlorambucil versus chlorambucil alone) were enabled at the 5% alpha level without &alpha;-inflation. The closed test procedure was conducted separately for the investigator and independent review committee (IRC) assessed progression-free survival (PFS).</p>
<p>Treatment comparison was based on PFS using a two-sided stratified (by Binet Stage at baseline) log-rank test. A two-sided non-stratified log-rank test was done to confirm the primary analysis. Median PFS and the 95% confidence limits were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival methodology.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Analysis: Secondary Endpoints</em></p>
<p>No adjustment for multiplicity was made for secondary endpoints: all were tested using a two-sided 5% alpha level. Time-to-event endpoints were analysed in a manner similar to the primary analysis. Best overall response rates and end of treatment response rates in the treatment groups were compared using a chi-square test with continuity correction. In addition, 95% confidence limits for the difference using the Anderson-Hauck approach were calculated. Response rates and 95% confidence limits according to Pearson-Clopper are provided for each treatment group. The proportion of responders and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for each of the response categories by treatment group is presented. The effect of prognostic factors is assessed in an exploratory analysis using logistic regression.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 4 in the ERG report for additional information on clinical effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>The quality assessment checklist suggested by NICE was applied even though the study found was only published in abstract form. Results from the included analysis, conducted by Roche, are summarised in Table 26 in the ERG report.</p>
<p><strong>Model Structure</strong></p>
<p>The submission includes a cohort Markov model, comprised of three states: progression free, progression and death. These are demonstrated in Figure 21 of the ERG report. The progression free health state is divided into two sub-states: on (initial) therapy and off therapy. Individuals in all arms remain on the treatment until they discontinue the therapy (due to adverse events), experience disease progression or die.</p>
<p>Individuals who have completed or discontinued treatment remain in the progression free health state until they progress or die. People in the progressed state remain in the state until they die and cannot return to the progression free health state. These patients are assumed to receive a course of chlorambucil.</p>
<p>The proportion of the cohort in each state is calculated as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The total proportion alive is set to the total proportion alive progression free plus the proportion alive in progress disease. </li>
    <li>The proportion in the progression free health state is set to equal the progression free survival curve. </li>
    <li>The proportion in the progression health state at each cycle is the difference between the proportion alive and the proportion that is progression free. </li>
</ul>
<p>Cycles in the model last one week and a half-cycle correction was applied, except to the drug, administration and pharmacy costs.</p>
<p>Refer to sections 5 and 6 in the ERG report for more information on cost-effectiveness assessment.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technology Appraisal Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The company presented a comparison of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil therapy with chlorambucil monotherapy, chlorambucil plus rituximab therapy, bendamustine monotherapy, and bendamustine plus rituximab therapy.</p>
<p>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC-QLQ) data were collected in CLL11, but were not mapped to the EuroQol (EQ-5D) or used in the model. Instead the company carried out a utility elicitation study to determine the utility values.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>Utility values were determined from a sample of the general population and not from people who had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and were not stratified by age. The Committee believed that the utility values used in the company's model were not reliable.</p>
<p>Several assumptions in the company's model were queried:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The company used the incorrect utility value while on obinutuzumab treatment after the first cycle of obinutuzumab treatment. </li>
    <li>The utility value for progression-free survival off treatment in the company's model was based on the utility elicitation study. </li>
    <li>The company assumed a dose intensity of 100% for bendamustine and rituximab. </li>
    <li>The company used its large network meta-analysis to estimate a hazard ratio of 0.40 for the comparison with bendamustine monotherapy. </li>
    <li>The company used the estimated sample size from an ongoing trial (MaBLe) to calibrate the correlation between the number of people who had a complete response and the progression-free survival hazard ratio for treatment with bendamustine plus rituximab and treatment with rituximab plus chlorambucil. </li>
</ul>
<p>The company submitted a patient access scheme and revised cost-effectiveness analyses that incorporated all of the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) suggested amendments and the Committee's preferred amendments to some of the assumptions made by the company in the base-case analysis. The Committee concluded that the company's revisions to its economic model, including the patient access scheme, the ERG's suggested amendments and updated neutropenia costs, were appropriate and that the company's revised base-case cost-effectiveness estimates were the most appropriate for its decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>EORTC-QLQ data were collected in CLL11 but were not mapped to the EQ-5D or used in the model. Utility values were determined from a sample of the general population and not from people who had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and were not stratified by age. The Committee believed that the utility values used in the company's model were not reliable.</p>
<p>The Committee queried:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The utility value used after the first cycle of obinutuzumab treatment in the company's model, which was based on progression-free survival off treatment. The Committee heard from the company that it had used the incorrect value. The ERG used a value based on progression-free survival on intravenous treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p>The utility value for progression-free survival off treatment in the company's model was based on the utility elicitation study. The ERG highlighted that this utility value was higher than the utility value for the UK general population at a similar age to people with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia whose disease has not progressed and who are off treatment.</p>
<p>No additional benefits with obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil that were not already captured in the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimate in the modelling were identified.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee agreed that the population who cannot have fludarabine could be divided into people who can have bendamustine and those who cannot. It noted that for people who cannot have bendamustine, the most likely incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (including the patient access scheme) for obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil compared with both chlorambucil alone and with rituximab plus chlorambucil were all in the range considered cost effective (&pound;20,000 to &pound;30,000 per QALY gained).</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The company identified the key drivers of the model as the long-term projection of progression-free survival, the post-progression death rate, the results of the large network meta-analysis and the utility values used.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>For people who cannot have bendamustine, the Committee noted that the most likely ICERs (including the patient access scheme) for obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil compared with chlorambucil alone and with rituximab and chlorambucil were within the range considered cost effective (&pound;20,000 to &pound;30,000 per QALY gained).</p>
<p>For people who can have bendamustine, the Committee noted that the most likely ICERs (including the patient access scheme) for obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil compared with both bendamustine alone and with rituximab plus bendamustine were above the top end of the range that would normally be considered cost effective (&pound;20,000 to &pound;30,000 per QALY gained).</p></div>

    <li>This guidance represents the views of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Section 7(6) of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/259/contents/made" title="UK Legislation Web site">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013</a> requires clinical commissioning groups, National Health Services (NHS) England and, with respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the recommendations in this appraisal within 3 months of its date of publication. </li>
    <li>The Welsh Assembly Minister for Health and Social Services has issued directions to the NHS in Wales on implementing NICE technology appraisal guidance. When a NICE technology appraisal recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it within 3 months of the guidance being published. </li>
    <li>When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraph above. This means that, if a patient has chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that obinutuzumab is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. </li>
    <li>The Department of Health and Roche have agreed that obinutuzumab will be available to the NHS with a patient access scheme which makes it available with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the responsibility of the company to communicate details of the discount to the relevant NHS organisations. Any enquiries from NHS organisations about the patient access scheme should be directed to Roche Products, 01707 365736 or <a href="mailto:welwyn.rx_bdop@roche.com">welwyn.rx_bdop@roche.com</a>. </li>
    <li>NICE has developed <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA343/resources" title="NICE Web site">tools</a> to help organisations put this guidance into practice (listed below).
