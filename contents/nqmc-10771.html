<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Epilepsies are amongst the most common significant long-term health conditions of childhood and pose significant challenges for the National Health Service. The Epilepsy12 audit has demonstrated significant improvement in care during its first five years. </p>
<p>Age of greater than 12 is a pragmatic way of defining adolescence or 'childbearing' age.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>In girls of childbearing potential, including young girls who are likely to need treatment into their childbearing years, the risk of the drugs causing harm to an unborn child should be discussed with the child and/or her carer, and an assessment made as to the risks and benefits of treatment with individual drugs (National Institute for Health Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2012).</p>
<p>Adolescent girls taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and their parents should be advised of the risks of fetal malformations and developmental delay (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN], 2005). </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Epilepsy12 Round 2 is the second cycle of this audit which aimed to re-examine the quality of care for children and young people with epilepsies in the United Kingdom (UK).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Audit Key Findings</strong></p>
<p>In the Clinical Audit Domain 12 clinical performance indicators were applied to a cohort of 3,449 children for whom a 'first paediatric assessment' for a 'paroxysmal episode or episodes' was undertaken during the four months between 1 January and 30 April 2013. In Round 1 the cohort was identified similarly but across a six-month period from 1 August 2009 to 31 January 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Audit Performance Indicator Key Findings</strong></p>
<p>Ten of the 12 performance indicators were defined identically to those used in Round 1 and were applied to a similarly defined cohort of children in Round 2. Of the 10 clinical performance indicators where longitudinal comparison was possible across rounds, 9 indicators showed a statistically significant improvement across the UK (tertiary involvement being the exception&ndash;point 3 on the chart). The 12 performance indicators results for both rounds are summarised in the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Recruitment</strong></p>
<p>The audit covered England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. All paediatric services that employ NHS paediatricians that request electroencephalograms (EEGs) and are involved with the care of children and young people with seizures or epilepsy were invited to participate. During Round 1, the UK was split into pragmatic regions and 'audit units'. Each 'audit unit' had defined: Consultant Paediatricians (one of whom acting as the audit unit lead); National Health Service (NHS) Health Boards, Trusts; Hospitals; Community Paediatric services and EEG services. Audit units invited to participate in Round 1 were also invited to participate in Round 2.</p>
<p><strong>Data and Quality Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The data collection system included validation rules to ensure that appropriate and internally consistent data was provided by the participating units. This meant that the overall data quality standard was high. Six records were removed from the dataset as the first paediatric assessment had taken place when the child was less than one month old or an implausible age at first paediatric assessment was recorded. Audit units were able to view provisional data and provide corrected data where appropriate. </p>
<p>The Epilepsy12 indicators are reported with 95% confidence intervals. The Wilson score method has been used to calculate confidence intervals. The confidence intervals can be used to assess whether there has been a statistically significant change in between Round 1 and Round 2 or between countries. If the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap the difference is statistically significant. Individual Audit Units are identified as a positive outlier (statistically significantly higher than the UK value) if the unit's upper 95% confidence interval is below the lower confidence interval for the UK. This is equivalent to being approximately two standard deviations above the UK value. Units are identified as a negative outlier (statistically significantly lower than the UK value) if the unit's lower 95% confidence interval is above the upper confidence interval for the UK. This is equivalent to being approximately two standard deviations below the UK value.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Inclusions<br />
</strong>Female children 12 years and more who were commenced on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) </p>
<p><em>Clinical Cohort Ascertainment</em>: An initial heterogeneous group will be identified from electroencephalogram (EEG) services who will identify the potentially eligible group by identifying all children referred for a first EEG between 1 January and 31 October 2013. The EEG service will forward a list of all cases identified on a monthly basis to the audit unit lead who will filter the cases to form the cohort by application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Refer to the original measure documentation for additional information. </p>
<p><em>Inclusion Criteria</em>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>First EEG between 1 January and 31 October 2013. </li>
    <li>The child has a 'first paediatric assessment' for the 'paroxysmal episode or episodes' between 1 January and 30 April 2013. </li>
    <li>Child is older than 1 month and younger than 16 years at 'first paediatric assessment'. </li>
    <li>The EEG was prompted by the patient having one or more afebrile paroxysmal episodes. </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>AEDs</em>: Regular daily drug treatment for reduction of risk of epileptic seizures in epilepsy. Not including drug treatment given for during a prolonged seizure (e.g., rectal diazepam/paraldehyde, buccal midazolam, intravenous [IV] lorazepam/phenytoin) or clusters of seizures (e.g., intermittent clobazam). Not including drugs where the purpose of treatment is for something other than epilepsy treatment (e.g., carbamazepine [CBZ] for behaviour, topiramate for migraine, etc.) </li>
    <li><em>First Paediatric Assessment</em>: A 'face to face' assessment by a secondary level/tier doctor in a paediatric service occurring in any non-acute or acute setting. Assessment within emergency department (ED) counts if performed by paediatric team rather than an ED team. Some paediatric neurologists see referrals direct from GP or ED and these would count as both a first paediatric assessment and tertiary input. </li>
    <li><em>Paroxysmal Episodes</em>: This is the term chosen in this audit to represent the events causing concern. It includes all epileptic and non-epileptic seizures and also seizures of uncertain origin. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>All 'paroxysmal episodes' in question were diagnosed as 'febrile seizures'. (Children with a history of febrile seizures being assessed for different afebrile 'paroxysmal episodes' may be included.) </li>
    <li>The patient has had a paediatric assessment previously for similar episode or episodes or epilepsy prior to first paediatric assessment. </li>
    <li>All the paroxysmal episodes that the patient had were acute symptomatic seizures or occurred within a week of a traumatic head injury. </li>
    <li>The patient's care was permanently transferred to a secondary paediatric service outside the 'audit unit' boundaries or an adult service during the year after first paediatric assessment. </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Febrile Seizure</em>: An episode diagnosed by the assessing team as a 'febrile seizure' or 'febrile convulsion' or 'febrile fit'. </li>
    <li><em>Acute Symptomatic Seizures</em>: Seizures occurring at the time of a diagnosis of an acute disorder (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, electrolyte disturbance, etc.). </li>
    <li><em>Audit Unit</em>: One or more secondary tier paediatric services grouped together using pragmatic boundaries agreed by the paediatric audit unit link, the project team and the tertiary link. </li>
