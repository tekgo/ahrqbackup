Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of final reports for patients aged 18 years and older who had a previously documented iodinated contrast reaction who undergo any imaging examination using intravenous iodinated contrast that include documentation that the patients were pre-medicated with corticosteroids with or without H1 antihistamines.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Reactions to contrast media are common, occurring in as many as 13% of patients (Bush &amp; Swanson, 1991). Most reactions are mild, with severe reactions occurring in less than 1% of cases (American College of Radiology [ACR] Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2013). Premedication with corticosteroids has been shown to reduce the rate of contrast reactions by as much as 35% among "high risk" patients who have had a previous reaction to contrast media (Lasser et al., 1994).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and other references</strong>:</p>
<p>The primary indication for premedication is pre-treatment of "at-risk" patients who require contrast media. In this context, "at-risk" means at higher risk for an acute allergic-like reaction (ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2013).</p>
<p>Before deciding to premedicate an "at-risk" patient, some consideration should be given to the goals of such premedication. Ideally, one would like to prevent all contrast reactions, including minor, moderate, and severe ones. However, it is most important to target premedication to those who, in the past, have had moderately severe or severe reactions requiring treatment (ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2013).</p>
<p>No premedication strategy should be a substitute for the preadministration preparedness discussed in this manual. Contrast reactions occur despite premedication prophylaxis. The radiologist must be prepared and able to treat these reactions. Most commonly, a repeat reaction will be similar to the patients' initial reaction; however, there is a chance that a recurrent reaction will be more or less severe (ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media, 2013).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
As imaging technology continues to advance, the United States healthcare system has seen an increase in both the type and frequency of imaging studies being performed. The increase in utilization of imaging studies is accompanied by a corresponding increase in cost and exposure to radiation for both patients and healthcare professionals. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the number of radiologic procedures performed in the United States showed a ten-fold increase while the annual per-capita effective dose from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures increased by 600% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, the number of computerized tomographic (CT) examinations tripled, while the number of ultrasounds nearly doubled (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine, and ultrasound) accounted for approximately 35% of all imaging studies (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the proportion of radiation exposure that is attributable to medical sources increased from 17% to 53% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, while CT scans only accounted for approximately 17% of all radiologic procedures performed in the United States, they accounted for over 65% of the total effective radiation dose from radiologic procedures (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, the estimated per-capita effective radiation dose for radiologic procedures in the United States was nearly 20% higher than the average for other well-developed countries (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic imaging was prioritized as a topic area for measure development due to a high level of utilization, rising costs, and the need for measures to help promote appropriate use of imaging and improve outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
In a 2011 survey (O'Malley et al., 2011) of uroradiologists, 86% of respondents reported having a standardized premedication regimen. Additionally, the survey found significant variability in the use of premedication for specific clinical scenarios such as an urgent or emergent situation.</p></div>
