<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Search Strategy</strong></span></p>
<p>Literature searches were used to identify systematic reviews that would serve as the basis of the guideline. Secondly, the results of the searches served as sources of evidence or information on issues related to, but outside the context of, the Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcome (PICO), such as cost, adverse effects, and patient preferences. </p>
<p>Literature searches were conducted in PubMed&reg;/MEDLINE, EMBASE&reg;, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, gray literature, and trial databases to identify systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials of silver diamine fluoride (SDF). Search results were reviewed in duplicate at both the title and abstract and the full-text level when warranted. Disagreements were resolved by consensus; if agreement could not be reached, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) Evidence-Based Dentistry Committee (EBDC) overseeing the workgroup was consulted to settle the question. A detailed description of the search strategies is presented in Appendix I in the original guideline document. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong></span></p>
<p>The criteria used to identify publications for use in the guideline were determined by the clinical PICO question. See Appendix I in the original guideline document for search strategies. Publications which addressed the use of SDF to arrest caries lesions in primary teeth, regardless of language, merited full-text review; in vitro studies and studies of the use of SDF outside of the guideline's stated outcomes were excluded. No new randomized controlled trials were identified that warranted updating the meta-analysis found in the systematic review selected as the basis for this guideline.</p>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Assessment of the Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p>The main strength of this guideline is that it is based on a systematic review of prospective randomized and controlled trials of silver diamine fluoride (SDF). Evidence was assessed via the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, a widely adopted and peer reviewed system of evaluating study quality (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). The guideline recommendation is based on the meta-analysis of four controlled trials (three randomized), extracted in duplicate, from a systematic review of SDF. Randomized (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) offer the highest level of clinical evidence; therefore, a recommendation based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of graded RCTs/CCTs provides more reliable and accurate conclusions that can be applied towards patient care. </p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Workgroup</strong></span></p>
<p>In December 2016, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's (AAPD's) Board of Trustees approved a panel nominated by the Evidence-Based Dentistry Committee (EBDC) to develop a new evidence-based clinical practice guideline on silver diamine fluoride (SDF). The panel consisted of general and pediatric dentists in public and private practice involved in research and education; the stakeholders consisted of representatives from general dentistry, dental hygiene, governmental and non-governmental agencies, and international and specialty dental organizations. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Questions Addressed</strong></span></p>
<p>The panel members used the Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcome (PICO) formulation to develop the clinical questions that will aid practitioners in the use of SDF in primary teeth with caries lesions. <em>Does the application of SDF arrest cavitated caries lesions as effectively as other treatment modalities in primary teeth?</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Formulation of the Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The panel formulated this guideline collectively via surveys, teleconferences, and electronic communications from January 2017&ndash;August 2017. The panel used the evidence-to-decision framework in an iterative manner to formulate the recommendations. Specifically, the main methods used were discussion, debate, and consensus seeking. To reach consensus, the panel voted anonymously on all contentious issues and on the final recommendation. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to determine the strength of the evidence.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Understanding the Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) rates the strength of a recommendation as either strong or conditional (refer to the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). A strong recommendation "is one for which guideline panel is confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects (strong recommendation for an intervention) or that the undesirable effects of an intervention outweigh its desirable effects (strong recommendation against an intervention)." A strong recommendation implies most patients would benefit from the suggested course of action (i.e., either for or against the intervention). A conditional recommendation "is one for which the desirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable effects (conditional recommendation for an intervention) or undesirable effects probably outweigh the desirable effects (conditional recommendation against an intervention), but appreciable uncertainty exists." A conditional recommendation implies that not all patients would benefit from the intervention. The individual patient's circumstances, preferences, and values need to be assessed more than usual. Practitioners need to allocate more time for consultation along with explanation of the potential benefits and harms to the patients and their caregivers when recommendations are rated as conditional. Practitioners' expertise and judgment as well as patients' and their caregivers' needs and preferences establish the suitability of the recommendation to individual patients. The strength of a recommendation presents different implications for patients, clinicians, and policy makers.</p></div>

</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>With caries lesion arrest rates upwards of 70 percent (i.e., higher than other comparable interventions), silver diamine fluoride (SDF) presents as an advantageous modality. Besides its efficacy, SDF is favored by its less invasive (clinically and in terms of behavior guidance requirements) nature and its inexpensiveness.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adverse Reactions</span></strong></p>
<p>No severe pulpal damage or reaction to SDF has been reported. However, SDF should not be placed on exposed pulps. Teeth with deep caries lesions should be closely monitored clinically and radiographically. Serum concentration of fluoride following SDF application per manufacturer recommendations posed little toxicity risk and was below EPA oral reference dose in adults.</p>
<p>The following adverse effects have been noted in the literature: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Metallic/bitter taste. </li>
    <li>Temporary staining to skin which resolves in 2 to 14 days. </li>
    <li>Mucosal irritation/lesions resulting from inadvertent contact with SDF, resolved within 48 hours. </li>

    <li>This guideline is limited by the small number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating silver diamine fluoride (SDF), the heterogeneity of the included trials, and selection bias that may have been introduced by possibly poor sequence generation and selective reporting by one study. Weaknesses of this guideline are inherent to the limitations found in the systematic review upon which this guideline is based. Major limitations of the supporting literature include lack of calibration and/or evidence of agreement for examiners assessing clinical outcomes and unclear definitions or inconsistent criteria for caries lesion activity. Arguably, without a valid and reliable method to determine lesion activity at baseline and follow-up, misclassification bias is possible, especially because clinicians cannot be blinded with regard to SDF application (due to the dark staining). The absence of rigorous caries detection and activity measurement criteria in the reviewed literature can decrease the validity of the reported results. Other reviewers of the systematic review noted similar and additional limitations. </li>
