Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of stress echocardiography, single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI), stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) studies performed at a hospital outpatient facility in the 30 days prior to an ambulatory low-risk, non-cardiac surgery performed anywhere.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Cardiac imaging is among the most common imaging services in the Medicare population. Concomitant with the growth in cardiac imaging, the number of non-cardiac, low-risk surgeries and procedures has progressively increased during the past 20 years (Hernandez, Newby, &amp; O'Connor, 2004). While it is important to perform a cardiac risk assessment prior to surgery to identify high-risk beneficiaries, an extensive cardiac workup is unnecessary among both low-risk beneficiaries and for low-risk surgeries. Perioperative risk is proportional both to the severity of the beneficiaries' heart failure and the surgical risk (Savino &amp; Fleisher, 2006). In general, as evidenced in clinical guidelines and the peer-reviewed literature, preoperative cardiac tests should be performed only if test results are likely to influence beneficiary treatment.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>During the measure development process, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) completed testing of the measure's specifications, including evaluation of the measure's scientific acceptability and feasibility of implementation by a Technical Expert Panel. A dry run, evaluating measure performance at each facility eligible for public reporting, was performed prior to measure implementation; no major stakeholder concerns were raised about the specifications, feasibility, or usability at that time. The measure was first endorsed by the National Quality Forum in 2011, and has maintained endorsement since that time.</p>
<p>CMS continues to monitor stakeholder inquiries for concerns about measure calculation or scientific acceptability; feedback received through this vehicle can feed into the measure update cycle, as is appropriate. In fall 2015, CMS completed a robust evaluation of the measure's importance, scientific acceptability (including reliability and validity), feasibility, and usability and use. </p></div>

Number of stress echocardiography, single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI), stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) studies performed at the hospital outpatient department</p>
<p><em>Initial Patient Population</em>: This measure applies only to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in original, fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare who were treated as outpatients in hospital facilities reimbursed through the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). These measures do not include Medicare managed care beneficiaries, non-Medicare patients, or beneficiaries who were admitted to the hospital as inpatients. </p>
<p>Beneficiaries included in the measure's initial patient population had documentation of stress echocardiography, SPECT MPI, stress MRI, or CCTA studies performed at the hospital outpatient department within a one-year window of claims data. Beneficiaries can be included in the measure's initial patient population multiple times; each stress echocardiography, SPECT MPI, stress MRI, and CCTA studies performed at a facility measured by OPPS is counted once in the measure's denominator.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Beneficiaries who have a clinical diagnosis of one or more conditions for which imaging is considered appropriate are excluded from the measure.</p>
<p>For this measure, beneficiaries with a history of at least three diagnosis codes from the following categories are excluded from the measure's initial patient population; these conditions include diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, stroke/transient ischemic attack, prior heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. For these conditions, clinical evidence exists (within a practice guideline or the peer-reviewed literature) that indicates these beneficiaries may be at high risk of cardiac involvement during low-risk surgery; consequently, performing a stress echocardiography, SPECT MPI, stress MRI, or CCTA study prior to an ambulatory non-cardiac, low-risk surgery may be appropriate care. Thus, any beneficiary with a history of three or more of these conditions is excluded from the measure.</p>
<p>Refer to the original measure documentation for additional information on the measure's excluded conditions, such as look-back periods and codes used to define each condition.</p>
