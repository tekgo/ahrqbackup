<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gene: <em>CYP2D6</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Genetic Test Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>Most clinical laboratories report cytochrome P450 2D6 (<em>CYP2D6</em>) genotype using the star (*) allele nomenclature and may provide interpretation of the patient's predicted metabolizer phenotype. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other sequence variations, including insertions and deletions, are determined by genetic laboratory tests. The reference SNP number (rs number) for a SNP defines the specific genomic nucleotide alteration. Each star (*) allele (or haplotype) is defined by the presence of a specific combination of SNPs and/or other sequence alterations within the <em>CYP2D6</em> gene locus. The key alleles with their allele-defining SNPs and respective impacts on CYP2D6 enzyme function are provided in Supplementary Table S2 online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Genetic results are reported as a diplotype, which includes one maternal and one paternal allele (e.g., <em>CYP2D6*1/*4</em>). In some cases, patients have more than two copies of the <em>CYP2D6</em> gene; up to 13 gene copies have been described. Those alleles are denoted by an "<em>xN</em>" following the allele designation (e.g., <em>CYP2D6*2x2</em> duplication; see Supplementary Data online for details [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Additional details about allele nomenclature and definitions can be found at <a href="http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2d6.htm" title="The Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database">http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2d6.htm</a>, and information regarding the effects of allelic variation on CYP2D6 substrates can be found at the CPIC Web site (<a href="https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/download/file/attachment/CYP2D6_allele_definition_table.xlsx" title="CPIC Web site">https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/download/file/attachment/CYP2D6_allele_definition_table.xlsx</a>). <em>CYP2D6</em> allele frequencies differ substantially among racial and ethnic groups. Supplementary Table S1 online summarizes the most important frequencies for various ethnic groups (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The combination of alleles is used to determine a patient's diplotype. <em>CYP2D6</em> alleles are characterized as wild-type (normal function), reduced-function, or nonfunctional alleles based on the expected activity of the enzyme that they encode. Each allele is assigned an activity value (i.e., 0 for nonfunctional, 0.5 for reduced-function, or 1.0 for fully functional forms). Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) describe the activity score values assigned to selected alleles and example diplotypes, respectively. If multiple copies of the <em>CYP2D6</em> gene are detected, the activity score is multiplied by the number of copies of each allele present. The total CYP2D6 activity score is the sum of the values assigned to each allele, which typically ranges from 0 to 3.0 but may exceed 3.0 in rare cases.</p>
<p>The CYP2D6 activity score relates to the phenotype classification system as follows (Table 1 below): patients with an activity score of 0 are poor metabolizers, those with a score of 0.5 are considered intermediate metabolizers, and those with a score of 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 represent a range of extensive metabolizers. Patients with a score &gt;2.0 are classified as ultrarapid metabolizers. The extensive metabolizer phenotype represents normal (wild-type) enzyme activity. The incidence of poor and ultrarapid metabolizers varies greatly among populations (0&ndash;10% and 0&ndash;29%, respectively). Predicted phenotypes of common diplotypes are summarized in Supplementary Table S5 online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Subjects with genotypes giving rise to an activity score of 1.0, which can be due to a diplotype containing one functional and one nonfunctional allele or containing two reduced-function alleles, are classified by some investigators as intermediate metabolizers. Regardless of the term used to describe such individuals (extensive or intermediate metabolizer), their CYP2D6 activity is lower as compared with subjects having two fully functional alleles (with an activity score of 2.0) and higher as compared with subjects having one reduced and one nonfunctional allele (with an activity score of 0.5). Because there is no gold standard for phenotype classification, genotypes that result in CYP2D6 activity scores of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 are grouped together as extensive metabolizers in this guideline based on data specific for codeine metabolism (Supplementary Table S6 online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p>Reference laboratories providing clinical <em>CYP2D6</em> genotyping may use varying methods to assign phenotypes. Therefore, it is advisable to note a patient's <em>CYP2D6</em> diplotype and to calculate an activity score before making therapeutic decisions about codeine therapy.</p>

<p class="Note"><sup>a</sup>The frequency estimates are based on data from Caucasians and may differ substantially for other ethnicities. See Supplementary Data online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for estimates of phenotype frequencies among different ethnic/geographic groups.</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>b</sup>Note that some investigators define patients with an activity score of 0.5 and 1.0 as intermediate metabolizers and those with an activity score of 1.5 and 2.0 as extensive metabolizers. Classifying patients with an activity score of 1.0 as extensive metabolizers in this guideline is based on data specific for formation of morphine from codeine in these patients.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drug: Codeine</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Table 2 below summarizes the therapeutic recommendations for codeine based on <em>CYP2D6</em> phenotype. A standard starting dose of codeine, as recommended in the product label, is warranted in patients with an extensive metabolizer phenotype (i.e., a CYP2D6 activity score of 1.0&ndash;2.0). Likewise, a standard starting dose of codeine is warranted in patients with an intermediate metabolizer phenotype (i.e., activity score of 0.5); these patients should be monitored closely for less-than-optimal response and should be offered an alternative analgesic if warranted. If the CYP2D6 substrate tramadol is selected as alternative therapy in intermediate metabolizers, therapy should be monitored closely due to the possibility of poor response.</p>
<p>If clinical genotyping identifies a patient as a <em>CYP2D6</em> poor metabolizer (i.e., activity score of 0), current evidence supports the avoidance of codeine and the use of an alternative analgesic due to the possibility of lack of effect. Use of an analgesic other than the CYP2D6 substrates tramadol, hydrocodone, or oxycodone in poor metabolizers may be preferable. There is insufficient evidence in the literature to recommend a higher dose of codeine in poor metabolizers, especially considering the evidence that select adverse effects do not differ between poor and extensive metabolizers. In a patient identified as a <em>CYP2D6</em> ultrarapid metabolizer (i.e., activity score of &gt;2.0), the choice of another analgesic should be made to avoid the risk of severe toxicity with a "normal" dose of codeine.</p>
<p>To avoid treatment complications, opioids that are not metabolized by <em>CYP2D6</em>, including morphine, oxymorphone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, methadone, and hydromorphone, along with nonopioid analgesics, may be considered as alternatives for use in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers based on the type, severity, and chronicity of the pain being treated.</p>

    <li>Cytochrome P450 2D6 (<em>CYP2D6</em>) genotyping is reliable when performed in qualified laboratories. However, as with any laboratory test, a possible risk to the patient is an error in genotyping that could have long-term adverse health implications for the patient. </li>
    <li>Breastfeeding women with an ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype may achieve high serum concentrations of morphine on standard codeine therapy. This may lead to high levels of morphine in breast milk and dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants. Caution should be used when prescribing codeine to a breastfeeding woman with an ultrarapid metabolizer status. </li>
    <li>In February 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced its strongest and new black box warning against codeine use to manage postoperative pain in children following tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. This warning was in response to further FDA review of the codeine-related deaths and serious adverse drug reactions. The FDA warning is applicable to all children undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy irrespective of their obstructive sleep apnea status or <em>CYP2D6</em> genotype/phenotype. </li>
    <li>Common adverse reactions to codeine include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, shortness of breath, constipation, and itching. Serious adverse reactions include respiratory depression and, rarely, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. </li>
    <li>Pharmacokinetic studies show increased conversion of codeine to morphine in <em>CYP2D6</em> ultrarapid vs. extensive metabolizers, which can result in toxic systemic concentrations of morphine even at low codeine doses. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<p>Rare cytochrome P450 2D6 (<em>CYP2D6</em>) variants may not be included in the genotype test used, and patients with rare variants may be assigned a "wild-type" (<em>CYP2D6*1</em>) genotype by default. Thus, an assigned "wild-type" allele may, in rare cases, harbor a loss-of-function variant resulting in inadequate pain response to codeine. Like all diagnostic tests, that for <em>CYP2D6</em> genotype is one of multiple pieces of information that clinicians should consider in guiding their therapeutic choice for each patient. Furthermore, there are several other factors that cause potential uncertainty in the genotyping results and phenotype predictions. These are discussed in detail in the Supplementary Data online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision making and to identify questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for all individual variations among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the health-care provider to determine the best course of treatment for a patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made solely by the clinician and the patient.
