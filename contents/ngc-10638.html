Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Identification and Appraisal of Existing Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>A guideline was sought which could be adapted to the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario (POGO) context for the management of anticipatory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Guideline Search Strategy</strong>: During August and September 2012, the POGO CINV Guideline Development Group conducted a search of bibliographic databases and the grey literature to identify existing practice guidelines for the management of anticipatory CINV in children with cancer. Computerized searches were performed with the assistance of a library scientist using the OVID search platform for the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The search engine Google was utilized for identification of grey literature including local, provincial, national and international databases. In addition the panel members reviewed their files for potentially relevant guidelines. The search strategies are provided in Appendix A in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li><strong>Guideline Selection Criteria and Appraisal</strong>: Guidelines were selected for inclusion that: (i) provided recommendations for the management of anticipatory, breakthrough and/or delayed CINV; (ii) were published in 2008 or more recently; and (iii) were published in English. Financial limitations precluded translation of guidelines published in languages other than English. Guidelines were excluded if it was not clear that the guideline statements or recommendations were based on a review of evidence from the literature and/or were not based on a source that used evidence to support the guideline development process. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Systematic Reviews of Primary Studies</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Prevention and Treatment of Anticipatory CINV</strong>: As none of the guidelines identified specifically addressed the management of anticipatory CINV in children with cancer and there was variability between the adult-focused guidelines on inclusion of studies addressing anticipatory CINV, a systematic review of primary studies evaluating anticipatory CINV in adults and/or children was conducted.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li><em>Search Strategy</em>: The following databases were searched and included articles indexed as of November 28, 2012: OvidSP - MEDLINE, EMBASE &amp; EMBASE Classic, EBM Reviews &ndash; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCTR), HaPI (Health and Psychosocial Instruments), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine); EBSCOHost CINAHL; ProQuest Dissertation Abstracts. The search strategies are provided in Appendix C in the original guideline document. </li>
        <li><em>Selection Criteria and Appraisal</em>: Citations were independently screened for relevancy by two reviewers. All citations identified as potentially relevant by either reviewer were included for full-text screening. Two reviewers independently evaluated the full-text papers to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. Primary studies were included if they: (i) were published in a journal in full text (i.e., abstracts, letters, book chapters and dissertations were excluded); (ii) were published in English; (iii) evaluated an intervention for the prevention or treatment of anticipatory CINV; (iv) reported the proportion of patients experiencing complete control of anticipatory CINV and (v) the number of participants was &gt;10 per study arm for comparative studies and &gt;2 overall for non-comparative studies. Financial limitations precluded translation of guidelines published in languages other than English. The minimum number of required subjects in included pediatric studies was lower than that for adult studies in recognition of the smaller evidence base in pediatrics and the likelihood that pediatric studies would involve fewer patients than adult studies. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prevalence of Anticipatory CINV Pre-post Use of 5-HT3 Antagonists</strong>: As several of the prominent adult-focused antiemetic guidelines recommend optimal control of acute CINV to prevent anticipatory CINV, a review of primary studies which evaluated the prevalence of anticipatory CINV in adult and pediatric patients was performed.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li><em>Search Strategy</em>: The same set of citations identified by the search strategy for the prevention and treatment of anticipatory CINV systematic review was used, as a very broad search strategy was employed to identify anticipatory CINV studies. The search strategies are provided in Appendix C in the original guideline document. </li>
        <li><em>Selection Criteria and Appraisal</em>: Citations were independently screened for relevancy by two reviewers. All citations identified as potentially relevant by either reviewer were included for full-text screening.

Studies were included if they were: (i) primary studies that were published in a journal in full text (i.e., abstracts, letters, book chapters and dissertations were excluded); (ii) published in English; (iii) determined the proportion of patients experiencing anticipatory CINV; (iv) the sample size per study arm was &ge;10 subjects for pediatric studies and &ge;20 subjects for adult only or mixed adult/pediatric studies; and (v) the study inclusion criteria did not specifically select for patients with post-chemotherapy CINV. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Health Questions</strong></p>
<p>The guideline sought to answer the following health questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What approaches are recommended to prevent the development of anticipatory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in children? </li>
    <li>What interventions are recommended to control anticipatory CINV in children who develop it? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Panel</strong></p>
<p>The Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario (POGO) identified CINV as a key supportive care initiative in 2008 and the POGO CINV Guideline Development Group was formed in December 2008. Members were selected with a view to obtain inter-disciplinary representation from several POGO institutions as well as content expertise. Experts who had published in the area of CINV in children or who had a current research interest in CINV or supportive care in cancer were invited to join the guideline development group. After the completion of the first two POGO guidelines in the CINV series, panel members were asked to confirm their willingness to continue as members of the panel tasked with development of the third guideline in this series. Two members resigned and two new members were recruited.</p>
<p><strong>Decision-making Process for Formulation of the Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Decisions were taken through panel discussions and any differences in opinion were resolved by consensus. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system developed by Guyatt et al. by one author and confirmed through discussion by the remaining panel members. If consensus was unable to be reached on any matter, a decision was made by the majority of panel members by a vote.</p></div>

<p><strong>Who Was Asked to Review the Guideline?</strong></p>
<p><em>Content Expert Review</em></p>
<p>Physicians, nurses and pharmacists with an active clinical and/or research interest in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were asked to review the draft guideline.</p>
<p><em>External Stakeholder Review</em></p>
<p>Health care providers working at the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario (POGO) tertiary centres and their satellites and members of the POGO Supportive Care Steering Committee were asked to review the draft guideline and complete an online survey. Stakeholders from all 5 tertiary centres and 6 of the 7 satellite centres provided feedback. A total of 25 stakeholders provided survey responses.</p>
<p><strong>What Process Was Followed?</strong></p>
<p>The willingness of potential content expert reviewers to review the guideline was determined by contacting them by telephone or e-mail. Once agreement was obtained, the draft guideline was sent electronically along with instructions for the reviewer to complete a survey (see Appendix H in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Following the content expert review, the draft guideline was sent electronically to health care providers who practice in POGO satellites and tertiary centres together with a request to review the document using a survey (see Appendix I in the original guideline document). Reviewers returned the completed the online survey.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Feedback</strong></p>
<p>The survey results were discussed in detail by the POGO CINV Guideline Development Panel and a decision on each point was taken by consensus. When the decision of the panel was not unanimous, a revision was made if it was supported by at least 60% of the guideline development panel members. The comments of the expert reviewers led to revisions to the guideline as outlined in Table 3 in the original guideline document and a summary of the expert reviewers' responses to the survey questions is provided in Table 4 in the original guideline document.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Implementation Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Evidence-based guidelines should be used to select anti-emetic interventions to prevent acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) for the initial chemotherapy. The child's response, as well as evidence-based recommendations, should be used to select antiemetic interventions to prevent acute and delayed CINV for subsequent chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Institutions should evaluate evidence-based guidelines for endorsement or adaptation and should consider developing antiemetic selection order sets or the incorporation of optimal antiemetic prophylaxis into cancer therapy order sets to facilitate their clinical use.</p>
<p>Health care providers should carefully and frequently evaluate CINV severity across all phases (anticipatory, acute and delayed) in children receiving chemotherapy. Particular attention should be paid to determining the incidence of CINV that may occur when the child is not in the inpatient or clinic setting and its severity. These assessments are needed to guide the need for treatment of anticipatory CINV, when present, and the selection of antiemetic prophylaxis for subsequent chemotherapy treatments. Attentive response to the child's overall CINV experience on the part of health care providers will likely minimize the development of anticipatory CINV.</p>
<p>Members of the health care team who have expertise in the provision of the recommended non-pharmacological interventions (hypnosis, systematic desensitization) should be identified and engaged in the care of children with anticipatory CINV.</p>
<p><strong>Tools for Application</strong></p>
<p>Meticulous attention to the overall CINV experience (anticipatory, acute and delayed phase) of children receiving chemotherapy is required. Validated screening and assessment tools must be developed to facilitate timely and efficient identification of children who do not experience complete CINV control despite receiving guideline-informed antiemetic prophylaxis. CINV diaries (paper or electronic) should be considered to record and track the experience of patients.</p>
<p><strong>Organizational Barriers and Cost Implications</strong></p>
<p>Routine systematic screening of all patients about to receive chemotherapy regarding their experience of anticipatory CINV is critical to the identification of patients who warrant intervention. Each organization should ensure that clinicians accept this as a standard of care and that they have the resources to perform this screening and provide appropriate interventions.</p>
<p>The availability of the resources required to implement the recommendations may be limited at many institutions. Since appropriately trained staff is the primary resource required for the incorporation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control anticipatory CINV, it is suggested that each institution review the number of available child life specialists, psychologists and nurses with the relevant expertise to deliver these therapies.</p>
<p>Costs related to antiemetic agents, especially those used for acute and delayed phase CINV control, may increase when evidence-based guideline recommendations are followed. These increased costs may be counter-balanced by decreased costs due to improved CINV control.</p>
<p><strong>Key Review Criteria for Monitoring and/or Audit Purposes</strong></p>
<p>Routine monitoring and tracking of patients' level of overall CINV control (anticipatory, acute and delayed phase) would not only provide a means to respond to the needs of individual patients but would also provide very much needed information regarding the emetogenicity of chemotherapy regimens in children.</p>
<p>Periodic audits of adherence of antiemetic prescribing to the guideline should be performed at individual institutions. Ideally, each prescriber should receive feed-back regarding the extent of their adherence to the guideline and the rate of complete anticipatory, acute and delayed CINV control seen in their patients.</p></div>
