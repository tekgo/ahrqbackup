<p>The "Family and Visitors" section is one of ten sections that comprise the <a href="/browse/DisplayOrganization.aspx?org_id=16&doc=8415#data" title="Inpatient Pediatric Survey Measures">Inpatient Pediatric Survey</a>.

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ol>
<li>Patient satisfaction is both an indicator of quality of care, and a component of quality care.

<p>In 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) advocated a patient-centered model of care (Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century). In part, this is a reflection of the growing understanding that</p>

<blockquote>
"...patients constantly judge the motives and competence of caregivers through their interaction with them. This judgment is a very personal one, based on perceptions of care being responsive to patients' "individual needs," rather than to any universal code of standards (McGlynn, 1997). When these individual needs are perceived as being met, better care results. Lohr (1997) notes: "Inferior care results when health professionals lack full mastery of their clinical areas or cannot communicate effectively and compassionately." In short, when patients perceive motives, communication, empathy, and clinical judgment positively, they will respond more positively to care...Sobel (1995) claims that improved communication and interaction between caregiver and patient improves actual outcome. Donabedian (1988) notes that "...the interpersonal process is the vehicle by which technical care is implemented and on which its success depends" (from Press [2002] <u>Patient Satisfaction: Defining, Measuring, and Improving the Experience of Care</u>, Health Administration Press).
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that patients quite actively evaluate what is happening to them during the experience of care. The degree to which the patient judges the care experience as satisfactory "...is not only an indicator of the quality of care, but a component of quality care, as well" (Press, 2002).</p>

<p>Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following clinical outcomes: Clinical Quality (e.g., Hemoglobin A1c levels, cholesterol levels, lower bed disability days); Chronic Disease Control; Compliance; Drug Complications; Quality of Life; Emotional Health Status; Mental Health; Physical Functioning; Physical Health Status; Post-Surgery Complications; Post-Surgery Recovery Times; Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rates; Unexpected Mortality; and Work Effectiveness (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004).</p><br />
</li>

<li>In addition to its connection to quality of care and clinical outcomes, Patient Satisfaction has been linked to the following: 

<ul type="disc">
<li>Topline (Revenue): Loyalty; Volume; Physician Satisfaction; Patient's Trust in Provider; Retention; Employee Satisfaction</li>
<li>Bottomline (Expenses): Reduction in Expenses; Reduction in Length of Stay; Reduction in Complaints; Reduction in Malpractice Claims; Direct Measures of Financial Performance (e.g., bond rating, core margin, earnings per adjusted admission, market share, net margin, profit margin) (Clark, Drain, Malone, 2004)</li></ul>
</li></ol>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Psychometric testing of the survey, which was released in 1998, revealed the instrument to be valid and reliable, and to be a significant predictor or theoretically important outcomes such as the respondent's stated likelihood of recommending the hospital to others. Results of factor analysis of the instrument indicate a high degree of construct validity. Each item loaded most highly with its theoretically expected factor, and the factors identified mirror the subscales of the survey. In addition, Cronbach alpha (a measure of internal consistency or reliability) for the entire measure was .98 (with individual subscale alphas ranging from .65 to .95), confirming the instrument's high internal consistency and reliability.  Moreover, multiple regression analyses showed that the survey items accounted for 78% of the variance in the families' stated likelihood to recommend the hospital to others (<em>F</em><sub>44,342</sub> = 30.95, <em>P</em> less than .01; Adjusted <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.78).</p>
