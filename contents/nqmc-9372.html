Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients undergoing a total knee replacement who had a physical examination completed within one year prior to the procedure that included all of the following: gait, knee range of motion, presence or absence of deformity of the knee, stability of the knee, neurologic status (sensory and motor function), vascular status (peripheral pulses), skin, height, and weight.</p>
<p>The American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) measures <em>Assessment of Patient History</em>, <em>Physical Examination</em>, and <em>Radiographic Evidence of Arthritis</em> are a composite measure and must be used together. See the following related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summaries:</p>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A complete examination of the knee is necessary to plan for the surgical procedure. In addition, the patient's preoperative evaluation is important to determine the severity of the patient's knee arthritis and baseline functionality.</p>
<p>A study conducted by SooHoo and colleagues found that all components of the physical examination were documented only 5 percent of the time for the patients undergoing total knee replacement at the 3 hospitals (SooHoo et al., 2011).</p>
<p class="Note">The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines: </p>
<p class="Note">The initial contact (for patients presenting with acute knee pain) may not require obtaining radiographs but should rely on a comprehensive history and physical exam.</p>
<p class="Note">Significant physical examination:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Visual inspection for abnormalities </li>
    <li>Presence and location of warmth </li>
    <li>Tenderness (location) </li>
    <li>Presence and location of swelling </li>
    <li>Range of motion (active and passive) </li>
    <li>Meniscal compression </li>
    <li>Varus/valgus instability (0&deg; and 30&deg; of flexion) </li>
    <li>Anterior drawer with + or &ndash; Lachman </li>
    <li>Foot pulse </li>
    <li>Presence and location of erythema </li>
    <li>Hip pain or abnormalities present </li>
    <li>Patella apprehension </li>
    <li>Crepitance (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons [AAOS], 2003) </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">On physical examination, patients with osteoarthritis (OA) often have tenderness on palpation, bony enlargement, crepitus on motion, and/or limitation of joint motion (American College of Rheumatology, 2000).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>High Impact Topic Area</em><br />
During 1991 to 2010, the rate of primary total knee replacement procedures among the Medicare population increased over 161 percent from 93,230 procedures in 1991 to 243,802 procedures in 2010. The rate of revision procedures increased over 105 percent from 9,650 to 19,871 procedures. The majority of the primary total knee replacements were performed on women (approximately 65 percent) (Cram et al., 2012).</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the overall total knee replacement rate increased 58% (from 5.5 to 8.7 per 1,000 population) between 2000 and 2006. Similar increases were observed by sex, age group, and black or white race. Total knee replacement rates were 37 percent lower among blacks than whites (3.6 versus 5.7 per 1,000 population) in 2000, and 39% lower in 2006 (5.6 versus 9.2). In both years, the black/white disparity was lower among women (23% and 28%) than among men (63% and 60%). In 2006, blacks had a lower total knee replacement rate than whites in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (CDC, 2009).</p>
<p>In 2004 there were over 450,000 total knee replacements performed in the United States (American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons [AAOS], 2008).</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2009, over 22 percent of adults reported they had been diagnosed with arthritis (CDC, 2010). As the population ages, there will be an increased growth in the number of procedures. It is estimated that the number of total knee replacements performed per year could be over 3 million by the year 2030 (Kurtz et al., 2007).</p>
<p><em>Costs</em><br />
Medicare paid approximately $3.2 billion in 2000 for hip and knee joint replacements (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2003).</p>
<p>The overall inpatient costs for replacement of the knee during 2007 was over $9.2 billion with hospital stays of more than 605,000 (Stranges, Russo, &amp; Friedman, 2009).</p></div>
