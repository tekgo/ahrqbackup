Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the number of patients diagnosed with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) that are discharged to home, home care, court/law enforcement or home on hospice care on warfarin with written discharge instructions that address <strong>all</strong> four criteria: compliance issues, dietary advice, follow-up monitoring, and information about the potential for adverse drug reactions/interactions.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In anticoagulation therapy programs, patient education is a vital component to achieve successful outcomes, and reducing hospital readmission rate. Patients benefit from education about the potential consequences of both their disease and its treatment (Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [ICSI], 2006). Warfarin is commonly involved in adverse drug events (Ansell et al., 2008). Adverse drug events can include subtherapeutic clot formation and supertherapeutic hemorrhage. Anticoagulation therapy poses risks to patients due to complex dosing, requisite follow-up monitoring and inconsistent patient compliance. The use of standardized practices for anticoagulation therapy that includes patient/caregiver involvement may reduce the risk of adverse drug events (van Walraven et al., 2006). </p>
<p>The Joint Commission (TJC) National Patient Safety Goal "Reduce the likelihood of patient harm associated with the use of anticoagulant therapy" (2015) states that the organization provides education regarding anticoagulation therapy to patients/family that includes the importance of follow-up monitoring, compliance issues, dietary restrictions, and potential for adverse drug reactions and interactions. </p></div>
