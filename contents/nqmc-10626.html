Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the rate of discharges for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) per 1,000 members and the risk-adjusted ratio of observed to expected discharges for ACSC by chronic and acute conditions, for members 67 years of age and older.</p>
<p>This measure summary represents the Total ACSC category, the sum of the Chronic ACSC and Acute ACSC categories. Refer to the "Basis for Disaggregation" field for details. </p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Ambulatory care sensitive conditions are acute and chronic health conditions that can be managed or treated in the outpatient setting. Appropriate access to care, high-quality care coordination, a focus on chronic disease self-management and connection to community resources can reduce the probability that individuals with these chronic and acute conditions will develop complications or exacerbations that result in hospitalization. </p>
<p>Hospital and inpatient care is the largest component of total health care costs for older adults (24 percent of Medicare spending, approximately $129 billion dollars in 2013) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2015). Hospitalization also poses several risks for older adults, who frequently develop serious conditions as a result of hospitalization such as delirium, infection and decline in functional ability (Gillick, Serrell, &amp; Gillick, 1982; Covinsky, Pierluissi, &amp; Johnston, 2011).</p>
<p>Reducing the rate of hospitalization for potentially preventable complications of acute and chronic conditions for older adults will improve patient health, reduce costs and improve quality of life. It is important to note that some complications or exacerbations are unavoidable and therefore the appropriate rate of hospitalization is not "zero;" however, this measure will provide important information to health plans, providers and consumers and other stakeholders about how well a system of care helps older adults with chronic and acute conditions prevent hospitalization.</p></div>
