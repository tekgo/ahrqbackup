Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Levels of evidence (<strong>I&ndash;V</strong>) and grades of recommendation (<strong>A&ndash;F</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk Factors</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Acute Lateral Ankle Sprain</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should recognize the increased risk of acute lateral ankle sprain in individuals who (1) have a history of a previous ankle sprain, (2) do not use an external support, (3) do not properly warm up with static stretching and dynamic movement before activity, (4) do not have normal ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, and (5) do not participate in a balance/proprioceptive prevention program when there is a history of a previous injury. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ankle Instability</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should recognize the increased risk for developing ankle instability in patients who (1) have an increased talar curvature, (2) are not using an external support, or (3) did not perform balance or proprioception exercises following an acute lateral ankle sprain. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation C)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis/Classification</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Acute Lateral Ankle Sprain</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use the clinical findings of level of function, ligamentous laxity, hemorrhaging, point tenderness, total ankle motion, swelling, and pain to classify a patient with acute ankle ligament sprain into the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) category of sprain and strain of ankle (S93.4), and the associated International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) impairment-based category of ankle stability (b7150 stability of a single joint) and movement coordination impairments (b7601 control of complex voluntary movements). <strong>(Grade of Recommendation B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ankle Instability</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may incorporate a discriminative instrument, such as the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool, to assist in identifying the presence and severity of ankle instability associated with the ICD category of instability secondary to old ligament injury, ankle and foot (M24.27), and the associated ICF impairment-based category of ankle stability (b7150 stability of a single joint) and movement coordination impairments (b7601 control of complex voluntary movements). <strong>(Grade of Recommendation B)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Differential Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Acute Lateral Ankle Sprain</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use diagnostic classifications other than an acute lateral ankle sprain when the patient's reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section of this guideline. Particularly, the Ottawa and Bernese ankle rules should be used to determine whether a radiograph is required to rule out a fracture of the ankle and/or foot. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ankle Instability</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use diagnostic classifications other than ankle instability when the patient's reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section of this guideline. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation F)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examination</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should incorporate validated functional outcome measures, such as the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), as part of a standard clinical examination. These should be utilized before and after interventions intended to alleviate the impairments of body function and structure, activity limitations, and participation restrictions associated with ankle sprain and instability. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Activity Limitation and Participation Restriction Measures</strong></p>
<p>When evaluating a patient in the postacute period following a recent or recurring lateral ankle sprain, assessment of activity limitation, participation restriction, and symptom reproduction should include objective and reproducible measures, such as single-limb hop tests that assess performance with lateral movements, diagonal movements, and directional changes. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Physical Impairment Measures</strong></p>
<p>When evaluating a patient with an acute or subacute lateral ankle sprain over an episode of care, assessment of impairment of body function should include objective and reproducible measures of ankle swelling, ankle range of motion, talar translation and inversion, and single-leg balance. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interventions&mdash;Acute/Protected Motion Phase</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Early Weight Bearing With Support</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should advise patients with acute lateral ankle sprains to use external supports and to progressively bear weight on the affected limb. The type of external support and gait assistive device recommended should be based on the severity of the injury, phase of tissue healing, level of protection indicated, extent of pain, and patient preference. In more severe injuries, immobilization ranging from semi-rigid bracing to below-knee casting may be indicated. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Manual Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use manual therapy procedures, such as lymphatic drainage, active and passive soft tissue and joint mobilization, and anterior-to-posterior talar mobilization procedures, within pain-free movement, to reduce swelling, improve pain-free ankle and foot mobility and normalize gait parameters in individuals with an acute lateral ankle sprain. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation B)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Physical Agents</strong></p>
<p><em>Cryotherapy</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should use repeated intermittent applications of ice to reduce pain, decrease the need for pain medication, and improve weight bearing following an acute ankle sprain. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><em>Diathermy</em></p>
<p>Clinicians can utilize pulsating shortwave diathermy for reducing edema and gait deviations associated with acute ankle sprains. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation C)</strong></p>
<p><em>Electrotherapy</em></p>
<p>There is moderate evidence both for and against the use of electrotherapy for the management of acute ankle sprains. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation D)</strong></p>
<p><em>Low-level laser therapy</em></p>
<p>There is moderate evidence both for and against the use of low-level laser therapy for the management of acute ankle sprains. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation D)</strong></p>
<p><em>Ultrasound</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should not use ultrasound for the management of acute ankle sprains. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Exercises</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should implement rehabilitation programs that include therapeutic exercises for patients with severe lateral ankle sprains. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interventions&mdash;Progressive Loading/Sensorimotor Training Phase</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Manual Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should include manual therapy procedures, such as graded joint mobilizations, manipulations, and non&ndash;weight-bearing and weight-bearing mobilization with movement, to improve ankle dorsiflexion, proprioception, and weight-bearing tolerance in patients recovering from a lateral ankle sprain. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Exercise and Activities</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may include therapeutic exercises and activities, such as weight-bearing functional exercises and single-limb balance activities using unstable surfaces, to improve mobility, strength, coordination, and postural control in the postacute period of rehabilitation for ankle sprains. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation C)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sport-Related Activity Training</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians can implement balance and sport-related activity training to reduce the risk for recurring ankle sprains in athletes. <strong>(Grade of Recommendation C)</strong></p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>It was acknowledged by the Orthopaedic Section, American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) content experts that only performing a systematic search and review of the evidence related to diagnostic categories based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) terminology would not be sufficient for these International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF)-based clinical practice guidelines, as most of the evidence associated with changes in levels of impairment or function in homogeneous populations is not readily searchable using the ICD terminology.</p>
<p>Thus, the authors of this guideline independently performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1967 through April 2012) for any relevant articles related to classification, examination, and intervention strategies for ankle sprains. Additionally, when relevant articles were identified, their reference lists were hand searched in an attempt to identify other relevant articles.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>These guidelines are not intended to be construed as or to serve as a standard of medical care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made in light of the clinical data presented by the patient; the diagnostic and treatment options available; and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences. However, it is suggested that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in the patient's medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.</p></div>
