<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Restraints can pose serious risks for residents. They are used to control behavior for people with disruptive, aggressive, or dangerous behavior, including those with cognitive impairment (Sullivan-Marx et al., 1999; Capezuti et al., 1996; Castle &amp; Mor, 1998). Second quarter 2008 statewide averages for the current Chronic Care Restraint Quality Measure (QM) range from 0.0% in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to 8.9% in California, with a 4.3% national average (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2008).</p>
<p>The use of physical restraints is associated with several adverse outcomes for the physical and mental health of the restrained (Hofmann &amp; Hahn, 2014; Castle &amp; Engberg, 2009; Engberg, Castle, &amp; McCaffrey, 2008; Sullivan-Marx, 2001; Capezuti et al., 2006; Castle &amp; Mor, 1998) and may lead to decreased functional ability (Hofmann &amp; Hahn, 2014), poorer oral hygiene (Willumsen et al., 2012), delirium (Boorsma et al., 2012; Voyer et al., 2011) and, in residents with dementia, increased pain (Lin et al., 2011). The benefits of refraining from the use of physical restraints by employing clinically sound interventions to address the causes of falls, wandering, and other behaviors have been well-documented in the long-term care literature; they include improved quality of life, greater autonomy, use of fewer antipsychotic medications, less skin breakdown, and fewer serious injuries resulting from falls (CMS, 2013; Engberg, Castle, &amp; McCaffrey, 2008; Sullivan-Marx, 2001; Capezuti et al., 1996; CMS, 2002). Through multiple clinical trials, case studies, and facility-level intervention studies, research has also shown that restraints do not prevent major adverse consequences for residents; while the number of falls may increase with the removal of physical restraints, studies have consistently found that serious falls resulting in injuries do not (K&ouml;pke et al. 2012; Gulpers et al., 2011; Capezuti, 2004; Neufeld et al., 1995; Ejaz, Jones, &amp; Rose, 1994). Studies have shown that the risk of serious injury do not increase with decreased use of restraints (K&ouml;pke et al., 2012; Gulpers et al., 2011; Capezuti, 2004; Neufeld et al., 1995; Ejaz, Jones, &amp; Rose 1994) and may decrease when physical restraints are reduced in conjunction with appropriate education and training (Neufeld et al., 1995; Neufeld et al., 1999). </p>
<p>The use of restraints also increases the cost of care. One study examining almost 12,000 residents in 276 facilities in seven states found that higher levels of nursing-assistant time were consistently provided to restrained residents, resulting in increased staff costs to the facilities (Phillips, Hawes, &amp; Fries, 1993). A 1991 report by the Office of the Inspector General at CMS found that nursing homes were able to reduce the use of restraints with no increase in cost of care (Kusserow, 1991). Restraints may also impose additional costs on Medicaid; a 2006 analysis of Medicaid reimbursement data for 525 nursing homes found that residents who had experienced greater use of restraints experienced an increased risk of hospitalization (Carter &amp; Porell, 2006).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Race</strong></p>
<p>Analyses of racial/ethnic disparities were conducted at both the resident and facility levels using Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 data from Q2 2014. RTI found differences in daily restraint use between racial and ethnic groups of residents. Hispanic and Asian residents had the highest rates of restraint use, at 1.6% and 1.5% respectively, while 1.0 % of black residents and 1.2% of white residents had daily restraint use. Differences in the rate of restraint by racial/ethnic group were found to be statistically significant (p-value less than 0.0001). </p>
<p>RTI analyses of the distribution of facility scores on this measure by race indicate that facilities with different proportions of non-white populations do have different performance scores on this measure. Analyses at the facility level examined differences in the percent of residents who were physically restrained compared across two groups: facilities with proportions of white residents that were greater than or equal to the median proportion (87.0%), and facilities with fewer white residents than the median. Facilities with a higher proportion of white residents had slightly higher rates of restraint use (1.3% compared to 1.0%). In an additional analysis, the developer cross-tabulated racial composition (above/below median) with quality measure (QM) score (above/below median) and ran a 2-way Chi-square test for statistical dependence (with one degree of freedom). The results showed that there were statistically significant relationships between racial composition and the QM score (p-value less than 0.001).</p>
<p><strong>Socioeconomic Status</strong></p>
<p>RTI analyses of the distribution of facility scores on this measure by Medicaid eligibility indicate that facilities with different proportions of Medicaid-eligible populations do have different performance scores on this measure, suggesting a relationship between socioeconomic status and incidence of being restrained. Analyses at the facility level examined differences in the percent of residents who were physically restrained compared across two groups: facilities with proportions of Medicaid-eligible residents that were greater than or equal to the median proportion (75.0%), and facilities with fewer Medicaid-eligible residents than the median. This analysis showed that facilities with the higher proportion of Medicaid eligible residents had a slightly higher rate of restraint use (1.2% versus 0.7%). The developer cross-tabulated Medicaid eligibility rates (above/below median) with QM score (above/below median) and ran a 2-way Chi-square test for statistical dependence (with one degree of freedom). The results showed that there were statistically significant relationships between proportion of Medicaid eligible residents in a facility and facility QM score (p-value less than 0.001).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A joint RAND/Harvard team engaged in a deliberate iterative process to incorporate provider and consumer input, expert consultation, scientific advances in clinical knowledge about screening and assessment, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) experience, and intensive item development and testing by a national Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) consortium. This process allowed the final national testing of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 to include well-developed and tested items.</p>
<p>The national validation and evaluation of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (NHs) (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA NHs (764 residents), regionally distributed throughout the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze inter-rater agreement (reliability) between gold-standard (research) nurses and between facility and gold-standard nurses, validity of key sections, response rates for interview items, anonymous feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment.</p>
<p>Analysis of the test results showed that MDS 3.0 items had either excellent or very good reliability even when comparing research nurse to facility-nurse assessment. In most instances these were higher than those seen in the past with MDS 2.0. In addition, for the cognitive, mood and behavior items, national testing included collection of independent criterion or gold-standard measures. These MDS 3.0 sections were more highly matched to criterion measures than were MDS 2.0 items.</p>
<p>Improvements incorporated in MDS 3.0 produced a more efficient assessment: better quality information was obtained in less time. Such gains should improve identification of resident needs and enhance resident-focused care planning. In addition, including items recognized in other care settings is likely to enhance communication among providers. These significant gains reflect the cumulative effect of changes across the tool, including use of more valid items, direct inclusion of resident reports, improved clarity of retained items, deletion of poorly performing items, form redesign, and briefer assessment periods for clinical items.</p>
