Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Patients with resectable adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC)</strong>. Adjuvant mitotane has been shown to delay or prevent disease recurrence in patients with resected ACC. Adjuvant mitotane should be considered for use in this setting.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Mitotane is administered orally, beginning with a dose of 2&ndash;6 g per day, in divided doses given q 6 to 8 hours. The dose should then increase by 1 g per day, once every 1 to 2 weeks, to a maximum tolerated dose. The usual dose is 8&ndash;10 g per day, in divided doses, but the maximum tolerated dose may vary. The maximum dose should not exceed 19 g per day (British Columbia Cancer Agency, 2013). </li>
        <li>Patients with potential residual disease (R1 or Rx resection) and/or Ki67 more than 10% should be offered adjuvant mitotane. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Patients with advanced unresectable ACC</strong>. Mitotane-based combination therapy has been shown to slow disease progression in patients with advanced unresectable ACC. Therefore, mitotane-based combination therapy is recommended for use in this setting.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Combination therapy should consist of continuous oral mitotane titrated to a blood level of 14&ndash;20 mg/L, followed 1 week later by chemotherapy consistent with the recommendations from the FIRM-ACT study. Doxorubicin (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous [IV] on day 1), etoposide (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 2, 3, and 4), and cisplatin (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 3 and 4), given in 4-week cycles or streptozocin (1 g on days 1 to 5 in cycle 1; 2 g on day 1 in subsequent cycles) every 3 weeks are both options that can be considered for patients appropriate for treatment with chemotherapy (Fassnacht et al., 2012). </li>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (patient or population, intervention, comparisons, outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Does adjuvant mitotane delay recurrence or prolong survival in patients with resectable adrenocortical carcinoma? If so, what is the appropriate dosing regimen for mitotane in this setting? </li>
    <li>Does mitotane, in combination with other anti-tumour agents, prolong survival in patients with advanced unresectable adrenocortical carcinoma? If so, which combination is most effective, and at what dose, in this setting? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The PubMed and Medline databases were searched (1965 through 2013 July 16) for relevant publications using the following search terms: (<em>mitotane</em> or <em>lysodren</em>) and (<em>adrenocortical carcinoma</em> or [<em>adrenal gland</em> and <em>neoplasm</em>]). Results were limited to randomized controlled trials, phase II-III clinical trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines. In addition, the National Guideline Clearinghouse database was searched (2008 through 2013 July 16) for additional guidelines and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting abstracts database was searched (2011 through 2013 July 16) for relevant abstracts. A total of eleven and fifteen citations were returned from PubMed and Medline, respectively; seven were relevant and therefore included in the literature review. One ASCO abstract was included as well. No additional guidelines were identified in the National Guideline Clearinghouse database; however, protocols for the use of mitotane were retrieved from the BC Cancer Agency website.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Endocrine Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Trust Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p>
<p>Evidence is summarized in the table in Appendix B in the original guideline document.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Endocrine Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
