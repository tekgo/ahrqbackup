<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic</strong></p>
<p><em>Level I</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Computed tomography (CT) imaging to determine the condyle-C1 interval (CCI) in pediatric patients with potential atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) is recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Level III</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>If there is clinical or radiographic suspicion of AOD, CT of the craniocervical junction is recommended. The CCI determined on CT has the highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for AOD among all radiodiagnostic indicators in pediatric patients. The utility of CCI in adult patients has not been reported. </li>
    <li>A lateral cervical radiograph is recommended for the diagnosis of AOD. If a radiological method for measurement is used to determine AOD on the lateral radiograph, the basion-axial interval-basion dental interval (BAI-BDI) method is recommended. The presence of upper cervical prevertebral soft tissue swelling (STS) on an otherwise non-diagnostic plain cervical radiograph should prompt CT imaging to rule out AOD. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p><em>Level III</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Treatment with internal fixation and fusion using one of a variety of methods is recommended. </li>
    <li>Traction is not recommended in the management of patients with AOD, and is associated with a 10% risk of neurological deterioration. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>AOD is an uncommon traumatic injury that can be difficult to diagnose and is frequently missed on initial lateral cervical spinal radiographs. AOD is often associated with severe traumatic brain injuries. Patients who survive AOD injuries often have neurological impairment including lower cranial nerve deficits, unilateral or bilateral weakness, or quadriplegia. Nearly 20% of patients with acute traumatic AOD will have a normal neurological examination on presentation. The lack of localizing physical/neurological examination findings and/or global neurological deficits from severe brain injury may impede/hinder the diagnosis of AOD in patients with normal-appearing initial cervical radiographs. A high index of suspicion must be maintained in order to diagnose AOD. Prevertebral soft tissue swelling on a lateral cervical radiograph or craniocervical subarachnoid hemorrhage on axial CT images have been associated with AOD and should prompt consideration of the diagnosis. Additional imaging including CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be required to confirm the diagnosis of AOD if plain radiographs are inadequate. The CCI interval as determined on CT imaging has the highest diagnostic sensitivity and sensitivity for AOD among all other radio-diagnostic indicators.</p>
<p>All patients with AOD should be treated. Without treatment, nearly all patients developed neurological worsening, many of whom never fully recover. Treatment of AOD with traction is not recommended. Treatment with external immobilization has been used successfully in selected patients but has a high failure rate. Craniocervical fixation and fusion is recommended for the treatment of patients with acute traumatic AOD.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A National Library of Medicine computerized literature search of publications from 1966 to 2011 was performed using the following headings: "atlanto-occipital joint" and "dislocation." The search was limited to the English language and human studies. An exploded search of these headings led to 522 and 11,257 citations, respectively. A subset of 178 citations contained both headings. The references of the identified articles were reviewed to identify additional case reports. The articles were reviewed using the following criteria for inclusion in diagnosis: human survivors, type of traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation, and plain radiographic findings. The articles were also reviewed using the following criteria for inclusion in treatment: human survivors, type of traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation, management, and outcome. The observations from the published reports were combined because the usual methods for analysis were precluded by the infrequent observation of this injury. The type of dislocation was classified according to Traynelis et al into Type I (anterior), Type II (longitudinal), and Type III (posterior) dislocations. Lateral, rotational, and multi-directional dislocations that could not be classified into 1 of these 3 types were considered separately and are notated as "other Type." The duration of follow-up ranged from none reported to 4 years. Of the articles meeting the diagnostic selection criteria reported, 68 articles with 105 patients provided data on 38 Type I, 45 Type II, 4 Type III, and 18 other Types of AOD. Two of these articles included 1 patient each from 2 previously published individual case reports. Of the articles meeting the treatment selection criteria, 56 articles with 84 patients provided data on 31 Type I, 33 Type II, 4 Type III, and 16 other types of AOD. Two of these articles included 1 patient each from 2 previously published individual case reports. The information provided by these reports was compiled and scrutinized and make up the basis for this guideline.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Selected articles were carefully reviewed by the authors. Evidentiary tables were created (refer to Tables 1 and 2 in the original guideline document) that reflected the strengths and weaknesses of each article.</p>
<p>On occasion, the assessed quality of the study design was so contentious and the conclusions so uncertain that the guideline authors assigned a lower medical evidence classification than might have been expected without such a detailed review. In every way, adherence to the Institute of Medicine's criteria for searching, assembling, evaluating, and weighing the available medical evidence and linking it to the strength of the recommendations presented in this document was carried out.</p>
<p>Articles that did not achieve immediate consensus among the author group were discussed extensively until a consensus was reached. Very few contributions required extensive discussion. Most articles were easily designated as containing Class I, II, or III medical evidence using the criteria set forth by the author group at the initiation of the literature evaluation process (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
