<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination/Centre for Health Economics Technology Assessment Group, University of York (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clinical Effectiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Critique of the Methods of Review(s)</strong></p>
<p><em>Search Strategy</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer's submission (MS) described the search strategies used to identify relevant clinical effectiveness studies about the use of aflibercept for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) previously treated with an oxaliplatin-containing regimen.</p>
<p>The electronic databases MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (via PubMed), EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched to identify clinical studies on the use of aflibercept in the second-line treatment of mCRC. In addition to this, abstracts of conference proceedings from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) were reviewed.</p>
<p>Searches were conducted on 19 December 2012. The searches covered the period 1 January 1992 to December 2012, were limited to English language publications, and excluded animal studies. In addition, the EMBASE search strategy excluded all 'conference' publication types and the 'review' publication type. The manufacturer did not explain why the search was limited by date range and to only English language publications.</p>
<p>Overall the searches were appropriate and well documented, and included the use of both subject indexing terms (MeSH and EMTREE) and free text searching. Field searching, Boolean operators and truncation were used where required. All the databases required by NICE were searched, though only CENTRAL was searched in the Cochrane Library when it might have been useful to have searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database. Information about the EMBASE service provider was not provided, but was subsequently provided via the Points of Clarification letter.</p>
<p>There were some issues with the use of MeSH and EMTREE terms. The PubMed search strategy included both MeSH and Major MeSH index terms; Major MeSH terms are redundant when used alongside the equivalent MeSH terms. Further, the MeSH terms used ('Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Colonic Neoplasms' and 'Rectal Neoplasms') were not exploded, and so additional MeSH terms found further down the MeSH hierarchy would not have been searched for. In the EMBASE search strategy MESH terms are used instead of EMTREE terms in search line #1.</p>
<p>Other issues included: a missing Boolean operator (OR) in search line #2; a redundant search line (line #11); and unnecessary repetition of search terms (lines #4 and #36). The drug name aflibercept (and related terms) was not included in the search strategies and so it is possible that potentially useful records were not retrieved. The search strategies used in the manufacturer's submission were limited to RCTs and phase II and phase III trials, however a search for other study designs such as cohort or case control studies may have provided useful supplementary information about safety. It is not clear if the methodological search filters used in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were derived from validated search filters. The addition of the following EMTREE terms would have improved the filter used in EMBASE: 'Randomized Controlled Trial' and 'Controlled Clinical Trial'.</p>
<p>Despite the issues identified above, the searches were appropriate and comprehensive, and included the use of both subject indexing terms and free text searching. Field searching, Boolean operators and truncation were used where required. It is unlikely that any relevant studies have been missed. No separate search strategy was undertaken to identify relevant studies for the meta-analysis of the adverse effects of aflibercept.</p>
<p><em>Inclusion Criteria</em></p>
<p>RCTs of all current second-line chemotherapy regimens (including, but not limited to, bevacizumab; irinotecan; folinic acid/5-fluorouracil/irinotecan [FOLFIRI]; folinic acid/5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin 4 [FOLFOX4]; FOLFOX6; capecitabine/oxaliplatin [capeOX, XELOX]) compared with placebo, best supportive care or the same or a different second-line chemotherapy regimen, for adult patients with mCRC were eligible for inclusion in the review. Trials had to assess outcomes relating to survival, progression, response, adverse effects or quality of life to be included in the review. Only English language articles were eligible for inclusion. The inclusion criteria were appropriate for a systematic review of all second-line chemotherapy regimens for adult patients with mCRC. It appears that at the study selection stage the inclusion criteria were narrowed down so that the only intervention eligible for inclusion in the review was aflibercept.</p>
<p>No inclusion criteria were presented for the meta-analysis of the adverse effects of aflibercept.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>ERG Comment on Manufacturer's Review of Cost-effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p><em>Searches</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer's submission described the search strategies used to identify cost-effectiveness studies relevant to this appraisal of aflibercept for the treatment of mCRC. The review was performed as part of a wider systematic review aimed to identify utility, resource use and cost estimates relevant to the appraisal. Search strategies were only briefly described in the main submission, however full details were provided in the Appendix 10 of the MS.</p>
<p>The electronic databases MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (via PubMed), EMBASE (Dialog), EconLit (EBSCO), the Cochrane Library (Wiley) including the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database were searched. In addition to this, abstracts of conference proceedings from ASCO, ESMO, World Conference on Gastrointestinal Cancer, and International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) were searched. Regulatory organisation websites were also searched, including NICE, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), and the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG).</p>
<p>Database searches were performed on 27 June 2012. Internet searches were performed between 27 June and 6 July 2012. The searches covered the period 2010 to 27 June 2012. Searches were not performed for publications before 2010 because the NICE multiple-technology appraisal for cetuximab, bevacizumab, and panitumumab was published that year and provided relevant economic literature to that point. Further, the manufacturer did not expect there to be any aflibercept economic analyses prior to 2010. The searches were limited to English language publications, and excluded animal studies as well as the publication types 'review' and 'case reports', and the MeSH term 'Review Literature as Topic'.</p>
<p>The searches were appropriate and comprehensive, and included the use of both subject indexing terms and free text searching. Field searching, Boolean operators and truncation were used where required. All NICE required databases were searched, as well as abstracts of conference proceedings and regulatory body websites. An update of the searches closer to submission might have been useful.</p>
<p>Methodological search filters were included to identify economic studies and utilities in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. The economic study design search filter may have excluded potentially useful records from the NHS EED database in the Cochrane Library search as this database is already limited by study design.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Used for Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>The manufacturer undertook a series of systematic searches to identify published economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility analyses, as well as utility, resource use and cost studies. The ERG believes that the inclusion/exclusion criteria were appropriate, and would have identified any relevant studies.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination/Centre for Health Economics Technology Assessment Group, University of York (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>

<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently extracted data from the included study, reducing the potential for error or bias. The manufacturer's submission (MS) presented adequate data from the Aflibercept Versus Placebo in Combination With Irinotecan and 5-FU in the Colorectal Cancer After Failure of an Oxaliplatin Based Regimen (VELOUR) trial.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The quality of the VELOUR trial was assessed using appropriate criteria specific to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and a table of the quality assessment results was presented. Quality assessment results were checked by the ERG.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>No meta-analysis of efficacy outcomes was undertaken as only one study of aflibercept in the second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was identified in the systematic review.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis of aflibercept adverse events was presented, including the VELOUR trial, the VITAL trial and the VANILLA trial.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>ERG Comment on Manufacturer's Review of Cost-effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p><em>Conclusions of the Systematic Review</em></p>
<p>There is a paucity of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of aflibercept. The only study, identified by the ERG, was conducted in the United States (US) and established a comparison against a treatment that was not considered a relevant comparator within this appraisal, and therefore of limited relevance. Furthermore, there is a lack of detail that precludes any formal quality assessment of the study.</p>
<p><strong>Summary and Critique of Manufacturer's Submitted Economic Evaluation by the ERG</strong></p>
<p><em>Model Structure</em></p>
<p>The <em>de novo</em> analysis presented by the manufacturer uses a three health state Markov model (see Figure 5 in the ERG report [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The three states are: i) Stable (non-progressive) disease; ii) Progressive disease (PD); and iii) Death. The stable state is further subpartitioned into "On second-line treatment" and "Discontinued second-line treatment". Patients enter the model in the stable state and the second-line treatment substate. At each 14 days cycle, patients can either remain on second-line treatment or can discontinue second-line treatment while continuing to remain stable. Patients can also transition through the model to progressive disease (PD) or Death from either of the stable states. No reversion from the PD state to the stable state is possible.</p>
<p>Refer to Table 5.1 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for a summary of the manufacturer's economic evaluation. Refer to Section 5.2 of the ERG report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for more information on cost-effectiveness methods.</p>
<p><em>The Manufacturer's Economic Evaluation Compared to the NICE Reference Case Checklist</em></p>
<p>The manufacturer's base case economic evaluation meets the criteria of the NICE reference case checklist (see Table 5.2 of the ERG report [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). No evidence synthesis was undertaken of efficacy outcomes as only one study of aflibercept in the second-line treatment of mCRC was identified in the systematic review. The ERG has been informed by their clinical advisor that other treatments (e.g., panitumumab, cetuximab and bevacizumab) are being used in clinical practice but it is not clear that this use could be considered representative of routine clinical practice, nor are any of these other treatments approved by NICE for this indication.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Technology appraisal recommendations are based on a review of clinical and economic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Appraisal Process</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invites 'consultee' and 'commentator' organisations to take part in the appraisal process. Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.</p>
<p>Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.</p>
<p>NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.</p>
<p>An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.</p>
<p>When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.</p>
<p>Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?</strong></p>
<p>NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions on the Evidence for Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability and Nature of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The Committee concluded that overall the manufacturer's model adhered to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reference case for assessing cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered that the manufacturer's assumption that the treatment benefit continues beyond the trial period and until 15 years is highly uncertain given that most patients had died during the 3-year follow-up period of the trial. The Committee considered that the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) analysis that allows the hazard ratio to become greater than 1.0 could be considered implausible. The Committee agreed that the ERG's scenario, which assumes equal risk of death for all patients beyond the trial period (hazard ratio equals 1.0), represents an acceptable compromise between the 2 extremes of assuming continuing treatment effect (manufacturer's base case) and allowing for a reversed treatment effect (ERG's second scenario). The Committee noted that, in response to consultation, the manufacturer implemented a new scenario in its revised base case in which the hazard ratio begins to taper to 1.0 36 months after starting treatment, over a 12-month period. The Committee agreed that as a means to extrapolate overall survival both its preferred scenario (that is, the ERG's first scenario) and the manufacturer's new scenario were associated with some degree of uncertainty. In the absence of further evidence to validate the manufacturer's new approach, the Committee maintained its preference for the ERG's first scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee was aware that the manufacturer got the utility value for the stable-disease state from the 'mCRC utilities study' and revised it after consultation to a value derived from the ASQoP (an international single-arm open-label phase III study of aflibercept). The Committee noted that the ERG preferred another value from the ASQoP study for the stable-disease state. The Committee concluded that either value could be considered appropriate.</p>
<p>The Committee considered that the utility value chosen by the manufacturer for the progressed-disease state did not reflect the entire duration of progressed disease but only early progressed disease, and so was likely to be an overestimate. The Committee was aware that, in its base case, the ERG used an alternative lower value of 0.60, which had been used in the NICE guideline <a href="http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA118" title="NICE Web site">Bevacizumab and cetuximab for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer</a> (Technology appraisal guidance 118). The Committee agreed that no utility values for progressed disease were universally accepted as valid, but that it would be important that the utility value reflected the entire progressed-disease state. The Committee also agreed that adjusting the utility values for age was appropriate. The Committee concluded that the most plausible utility value for the progressed-disease health state would lie between the manufacturer's and the ERG's estimate.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that all benefits of a substantial nature relating to treatment with aflibercept plus fluorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) had been captured in the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?</strong></p>
<p>Having considered the clinical evidence presented by the manufacturer for the 2 subgroups, the Committee concluded that it did not need to consider the cost-effectiveness of the technology for any of the subgroups.</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?</strong></p>
<p>The Committee considered the robustness of the mean overall survival benefit, obtained using the log-logistic function, of 3 months (5 years extrapolation time), 4.7 months (15 years extrapolation time) and 6.6 months (without truncating the survival curves).</p>
<p>The Committee was aware that the longer the time horizon, the greater the influence of the 'tails' of the extrapolation curves, which define the difference in mean overall survival between the treatment arms, and to which the model is highly sensitive.</p>
<p>The Committee noted that, because approximately three-quarters of the QALY gain in the model was accrued after disease progression, the model is highly sensitive to utility value for the progressed-disease state in the model.</p>
<p><strong>Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)</strong></p>
<p>The Committee noted that the manufacturer's incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) closest to its preferred assumptions was &pound;44,000 per QALY gained (for age 60), but would increase for the higher age bracket, if the mean value was used from the manufacturer's survey of clinical oncologists after removing the outlier and if an extrapolation function with a less heavy tail had been used. Because the manufacturer's ICERs incorporated a utility value for progressed disease deemed by the Committee to be high, the Committee considered the ICER produced by the ERG using the Committee's preferred assumptions, but which used a utility value for progressed disease of 0.6. The Committee noted that this was approximately &pound;51,000 per QALY gained and would be higher if an extrapolation function with a less heavy tail had been used. The Committee therefore concluded that the most plausible ICER was higher than the normally acceptable maximum ICER range of &pound;20,000&ndash;30,000 per QALY gained.</p>
