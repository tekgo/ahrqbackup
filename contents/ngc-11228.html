Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This provisional clinical opinion (PCO) addresses the following main research question: Do second-line hormonal therapies play a role in the treatment of chemotherapy-na&iuml;ve men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>Should a castrate state be maintained in patients who develop CRPC?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 1</strong></p>
<p>For men who develop CRPC despite castrate levels of testosterone:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients should be maintained in a castrate state indefinitely. This PCO is based on indirect scientific evidence and current understandings of disease progression mechanisms in prostate cancer. A discussion with patients about the limited nature of available scientific evidence and the balance among potential harms, benefits, costs, and patient preferences is essential when planning treatment. </li>
    <li>A castrate state should be maintained through orchiectomy or pharmacologic castration (e.g., luteinizing hormone&ndash;releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists/antagonists, antiandrogens). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>In chemotherapy-naıve patients who develop CRPC but have no radiographic evidence of metastases (M0 CRPC), should second-line hormonal therapies be used? If so, what agents or specific sequence of agents should be offered?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 2</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For chemotherapy-na&iuml;ve patients believed to be at low risk for metastases (low prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and slow PSA doubling time) (Pound et al., 1999; Scher et al., 2016), second-line hormonal therapies are not suggested. </li>
    <li>For chemotherapy-na&iuml;ve patients at high risk of developing metastases (rapid PSA doubling time or velocity), second-line hormonal therapies that lower PSA values or slow the rate of PSA rise may be offered (preferably in a clinical trial setting where available) after discussion with the patient about limited scientific evidence, potential harms, benefits, costs, and patient preferences. </li>
    <li>Alternative treatment options include observation (with maintenance of a castrate state) or participation in a clinical trial. </li>
    <li>Chemotherapy or immunotherapy is not suggested except in a clinical trial. </li>
    <li>No evidence provides guidance about the optimal order of hormonal therapies after second-line hormonal therapy for high-risk chemotherapy-naıve patients with M0 CRPC. The panel was unable to come to consensus about sequencing. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>In chemotherapy-na&iuml;ve patients who develop CRPC and have radiographic evidence of metastases but minimal symptoms (M1a/ M1s CRPC), should second-line hormonal therapies be used? If so, what agents are recommended?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 3</strong></p>
<p>After first-line hormonal treatment failure and a discussion with chemotherapy-na&iuml;ve patients about potential harms, benefits, costs, and patient preferences: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone should be offered because they significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) as well as secondary end points, including median time to opiate use, chemotherapy initiation, performance status deterioration, and PSA progression (v prednisone alone). The drugs are also well tolerated. </li>
    <li>Enzalutamide should be offered because it significantly improves rPFS and OS. Secondary end points are also improved, including time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, risk of a first skeletal-related event, complete or partial soft tissue response, time to PSA progression, time to deterioration in quality of life, and decline in PSA of &ge;50% from baseline (v placebo). The drug is also well tolerated. </li>
    <li>Alternative treatment options include immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T) (Kantoff et al., 2010), chemotherapy (docetaxel and prednisone) (Basch et al., 2014), and radium-223. </li>
    <li>If none of these therapies can be obtained or tolerated by the patient, other antiandrogens, prednisone, and ketoconazole/hydrocortisone may be offered because they provide modest clinical benefits in this population, but no survival benefits have been established. </li>
    <li>Other alternative treatment options include enrollment in a clinical trial and observation. </li>
    <li>No evidence provides guidance about the optimal order of hormonal therapies after second-line hormonal therapy for patients with M1 CRPC. The panel was unable to come to a consensus about sequencing. </li>
    <li>Other second-line hormonal therapy options where results from phase III trials are pending are not suggested. </li>
    <li>Palliative care should be offered to all chemotherapy-naıve men with M1 CRPC, particularly to those who exhibit symptoms or decreased quality of life (refer to the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the ASCO guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/50609/" title="Guideline #11128" target="_blank">Integration of palliative care into standard oncology care: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update</a>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>How often should patients with CRPC undergo PSA monitoring?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 4</strong></p>
<p>No evidence provides guidance about the optimal frequency of PSA monitoring before starting second-line hormonal therapy or after treatment has begun.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For patients with no radiographic evidence of metastases and a slow PSA doubling time (Pound et al., 1999; Scher et al., 2016) or velocity, a PSA evaluation every 4 to 6 months is reasonable. If PSA levels rise, checking serum testosterone levels should be considered. </li>
    <li>For patients with a rapid PSA doubling time, velocity, or radiographic evidence of metastases, a PSA evaluation every 3 months is reasonable. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p>What imaging modalities are appropriate for patients with CRPC?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 5</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>When imaging is considered for patients both before and while receiving treatment, a bone scan and either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis are reasonable. </li>
    <li>Imaging with fluorine-18 (<sup>18</sup>F)-labeled positron emission tomography (<sup>18</sup>FPET) generally is not recommended because it is currently only approved in the United States for the diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer among men with elevated PSA after treatment. The use of this technique is otherwise limited to patients who participate in clinical trials and prospective registries. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p>How often should patients with CRPC undergo radiographic imaging or routine radiographic restaging?</p>
<p><strong>PCO 6</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Radiographic imaging is not indicated for men with rising PSA unless treatment selection would be altered on the basis of radiographic findings or if symptoms potentially attributed to prostate cancer develop or worsen (e.g., bone pain). </li>
    <li>Routine radiographic restaging generally is not recommended, except among patients in whom PSA is not a reliable marker of disease. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) provisional clinical opinions (PCOs) are based in part on systematic reviews of the literature. A protocol for each systematic review defines parameters for a targeted literature search. Additional parameters include relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature identified. The protocol for this PCO was reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee's Genitourinary Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PCO Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>This PCO was informed by a systematic review of the available evidence, consensus opinion, and clinical experience. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence on the basis of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Chemotherapy-naive men with nonmetastatic or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who were being considered for second-line hormonal therapy </li>
    <li>Measured effect of continued hormonal interventions in patients with CRPC for at least one primary measure of therapeutic efficacy, such as radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression or time to progression in general, and median duration of response </li>
    <li>A minimum of 25 patients per trial arm </li>
</ul>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; and (3) published in a non-English language. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The search included the MEDLINE (PubMed: 1985 through June 2015), and Cochrane Library databases to May 31, 2014). Conference proceedings from the 2010&ndash;2015 ASCO Annual and Genitourinary meetings were also searched for randomized controlled trials reporting on outcomes of interest. Reference lists of seminal papers and recent review articles were scanned for additional citations. Literature search terms included castration-resistant prostate cancer, androgen-independent prostate cancer, and hormone therapy. Further details on the search strategy and results are provided in the accompanying Data Supplement 1 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Search results were reviewed by the Practice Guidelines Specialist and papers deemed eligible for full text review were obtained and data were extracted. These data were also reviewed by the lead authors and audited by a second American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the lead authors if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study quality was formally assessed for the studies identified. For the ASCO quality assessment, design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer and included factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, etc. The risk of bias is assessed as "low," "intermediate," or "high" for the identified evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Assessment of the Literature</span></strong></p>
<p>The modest number of randomly assigned patients in the majority of the identified trials created obstacles with respect to determination of the true efficacy or generalizability of the findings. An additional challenge with the data identified by the systematic review was the lack of similar treatment arms; no two trials included the same comparisons. The largest trial included 1,717 participants. However, most of the remaining trials included fewer than 140 patients per comparison arm. The trial of abiraterone acetate in chemotherapy-naive patients reported significant progression-free survival (PFS) results, which led to the trial being stopped early. The enzalutamide trial in chemotherapy-naive patients also reported a PFS advantage and was stopped early. Patients were offered crossover in both studies.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expert Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel that comprised prostate cancer experts with specific knowledge in and clinical experience with CRPC, including specialists from medical oncology, urologic oncology, radiation oncology, and guideline methodology. Academic and community practitioners were represented as were patients.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consensus Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>In addition to the Expert Panel, the ASCO CPGC also convened a Consensus Panel, with similar representation to the Expert Panel, tasked with rating agreement with the drafted provisional clinical opinions (PCOs) by using ASCO's formal consensus-based methodology. This approach is based on the modified Delphi consensus development methodology for providing clinical guidance when available data do not support more traditional and definitive evidence-based recommendations. Results of the consensus ratings can be found in Data Supplement 8 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PCO Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel, who met via teleconference and corresponded through email, was asked to contribute to the development of the PCO, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the PCO in consideration of the evidence. The Expert Panel was supplemented by additional experts recruited to rate their agreement with the drafted PCOs as part of the consensus process. The entire membership of experts is referred to as the Consensus Panel. The Expert Panel and ASCO staff prepared the draft PCOs for review and rating by the Consensus Panel.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of the PCO</span></strong></p>
<p>The PCOs were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software<sup>TM</sup>. This method helps panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable guidance using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Members of the Expert Panel are responsible for drafting the penultimate version of the provisional clinical opinion (PCO), which is then circulated for external review and submitted to the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> for editorial review and publication. All American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) PCOs are reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Committee prior to publication. The Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) approved the guideline on February 7, 2017.</p>
<p>The PCO is approved by a unanimous vote of (1) the PCO Expert Panel members; (2) the CPGC leadership (Past-Chair, Chair, Chair-Elect, and ASCO Board Liaison) and selected content experts drawn from the CPGC membership and/or selected content experts appointed at the discretion of the CPGC Chair.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Goals of treatment in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer include chemotherapy deferral and palliation, that is, symptom relief with extension of life while maximizing quality of life for as long as possible or as a pre-emptive intervention against symptoms. Despite resistance to initial androgen deprivation therapy (first-line hormonal therapy), most men respond to second-line hormonal therapies.</p>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Multiple adverse effects and harms were reported with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), including hot flushes, fatigue, impotence, gynecomastia, loss of libido, osteoporosis, and a risk for metabolic syndrome. </li>
    <li>According to the manufacturer's warnings and precautions, abiraterone acetate should be used with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Drug safety was not established in patients with a left-ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% or with New York Heart Association class II to IV disease. Abiraterone acetate can cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention. Low risks of adrenocortical insufficiency or hepatotoxicity also are associated with abiraterone acetate use. A low risk of seizure associated with enzalutamide use exists; however, among chemotherapy-na&iuml;ve patients, the risk (0.1%) was similar between those who received enzalutamide and those who received placebo. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome also has been associated with enzalutamide use, which required discontinuation of the drug. </li>
