<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) stroke patients for whom a severity measurement (i.e., Hunt and Hess Scale for SAH patients or ICH Score for ICH patients) is performed prior to surgical intervention (e.g., clipping, coiling, or any surgical intervention) in patients undergoing surgical intervention and documented in the medical record, OR documented within 6 hours of arrival at the hospital emergency department for patients who do not undergo surgical intervention.</p>
<p>This measure represents the overall rate. The following rates are also reported:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Hunt and Hess Scale performed for SAH patients </li>
    <li>ICH Score performed for ICH patients </li>
</ul></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are medical emergencies requiring rapid diagnosis and assessment. Early deterioration is common in the first few hours after onset, and associated with increased mortality rates of greater than 75% compared to 30-day mortality rates of 35% to 52%. More than half of all deaths from these conditions occur within the first two days. According to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, the severity of SAHs should be documented with the Hunt and Hess Scale, and the severity of ICHs should be documented with ICH score to capture the clinical state of the patient. The severity of initial neurological injury should be determined and documented in the emergency department because it is a useful predictor of outcome and helpful in planning future care with family and physicians. For both severity methodologies, higher scores are associated with increased mortality.</p></div>
