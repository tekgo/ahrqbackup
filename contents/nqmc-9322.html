<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase percentage of patients age 18 years and older who are evaluated for osteoporosis risk factors during an annual preventive visit.</p>
<p>Osteoporosis is a generalized skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength and deterioration of bone quality, often leading to fragility (low trauma) fractures. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines osteoporosis as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations or more below a reference group of young Caucasian females (WHO, 2004). A low bone mass is frequently found, but not required, for the diagnosis. (A fragility fracture, regardless of the bone mass, necessitates the diagnosis.) Osteoporosis is by far the most common bone disease (WHO, 2004). Osteoporosis can be a primary disorder or can be caused by a host of other factors (e.g., diseases, lifestyle, medications, etc.). The impact of this disorder is massive in terms of cost, morbidity and mortality. An estimated 1.5 million individuals suffer a fragility fracture annually (Riggs et al., 1998). An estimated 40% of women and 25% to 33% of men during their lifetime will suffer a hip, spine or wrist fracture in their lifetime (Binkley et al., 2006). Projections indicate a two- to threefold increase in osteoporosis by 2040 (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2012).</p>
<p>The major challenges facing this field currently include low rates of initial screening with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), lack of initial treatment in cases with a high fracture risk, and poor adherence with prescribed treatment.</p>
<p>Defining a group of individuals at "high risk" for osteoporosis is in fact daunting, because clinical risk factors in the absence of bone densitometry have poor sensitivity and specificity for osteoporosis. The use of the FRAX&reg; fracture risk calculation should aid in stratifying fracture risk more accurately. There is, nonetheless, broad consensus that assessment of clinical risk factors should be done to determine who should have a bone density test. Similarly, there is broad consensus that mass population screening of all individuals or even of all postmenopausal women is neither cost effective nor appropriate. Many professional organizations, including the USPSTF, National Osteoporosis Foundation, the North American Menopause Society, the Endocrine Society, National Institutes of Health, American College of Physicians, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Rheumatology have published their own guidelines describing whom to select for bone densitometry. </p>
<p>The USPSTF advises bone densitometry for all women age 65 and over and younger if risk is equal to 65 year olds without other risk factors (9.3%) from FRAX&reg; analysis (USPSTF, 2011). However, in 2004, no more than 45% of these women actually were tested (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2004). </p>
<p>Measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) with DXA can predict fracture risk and allow for the identification of people who are at increased risk of fracture. Reviews of prospective cohort studies and case control studies have documented a direct relationship between decreasing BMD and increasing bone fracture risk. Additionally, there is evidence that stabilization or increases in BMD with therapy for osteoporosis are associated with substantial reductions in fracture incidence. Therefore, densitometry offers an objective measurement of a patient's response to treatment over time (Hailey et al., 1998; Miller &amp; Bonnick, 1999).</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Of the types of fractures, the most devastating effects are from hip fractures. Most of these occur after a fall, which are more frequent with aging. The one-year mortality rate of a hip fracture is approximately 28% in women and 35% in men (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2004). Some, but not all, of these deaths would be avoided with preventive interventions. Twenty-five percent of these patients will become disabled, and many will require long-term nursing home placement (Ray, 1997). Given the aging population, the frequency, cost and burden of fractures will continue to increase. </li>
    <li>Annual direct care expenditures for osteoporotic fractures ranged from $12.2 billion to $17.9 billion in 1999. This constitutes 7% of total health care costs for women over the age of 45 (Hoerger, 1999). </li>
    <li>It is estimated that 50% of women over age 50 will develop a fracture in their remaining lifetime and the annualized risk increases with age. Twenty-five percent of women over age 50 will experience an osteoporotic vertebral fracture, so that by age 75 more than one in three women has sustained at least one vertebral fracture. </li>
