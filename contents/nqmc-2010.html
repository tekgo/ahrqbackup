<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of HIV positive adolescent and adult patients who reported how often they could get someone on the phone to discuss a medical question.</p>

<p>This measure is part of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for HIV Ambulatory Care (PSS-HIV) -- Core Measures.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patient satisfaction has recently emerged as an important measure of the quality of health care delivery, right alongside the more traditional health status measurements and quality of life indicators. This is based largely on the discovery that patients with higher satisfaction levels often make important behavioral changes, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintaining more stable relationships with health care providers</li>
<li>Complying more closely with medical advice and treatment</li>
<li>Keeping appointments</li></ul>

<p>Patients with higher satisfaction levels may also have improved health outcomes.</p>

<p>Many HIV providers have been measuring patient satisfaction at their HIV programs for some time. Others are just beginning. Measuring patient satisfaction will help to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strengthen communication and build relations with patients</li>
<li>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of HIV programs from the patients' perspective</li>
<li>Focus the quality improvement efforts</li>
<li>Create baseline data against which to measure changes in patient satisfaction</li></ul>

<p>Taken together, these outcomes represent key opportunities to make and monitor the changes required to achieve some important goals: improving patient satisfaction and improving care overall.</p></div>
