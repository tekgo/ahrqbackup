Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of Medicare members:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>75 years of age and older, <strong>or</strong> </li>
    <li>65 to 74 years of age with balance or walking problems or a fall in the past 12 months </li>
</ul>
<p>who were seen by a Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO) practitioner in the past 12 months and who discussed falls or problems with balance or walking with their current practitioner.</p>
<p>This measure is collected using the Medicare Health Outcome Survey (HOS). Results are calculated by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) using data collected in the combined baseline and follow-up survey samples from the same measurement year.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Unintentional injuries are the fifth leading cause of death in older adults, and falls are responsible for two-thirds of these deaths (Clark, Lord, &amp; Webster, 1993). Falls can have serious psychological and social consequences. Many elderly people who fall develop a fear of subsequent falls, which can result in self-imposed functional limitations. Of those older adults who fall, 20 percent to 30 percent suffer moderate to severe injuries that may reduce mobility and independence, as well as increase the risk of premature death (Sterling, O'Connor, &amp; Bonadies, 2001; Grisso et al., 1992). Recurrent falls are a common reason for the need for long-term care; a recent study found that falls were a significant factor in 40 percent of admissions to long-term care (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disorders, n.d.; National Institutes of Health [NIH]  Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases-National Resource Center, n.d.).</p>
<p>Because falls have the potential to cause serious harm and significantly limit functional status of the elderly, a clinical practice to routinely monitor and manage risk factors can have significant impact in preventing unintentional injuries from falls. The American Geriatrics Society, along with the British Geriatrics Society and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, published clinical practice guidelines for the prevention of falls in older people ("Guideline," 2001).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Falls are the leading cause of death by injury in people 65 years of age and older: one in three seniors falls (American Geriatrics Society [AGS], 2010). Falls can cause hip fractures and head wounds, increasing the risk of early death and inducing fear that can reduce mobility and cause depression and social isolation (AGS, 2010; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2008). </li>
    <li>In 2012, the cost of fall injuries totaled more than $36 billion. As the population ages, the financial toll for older-adult falls is projected to reach $59.6 billion by 2020 (National Council on Aging [NCOA], 2012). </li>
    <li>Falls result in more than 2.4 million injuries treated in emergency rooms (ERs) annually, including more than 772,000 hospitalizations and more than 21,700 deaths (NCOA, 2012). </li>
    <li>Every 15 seconds, an older adult is treated in the ER for a fall. Every 29 minutes, an older adult dies after a fall (NCOA, 2012). </li>
    <li>Falls are a threat to the health and independence of older adults (people 65 and older) (NCOA, 2012). The majority of falls could be prevented through evidence-based interventions, initial discussions with practitioners about future risk of falls and practical lifestyle adjustments (NCOA, 2012). </li>
