Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>A-C</strong>) and strength of recommendation (strong [grade<strong> 1</strong>], weak [grade<strong> 2</strong>]) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variables for the Assessment of Functional Iron Deficiency or Iron-Restricted Erythropoiesis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Red Cell Variables</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Mean cell volume (MCV) and mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) values are useful at diagnosis and in assessing trends over periods of weeks or months. They have no use in assessing acute changes in iron availability secondary to therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The percentage of hypochromic red cells (%HRC) is the best-established variable for the identification of functional iron deficiency (FID) and thus has the greatest level of evidence. Reticulocyte haemoglobin content (CHr) is the next most established option. Both tests have limitations in terms of sample stability or equipment availability. Other parameters may be as good but there is no evidence that they are any better, and generally there is less evidence for newer red cell and reticulocyte parameters. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>A CHr value &lt;29 pg predicts FID in patients receiving ESA therapy. A reticulocyte haemoglobin equivalent (Ret-He) value &lt;25 pg is suggestive of classical iron deficiency and also predicts FID in those receiving ESA therapy. (<strong>1B</strong>) A Ret-He value &lt;30&middot;6 pg appears to have the best predictive value for likelihood of response to intravenous iron therapy in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on haemodialysis. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The measurement of red cell zinc protoporphyrin concentration provides a sensitive index of FID and may be used as an alternative to indices of red blood cell (RBC) hypochromia or reticulocyte haemoglobin content, although it is less sensitive than these to acute changes in iron availability. If used in the assessment of FID in CKD patients it is essential that measurements be made on washed cells, with the use of appropriate reference limits. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Iron Stores</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cytological Assessment of Iron Stores</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Bone marrow examination for the sole purpose of assessing iron stores is rarely justifiable. It may be helpful if there are concerns that a high serum ferritin value (&gt;1200 &micro;g/l) is not a true reflection of the bone marrow iron storage pool. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Serum Ferritin</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The serum ferritin assay is essential in the assessment and management of patients with all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis (IRE) including FID. Values &lt;12 &micro;g/l indicate absent iron stores. (<strong>1A</strong>) Values as high as 1200 &micro;g/l in CKD patients do not exclude the possibility of FID and some such patients may respond to intravenous iron therapy. No recommendation as to the highest serum ferritin concentration beyond which it is unsafe to give a trial of intravenous iron therapy can be given. A serum ferritin concentration &lt;100 &micro;g/l in nondialysed patients or &lt;200 &micro;g/l in chronic haemodialysis patients is associated with a high likelihood of iron deficiency and a potentially good response to intravenous iron therapy. (<strong>1A</strong>) Values above the suggested cut-offs given above should therefore not be used to guide iron therapy. Serum ferritin values &gt;1200 &micro;g/l should be used to ascertain whether investigation of potential iron overload should be undertaken. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The serum ferritin concentration is not useful in predicting ESA responsiveness in cancer-related anaemia (<strong>1A</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soluble Transferrin Receptor</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) assay is relatively expensive, not widely available, and is not currently subject to external quality assessment (EQA) in the UK. An International Standard may improve assay standardization. The treatment of renal anaemia with ESAs, which increase sTfR, is a complicating factor. The assay may have a role, either alone or in combination with the ferritin assay, if automated measures such as %HRC, CHr or Ret-He are unavailable. (<strong>1B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Serum Iron, Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC) and %Saturation (%Sat)</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In isolation the percentage saturation of transferrin is not recommended as a predictor of responsiveness to intravenous iron therapy in patients with CKD. It may be used to monitor response to ESA and/or iron therapy in CKD. It may be used to monitor response to ESA and/or iron in CKD. When used with either the serum ferritin concentration or measurement such as %HRC and CHr it may be useful in the diagnosis of FID. (<strong>1A</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Erythropoietin</strong></p>
<ul ytpe="disc">
    <li>The measurement of serum erythropoietin concentration in the setting of anaemia has limited value in the diagnosis of FID. (<strong>1A</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hepcidin</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The utility of hepcidin measurement as a diagnostic tool is currently uncertain and for the time being this technique remains a research investigation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence is graded as high (A), moderate (B) or low (C). To put this in context, it is useful to consider the uncertainty of knowledge and whether further research could change what we know or our certainty.</p>
<p><strong>(A) High</strong>: Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect. Current evidence derived from randomized clinical trials without important limitations.</p>
<p><strong>(B) Moderate</strong>: Further research may well have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Current evidence derived from randomized clinical trials with important limitations (e.g., inconsistent results, imprecision &ndash; wide confidence intervals or methodological flaws &ndash; e.g., lack of blinding, large losses to follow up, failure to adhere to intention to treat analysis), or very strong evidence from observational studies or case series (e.g., large or very large and consistent estimates of the magnitude of a treatment effect or demonstration of a dose-response gradient).</p>
<p><strong>(C) Low</strong>: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Current evidence from observational studies, case series or just opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong (grade 1)</strong>: Strong recommendations (grade 1) are made when there is confidence do or do not outweigh harm and burden. Grade 1 recommendations can be applied uniformly to most patients. Regard as 'recommend'.</p>
<p><strong>Weak (grade 2)</strong>: Where the magnitude of benefit or not is less certain a weaker grade 2 recommendation is made. Grade 2 recommendations require judicious application to individual patients. Regard as 'suggest'.</p></div>
