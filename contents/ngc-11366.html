Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Weak, Good Clinical Practice [GCP]</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Risk/Comorbidity Factors</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>Does the administration of 21% oxygen versus the administration of 100% oxygen during the resuscitation of newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with asphyxia reduce neurological morbidity and mortality?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks that require ventilation due to apnea and bradycardia at birth, the guideline development group (GDG) suggests not beginning the administration of 100% O<sub>2</sub>. (<strong>Weak</strong>)</p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks that require ventilation due to apnea and bradycardia at birth, the GDG suggests beginning resuscitation with ambient air or intermediate concentrations of oxygen and suggest that the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> be adjusted according to the patient's clinical response and saturation. (<strong>GCP</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Is an Apgar score of 0 at 10 minutes in newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks that develop hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) always related to neurological mortality or morbidity?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Given that an Apgar score of 0 at 10 minutes is not always related to death or moderate/severe neurological disability, the GDG suggests not using this data by itself to make the decision to limit the therapeutic effort and interrupt resuscitation measures at 10 minutes of life. (<strong>Weak</strong>) </p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks that show an Apgar score of 0 at 10 minutes of life, the GDG suggests considering a delay in the decision to limit the therapeutic effort. Delaying this decision from 10 minutes of life (Apgar at 10 minutes) to making it in the first hours of life (72 hours) could allow having the results of diagnostic tests that have greater prognostic value and knowing the preferences of the parents. (<strong>GCP</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Which of the following factors occurring in newborns with perinatal HIE during the first 72 hours of life (hyperthermia, hypo/hypercapnia, hypo/hyperglycaemia) are associated with greater neurological morbidity and mortality?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, the GDG recommends avoiding hyperthermia in the first 72 hours of life. (<strong>Strong</strong>) </p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, the GDG recommends avoiding severe hypocapnia (pCO<sub>2</sub> &lt;20 mm Hg) in the first 24 hours of life. (<strong>Strong</strong>) </p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, the GDG suggests avoiding hypercapnia in the first 24 hours of life. (<strong>GCP</strong>)</p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, the GDG recommends avoiding hypoglycaemia in the first 72 hours of life. (<strong>Strong</strong>)</p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, the GDG suggests avoiding hyperglycaemia in the first 72 hours of life. (<strong>GCP</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Treatment</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>In newborns with a gestational age of equal to or greater than 35 weeks with perinatal HIE, does therapeutic hypothermia, in comparison with normothermia, reduce the risk of death or neurological morbidity in the long term? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>The GDG recommends the use of hypothermia in newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with perinatal HIE, both moderate and severe, to reduce the risk of death or severe disability in neurodevelopment at 18 to 24 months of age. (<strong>Strong</strong>) </p>
<p>The GDG recommends the use of hypothermia in newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with perinatal HIE, both moderate and severe, to reduce the risk of death or severe disability in neurodevelopment at 6 to 8 years. (<strong>Weak</strong>) </p>
<p>The GDG recommends that children with moderate or severe HIE be cared for at hospitals with level III neonatal or paediatric intensive care units with the availability of controlled hypothermia and the capacity to respond to the healthcare complexity of these patients, as well as the availability of proven diagnostic-prognostic tests to establish the severity of the brain damage. (<strong>GCP</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with perinatal HIE, does the clinical severity of the encephalopathy determine the effectiveness of treatment with hypothermia?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The GDG recommends the use of hypothermia in newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with perinatal HIE, both moderate and severe, to reduce the risk of death or severe disability in neurodevelopment at 18 to 24 months of age. (<strong>Strong</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks, is the clinical severity of perinatal HIE during the first 6 hours of life correlated to the risk of death or neurological morbidity in the long term?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, the GDG recommends, during the first 6 hours of life, that clinical grading systems based on Sarnat's scale be applied to classify the severity of the encephalopathy and to identify candidates for therapeutic hypothermia (patients with moderate or severe encephalopathy). (<strong>Strong</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, has therapeutic hypothermia changed the capacity of the clinical grading of encephalopathy to predict the risk of death or neurological morbidity in the long term?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, whether or not they are treated with hypothermia, the GDG recommends that the clinical grading of the encephalopathy at 72 hours be used as a tool for predicting the risk of death or severe disability. (<strong>Strong</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Are there pharmacological treatments that, initiated in the first hours of life of newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with moderate or severe perinatal HIE, might decrease neurological morbidity and mortality? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with moderate or severe HIE, the GDG suggests not using allopurinol in the first 6 hours of life to reduce death or disability in the short or medium term. (<strong>GCP</strong>) </p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with moderate or severe HIE, the GDG suggests not using phenobarbital in the first 6 hours of life to reduce death or disability in the short or medium term. (<strong>Weak</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Does the combination of hypothermia with other pharmacological treatments such as topiramate, erythropoietin (EPO), allopurinol or xenon reduce the risk of death or disability at 18 to 24 months in newborns with moderate or severe HIE versus treatment with hypothermia alone in these patients?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with moderate or severe perinatal HIE, the GDG currently suggests not using any pharmacological treatment in conjunction with hypothermia to reduce death or disability. (<strong>GCP</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Does the treatment of electrical seizures in newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, treated or not with therapeutic hypothermia, have an influence on the risk of death or disability at 18 to 24 months?</strong> </p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE and not treated with therapeutic hypothermia and in the presence of electrical seizures, the GDG suggests that anticonvulsant drugs be administered. (<strong>Weak</strong>) </p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with significant HIE treated with therapeutic hypothermia, the GDG suggests that anticonvulsant drugs be administered if there are maintained electrical seizures. (<strong>GCP</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Does sedation with opioid derivatives in newborns with HIE (with or without hypothermia) decrease the risk of death or disability at 18 to 24 months?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>The GDG suggests routine sedation with opioid derivatives, such as morphine or fentanyl, in newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE treated with hypothermia to decrease the stress and discomfort associated with body cooling and to possibly increase the neuroprotective effect of the hypothermia. (<strong>GCP</strong>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prognostic Studies</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>In patients with HIE, treated or not with hypothermia, what is the prognostic value of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG)?</strong> </p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>The GDG suggests the use of aEEG within the first 6 hours of life as a prognostic tool in newborns with HIE. The diagnostic odds ratio (OR) is 30.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]; 10.09 to 93.31) for death/disability in patients not treated with hypothermia and 12.74 (95% CI; 3.24 to 50.16) in patients treated with hypothermia. (<strong>Weak</strong>) </p>
<p>The GDG recommends the use of aEEG as a prognostic tool of death or severe disability in newborns with HIE as from 6 hours of life. This prognostic value in hours of life is delayed in newborn treated with hypothermia versus those not treated with this therapy: the maximum value was obtained at 24 hours in children not treated with hypothermia (97.5% posttest probability for death/disability; 95% CI, 93.3% to 99.1%) and at 48 hours in children treated with hypothermia (96.9% posttest probability; 95% CI, 81.7 to 99.6%). (<strong>Strong</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>In patients with HIE, treated or not with hypothermia, what is the prognostic value of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>The GDG recommends conducting a cerebral MR study during the first month of life as a prognostic tool in newborns with moderate or severe HIE, whether or not they are treated with therapeutic hypothermia (diagnostic OR of 29.5; 95% CI; 12.12 to 72.25%, and diagnostic OR of 29.80; 95% CI; 17.09 to 51.95%, respectively). (<strong>Strong</strong>) </p>
<p>In newborns with HIE, whether or not they are treated with therapeutic hypothermia, the GDG recommends conducting a cerebral MRI at between 8 and 30 days to establish the prognosis of death or severe disability. (<strong>Strong</strong>) </p>
<p>In those patients in which there are prognostic doubts or testing is necessary to orient medical decisions, such as adapting the therapeutic effort, the GDG suggests conducting an early cerebral MRI in the first week of life. The diagnostic OR is 31.05 (95% CI; 10.69 to 90.84) for death/disability in patients not treated with hypothermia and 48.34 (95% CI; 1.85 to 1246.90) in children treated with hypothermia. (<strong>Strong</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>What is the prognostic value of the biomarkers in blood, urine or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) to predict death or neurodevelopmental problems in newborns with moderate or severe HIE, treated or not with hypothermia?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>In newborns with a gestational age of greater than or equal to 35 weeks with HIE, and <span>who</span> are stable and without refractory coagulopathy, the determination of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in CSF in the first 72 hours of life should be considered, particularly if additional information is required to establish the prognosis or make decisions about limiting the therapeutic effort. (<strong>Strong</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-up</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do the current data for predicting neurological damage based on both clinical data and/or the pattern of involvement in the neuroimaging MRI (NMRI) allow establishing differentiated and effective programmes of neurodevelopmental follow-up? </strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>The follow-up on newborns with perinatal HIE and the duration thereof should be planned individually according to both biological risk factors (severity of the encephalopathy, type of brain injury) and family and social factors. (<strong>GCP</strong>) </p>
<p>Children with moderate or severe HIE must be cared for at a hospital centre with access to treatment using hypothermia and to the various prognostic tests indicated in this CPG. (<strong>GCP</strong>) </p>
<p>Assessments should be scheduled considering the age of appearance of each one of the complications and the specific risk that such complications could appear in each child. (<strong>GCP</strong>) </p>
<p>Given the diversity and complexity of the problems that appear after being discharged from the hospital, caring for these children requires a multidisciplinary approach. (<strong>GCP</strong>) </p>
<p>Both children with a high risk of death after being discharged from the hospital and their families require special care targeted at anticipating the complications that lead to death, at optimising care at the end of life and at taking care of family needs related to grief.

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The formulation of clinical questions followed the Patient-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome (PICO) format. </p>
<p>A bibliographical search in: CMA Infobase, DARE (only systematic reviews), National Guideline Clearinghouse, Cochrane, Fisterra, Google, Guidelines International Network, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Tripdatabase, Web of Knowledge Center of Review and Dissemination, Eguidelines, Doc's CISMEf, Gu&iacute;aSalud, NHR Health Technology Assessment Programme, NHS Evidence, Scottish Intercollegiate Network, UK Health Centre, UpToDate, Web Hospital, Web Rafa Bravo, Clinical Trials, Clinical Trials Register, Current Controlled Trials and NHSEED. </p>
<p>Searches were conducted between February 2012 and April 2012, with alerts that were maintained until January 2013. The language was only an excluding factor at the time when the complete text of observational studies written in Chinese, Japanese and Russian were obtained. In the first phase, a preliminary search of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) (used as secondary sources of evidence) and of systematic reviews was conducted in the aforementioned databases. In a second phase, an expanded search of original studies (randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane and CINHAL. The search was expanded to observational studies (third phase) when the clinical question was not answered with the documents identified in the previous phases.

<div class="content_para"><p>Synthesis and evaluation of the quality of the evidence. The two clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy that were found were independently evaluated by two components of the development group using the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation) instrument. Systematic reviews were evaluated using the broken-down criteria of AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews). For the economic evaluations, the criteria described by L&oacute;pez-Bastida et al. were used. The group agreed upon a series of aspects for evaluating the quality of primary studies, which varied depending on whether they were evaluation studies of diagnostic tests or predictive strategies of interventions or of risk factors (see Appendix 2 of the Methodological Material [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p>Final evaluation of the quality of studies and a summary of the evidence for each question, therefore following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).</p>
