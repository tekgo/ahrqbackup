    <li>It is recommended that horticultural therapy be provided for children and adolescents with mental health diagnosis to decrease depression (Gonzalez et al., 2011 [3b]; Gonzalez et al., 2010 [4a]; Cassidy, 1996 [4b]) and increase self-esteem (Local Consensus [5]). </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>This Best Evidence Statement addresses only key points of care for the target population; it is not intended to be a comprehensive practice guideline. These recommendations result from review of literature and practices current at the time of their formulation.

This document is not intended to impose standards of care preventing selective variances from the recommendations to meet the specific and unique requirements of individual patients.

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Applicability Issues</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There are potential safety concerns when engaging in outside activities with children and adolescents in residential treatment. Client's history of high risk behavior and risk of elopement should be assessed prior to participation. </li>
    <li>An important element in this process is properly identifying clients for outside activities by utilizing residential psychiatry resources, such as an On Grounds Activity Planning Decision Tree. </li>
    <li>A formalized procedure should be used to evaluate client's interest, attitude, conflicting behaviors, aggression and mental status, such as an Elopement Risk Assessment. </li>
    <li>Client and staff safety should be considered by providing adequate staffing in accordance to client needs and risk assessment. </li>
    <li>Weather can also be a factor for outside activities. </li>
    <li>Available resources and supplies can also be a barrier for effective horticultural therapy programs, such as inadequate gardening and activity materials and space. Adequate supplies aid in fascination and enhance clients' interest, which may increase their attention to task and eliminate distractive behaviors. </li>
    <li>Horticultural Therapy can be a labor and cost intense program, funding may be an issue. Development and continuation maybe funded by donations and or grant funding. </li>
