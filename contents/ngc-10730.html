Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Process for Initial Literature Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Consistent with the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) published guideline methodology framework, the process started by conducting a comprehensive systematic review. The AUA commissioned an independent group to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature on various therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The protocol of the systematic review was developed <em>a priori</em> by the methodology team in conjunction with the expert panel. The search strategy was developed and executed by reference librarians and methodologists and spanned across multiple databases including Ovid Medline In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus. The evidence report was limited to English-language, peer-reviewed literature published between January 1996 and February 2013. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for the relevant concepts of prostate cancer and castration resistance (biochemical recurrence with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or progression of disease by radiographic criteria despite a castrate testosterone level). An expert panel manually identified additional references to supplement the electronic search, which were required to meet the same criteria as the previously used studies.</p>
<p>The search strategy focused on commonly used as well as experimental therapies including systemic chemotherapy (estramustine, mitoxantrone, docetaxel, cabazitaxel), immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T) and vaccine therapy, agents targeting the androgen signaling pathway (abiraterone, ketoconazole, corticosteroids, antiandrogens), radiotherapy and radiopharmaceuticals (Strontium-89 [Metastron&reg;], Samarium-153 [Quadramet&reg;]), antiandrogen withdrawal, bone targeted therapies (zoledronic acid, denosumab), enzalutamide (androgen receptor inhibitor), palliative care and experimental therapy, (TAK700 [CYP-17 inhibitor], cabozantanib [cMET/VEGFR inhibitor], Radium-223 [Alpharadin&reg;]).</p>
<p>The outcomes of interest were <em>a priori </em>determined by the panel based on their respective importance to patients, recognizing that some of these endpoints are surrogates for the patients and included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), metastasis-free survival, PSA PFS, PSA decline, measurable disease response, adverse events/side-effects of treatment, quality of life (QOL), skeletal-related events (SREs), pain-free survival, and pain response.</p>
<p>The methodology team independently rated the methodological quality of the studies and provided an overall judgment of the whole body of evidence based on confidence in the available estimates of effect.</p>
<p>The methodology team summarized the data with explicit description of study characteristics, methodological quality, main findings and the quality of the evidence (confidence in the estimates). The methodology team attended panel meetings and facilitated incorporation of the evidence into the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Amendment</span></strong></p>
<p>In April 2014 and March 2015, the CRPC guideline was updated through the AUA amendment process in which newly published literature is reviewed and integrated into previously published guidelines in an effort to maintain currency. The amendments allowed for the incorporation of additional literature released since the initial publication of this guideline in 2013. Comprehensive searches of several databases from February 2013 to February 2014 (2014 amendment) and February 2014 to February 2015 (2015 amendment), English language, were conducted. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study's principle investigator. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies on therapy for CRPC.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The methodology team independently rated the methodological quality of the studies and provided an overall judgment of the whole body of evidence based on confidence in the available estimates of effect.</p>
<p>The methodology team summarized the data with explicit description of study characteristics, methodological quality, main findings and the quality of the evidence (confidence in the estimates). The methodology team attended panel meetings and facilitated incorporation of the evidence into the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality of Individual Studies and Determination of Evidence Strength</span></strong></p>
<p>The systematic review included 303 eligible studies that addressed the pre-identified questions of interest. A large body of evidence evaluated established chemotherapy agents such as docetaxel (19 randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), estramustine (5 RCTs) and mitoxantrone (5 RCTs). Randomized evidence was also available for various immunotherapies (8 RCTs), therapies targeting the androgen signaling pathway (12 RCTs), radiotherapy and radiopharmaceuticals (4 RCTs) and bone-targeting therapies (6 RCTs). The quality of these trials was acceptable overall and ranged from moderate to low risk of bias. All the remaining studies were otherwise non-randomized (observational) and considered to be at high risk of bias.</p>
<p>The quality of the evidence (confidence in the estimates) was limited in many studies by indirectness. Indirectness occurs when studies use surrogate endpoints that depend on laboratory or radiographic measurements (prostate specific antigen [PSA] free survival, PSA decline or&nbsp;progression-free survival [PFS], based on imaging). These outcomes usually are surrogates for other important patient outcomes more essential for decision making, such as mortality, pain and quality of life (QOL). Imprecision (wide confidence intervals due to small number of events) was also common in most castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) trials and can lower the confidence in the provided estimates.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations of the Literature</span></strong></p>
<p>The systematic review and guideline process identified clear gaps in the available evidence base. None of the therapies identified in this review were curative or resulted in long term remission. Therefore, primary research on new agents is clearly needed for this important and common condition. Future trials should also use and incorporate patient reported outcomes, such as QOL and pain control. The current evidence base suffers from imprecision that can be overcome by multi-site RCT collaboration or prospective (pre-planned) meta-analyses.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This document was written by the Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Guidelines Panel of the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA), which was created in 2011. The Practice Guidelines Committee (PGC) of the AUA selected the committee chair. Panel members were selected by the chair. Membership of the committee included urologists, and oncologists and other clinicians with specific expertise on this disorder. The mission of the committee was to develop recommendations that are analysis-based or consensus-based, depending on Panel processes and available data, for optimal clinical practices in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). All panel members have specific expertise with regard to the guideline subject to include both urologists and medical oncologists.</p>
<p>To assist in clinical decision-making, six index patients were developed representing the most common clinical scenarios of CRPC that are encountered in clinical practice. These index patients were created based on the presence or absence of metastatic disease, the degree of symptoms, the patients' performance status (as defined by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] scale) and the prior treatment with docetaxel-based chemotherapy.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Asymptomatic non-metastatic CRPC </li>
    <li>Asymptomatic or minimally-symptomatic, metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) without prior docetaxel chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Symptomatic, mCRPC with good performance status and no prior docetaxel chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Symptomatic, mCRPC with poor performance status and no prior docetaxel chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Symptomatic, mCRPC with good performance status and prior docetaxel chemotherapy </li>
    <li>Symptomatic, mCRPC with poor performance status and prior docetaxel chemotherapy </li>
</ol>
<p>Once index patients were developed, the literature was reviewed using the protocol described in the "Methodology" section of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AUA Nomenclature: Linking Statement Type to Evidence Strength</span></strong></p>
<p>The AUA nomenclature system explicitly links statement type to body of evidence strength and the Panel's judgment regarding the balance between benefits and risks/burdens (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>For some clinical issues, there was little or no evidence from which to construct evidence-based statements. Where gaps in the evidence existed, the Panel provides guidance in the form of <em>Clinical Principles</em> or <em>Expert Opinions</em> with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique if differences of opinion existed among Panel members.</p></div>

Once finalized, the Guideline was submitted for approval to the Practice Guidelines Committee (PGC) and the Science &amp; Quality (S&amp;Q) Council. It was then submitted to the AUA Board of Directors for final approval. It was approved by the AUA Board of Directors in April 2015.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Though anti-androgens (flutamide, bicalutamide and nilutamide) are commonly used, these agents can be associated with side effects including gastrointestinal upset and liver toxicity. </li>
    <li>Ketoconazole can be associated with nausea and hepatotoxicity and must be given with replacement steroids. </li>
    <li>Abiraterone is associated with expected increases in mineralocorticoids upstream of cytochrome P (CYP)17A, accounting for the treatment-related side effects, such as hypertension, hypokalemia, edema, and fatigue that respond to low dose glucocorticoids. Use of abiraterone in combination with low-dose prednisone is required to prevent these treatment-related increases in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and attendant side effects. </li>
    <li>Prolonged, continuous therapy with docetaxel (for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC]) can result in cumulative, progressive, non-hematologic toxicity (e.g., neuropathy). </li>
    <li>Possible side effects of radionuclide therapy include bone marrow suppression, anemia, thrombocytopenia. Those patients who have previously received chemotherapy are at greater risk for side effects compared to chemotherapy-naive patients. </li>
    <li>In one study, cabazitaxel resulted in more-clinically-significant diarrhea, but its primary toxicity is hematologic with 82% of patients developing grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 8% developing febrile neutropenia and 5% resulting in death. </li>
    <li>The most common adverse events associated with enzalutamide treatment included fatigue and hypertension. Toxicity from enzalutamide was related primarily to fatigue, diarrhea and hot flashes, although 5 of 800 patients receiving the drug developed seizure activity. </li>
    <li>A not-uncommon side effect of both zoledronic acid and denosumab is hypocalcemia. Denosumab was associated with significant side-effects, including osteonecrosis of the jaw. The toxicity of zoledronic acid includes a small incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw, hypocalcemia and nephrotoxicity. </li>
    <li>Calcium supplementation may not be innocuous, as epidemiologic studies have suggested a relationship between calcium intake and the risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer risk including fatal prostate cancer, though conflicting data exist. </li>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The goal of this guideline is to provide evidence based recommendations for the treatment of castration-resistance prostate cancer (CRPC). Given that this is a rapidly evolving field, this guideline should be used in conjunction with recent systematic literature reviews and an understanding of the individual patient's treatment goals. In all cases, the patient's preferences and personal goals should be considered when choosing therapy. Although the guideline discusses castration-resistant disease, the guideline authors support the standard of care to maintain castrate testosterone levels even in the face of castration-resistant disease. </li>
    <li>While these guidelines do not necessarily establish the standard of care, the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) seeks to recommend and to encourage compliance by practitioners with current best practices related to the condition being treated. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, the guidelines will change. Today these evidence-based guidelines statements represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment under the specific conditions described in each document. For all these reasons, the guidelines do not pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases. </li>
    <li>Treating physicians must take into account variations in resources, and patient tolerances, needs, and preferences. Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome. The guideline text may include information or recommendations about certain drug uses ("off label") that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or about medications or substances not subject to the FDA approval process. The AUA urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances. The physician is encouraged to carefully follow all available prescribing information about indications, contraindications, precautions and warnings. These guidelines and best practice statements are not intended to provide legal advice about use and misuse of these substances. </li>
    <li>Although guidelines are intended to encourage best practices and potentially encompass available technologies with sufficient data as of close of the literature review, they are necessarily time-limited. Guidelines cannot include evaluation of all data on emerging technologies or management, including those that are FDA-approved, which may immediately come to represent accepted clinical practices. For this reason, the AUA does not regard technologies or management which are too new to be addressed by this guideline as necessarily experimental or investigational. </li>
