Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients ages 50 to 75 years who have one or more of the following screenings:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Colonoscopy in past 10 years </li>
    <li>Flexible sigmoidoscopy in past five years </li>
    <li>Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) annually</li>
</ul></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of patients up-to-date with Level I preventive services.</p>
<p><strong>Level I Services</strong>: Preventive services for which clinicians and health systems <em>must</em> assess the need. These services <em>must</em> be recommended to each patient, as they have the highest value and are worthy of attention at every opportunity.</p>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations are fully endorsed by the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) Preventive Services work group:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>"Screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy in adults beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. The risks and benefits of these screening methods vary." </li>
    <li>"Against routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults ages 76 to 85 years. There may be considerations that support colorectal cancer screening in an individual patient." </li>
    <li>"Against screening for colorectal cancer in adults older than age 85 years." </li>
    <li>"The evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of computed tomographic colonography and fecal DNA testing as screening modalities for colorectal cancer." </li>
</ol>
<p>(USPSTF, 2008)</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) has long had a policy of transparency in declaring potential conflicting and competing interests of all individuals who participate in the development, revision and approval of ICSI guidelines and protocols. </p>
<p>In 2010, the ICSI Conflict of Interest Review Committee was established by the Board of Directors to review all disclosures and make recommendations to the board when steps should be taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, including recommendations regarding removal of work group members. This committee has adopted the Institute of Medicine Conflict of Interest standards as outlined in the report Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2011). </p>
<p>Where there are work group members with identified potential conflicts, these are disclosed and discussed at the initial work group meeting. These members are expected to recuse themselves from related discussions or authorship of related recommendations, as directed by the Conflict of Interest committee or requested by the work group.</p>
