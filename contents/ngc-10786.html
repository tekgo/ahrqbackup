Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The evidence search and review included electronic database searches in <em>The Cochrane Library</em>, Medline via Ovid, and CINAHL via EBSCO. The search strategy is shown in the Appendix in the original guideline document. Related article searches were conducted in PubMed. The bibliographies of articles identified by database searches were also reviewed by 1 of 4 members of the committee, and references identified in this manner were added to the review. Articles included in the 2003 evidence report on bronchiolitis in preparation of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2006 guideline also were reviewed. In addition, the committee reviewed articles published after completion of the systematic review for these updated guidelines. The current literature review encompasses the period from 2004 through May 2014.</p>
<p>Other criteria helped define the setting, age, language, and date of publication. Both outpatient (clinicians' offices, outpatient clinics, emergency departments) and inpatient (hospitals) were included. Studies were limited to pediatrics. Searches were also limited to English language, although studies in other languages were reviewed when included in relevant systematic reviews. Date parameters were not restricted; however, newer studies were focused for antimicrobial therapy and cost effectiveness studies. In addition to the electronic searches, articles were received from subcommittee members, and reference lists were also searched. The same criteria were applied to these articles as to those in the initial search.</p>
<p>Study design criteria for full text review varied by section of the technical report. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews were reviewed for original studies not found in the initial electronic searches. For diagnostic studies, controlled clinical trials and observational studies (both prospective and large retrospective) studies were reviewed. For therapy studies, randomized controlled trials were reviewed as well as large prospective and retrospective observational studies. For prevention and long term effect studies, prospective observational and other epidemiologic studies were reviewed.</p></div>

Number of Source Documents

<div class="content_para"><p>From the initial electronic search, 2,887 articles were found related to infants and children diagnosed with bronchiolitis and its management. After removing duplicate citations and title and abstract review for relevance, patient population, and study design, full text review of 418 articles also included appraisal of validity. Committee members submitted an additional 46 articles. Seventeen articles were found through searching reference lists. Of these articles, 146 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the technical report.</p></div>

<p>Titles and abstracts were reviewed by a methodologist for potential inclusion. Titles and abstracts not relevant to the clinical topic areas designated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Bronchiolitis Management Guideline Committee were excluded. Full texts of articles related to the respective sections of the guideline were distributed to committee members for review. The methodologist also reviewed all full text articles for the technical report, critically appraising individual articles using the Let Evidence Guide Every New Decision (LEGEND) evidence evaluation system. Evidence quality appraisal for the body of evidence related to recommendation statements followed the AAP's levels for aggregate evidence quality, allowing for integration of evidence into the recommendation development process by committee members. Narrative evidence synthesis was conducted and data was extracted by the methodologist. Evidence tables were constructed to summarize the studies, when relevant.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>In June 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a new subcommittee to review and revise the 2006 bronchiolitis guideline. The subcommittee included primary care physicians, including general pediatricians, a family physician, and pediatric subspecialists, including hospitalists, pulmonologists, emergency physicians, a neonatologist, and pediatric infectious disease physicians. The subcommittee also included an epidemiologist trained in systematic reviews, a guideline methodologist/informatician, and a parent representative.</p>
<p>The evidence-based approach to guideline development requires that the evidence in support of a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and recommendations be defined. Evidence-based recommendations reflect the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the recommendation is followed. The AAP policy statement "Classifying Recommendations for Clinical Practice" was followed in designating levels of recommendation (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p></div>
