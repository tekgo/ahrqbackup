Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older admitted to hospital with an injury diagnosis from a blunt force mechanism and documented assessment of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine and decision to continue or discontinue spine immobilization within 36 hours of admission to hospital (per 100 patients).</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Each year, injuries affect 700 million people worldwide and result in more than five million deaths. In many countries, injuries are the leading cause of death among those under the age of 45 years. The human and societal burden is even greater with many survivors never returning to school, work or their "regular" lives. </p>
<p>Health care services provide patients with treatment for what is a major cause of morbidity and death. Yet medical errors and substandard care threaten trauma care. Half of all patients with major traumatic injuries do not receive recommended care, medical errors are common in critically ill trauma patients and preventable trauma deaths in hospital are widely reported. The World Health Organization (WHO), professional trauma organizations (e.g., American College of Surgeons [ACS], Trauma Association of Canada and Royal Australasian College of Surgeons) and accreditation bodies have promoted efforts to improve the quality of care delivered to injured patients. However, before the quality of injury care can be improved, it needs to be measured using reliable and valid measures of health care quality.</p>
<p>These indicators can be used to assess patient safety, and to evaluate and improve quality of care by incorporating these measures into local, regional or national quality improvement efforts. Implementing a consistent approach to measurement (same indicators, same definitions, same data elements, same reporting format) would provide institutions with reliable performance data that is necessary for surveillance (e.g., tertiary survey completion), to track local problems (e.g., adverse events &ndash; specifically missed injuries), evaluate the effects of interventions or program changes (e.g., tertiary survey protocol) and provide comparisons across centers (e.g., benchmarking adverse events using programs such as the ACS's Trauma Quality Improvement Program). Well-designed, carefully evaluated and appropriately implemented quality indicators (QIs) may be essential tools for guiding efforts to improve health and healthcare.</p>
<p>This indicator is intended to monitor whether spine evaluation and decision making regarding immobilization is performed in a timely fashion.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Two studies demonstrated that the implementation of a trauma quality improvement program that included the quality indicator was associated with reduced hospital mortality (Chadbunchachai et al., 2001; Chadbunchachai et al., 2003). The majority of the studies recommended that clearance be performed within 72 hours of admission to minimize immobilization associated complications (Albrecht et al., 2001; "Cervical spine," 2009), although mortality wasn't reduced with earlier clearance (Griffen et al., 2003; Schinkel et al., 2006). Some studies recommended the use of helical CT scan to evaluate of the cervical spine (Barba et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2005). </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Using a modification of the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Methodology, a panel of 19 injury and quality of care experts serially rated and revised quality indicators identified from a systematic review of the literature and international audit of trauma center quality improvement practices. The quality indicators developed by the panel were sent to 133 verified trauma centers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for evaluation.</p>
<p>A total of 84 quality indicators were rated and revised by the expert panel over 4 rounds of review producing 31 quality indicators of structure (n=5), process (n=21), and outcome (n=5), designed to assess the safety (n=8), effectiveness (n=17), efficiency (n=6), timeliness (n=16), equity (n=2), and patient-centeredness (n=1) of injury care spanning prehospital (n=8), hospital (n=19), and posthospital (n=2) care and secondary injury prevention (n=1). A total of 101 trauma centers (76% response rate) rated the indicators (1=strong disagreement, 9=strong agreement) as targeting important health improvements (median score 9, interquartile range [IQR] 8 to 9), easy to interpret (median score 8, IQR 8 to 9), easy to implement (median score 8, IQR 7 to 8), and globally good indicators (median score 8, IQR 8 to 9).</p>
<p>Thirty-one evidence-informed quality indicators of adult injury care were developed, shown to have content validity, and can be used as performance measures to guide injury care quality improvement practices.</p>
<p>Trauma centers rated the indicator "percentage of patients age 18 years and older admitted to hospital with an injury diagnosis from a blunt force mechanism and documented assessment of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine and decision to continue or discontinue spine immobilization within 36 hours of admission to hospital" as targeting important health improvements (median score 9, IQR 7 to 9), easy to interpret (median score 8, IQR 7 to 9), easy to implement (median score 8, IQR 6 to 9), and globally a good indicator (median score 8, IQR 7 to 9).</p></div>
