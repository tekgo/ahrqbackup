Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the classification of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>1-3</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>Please see the full-text version of this guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for the target population of each recommendation listed below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Radiosurgery vs Observation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>What are the indications for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment vs observation for patients with intracanalicular vestibular schwannomas without evidence of radiographic progression?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: If tinnitus is not observed at presentation, it is recommended that intracanalicular vestibular schwannomas and small tumors (&lt;2 cm) without tinnitus be observed as observation does not have a negative impact on tumor growth or hearing preservation compared to treatment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Radiosurgery Technology</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there a difference in outcome based on radiosurgery equipment used: Gamma Knife (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) vs linear accelerator-based radiosurgery vs proton beam?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There are no studies that compare 2 or all 3 modalities. Thus, recommendations on outcome based on modality cannot be made.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Radiosurgery Technique</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there a difference in outcome based on the dose delivered?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: As there is no difference in radiographic control using different doses, it is recommended that for single fraction SRS doses, &lt;13 Gy be used to facilitate hearing preservation and minimize new onset or worsening of preexisting cranial nerve deficits.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Is there a difference in outcome based on the number of fractions?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>As there is no difference in radiographic control and clinical outcome using single or multiple fractions, no recommendations can be given.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Radiographic Follow-Up, Retreatment, and Tumorigenesis after Radiosurgery</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the best time sequence for follow-up images after SRS?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Follow-up imaging should be obtained at intervals after SRS based on clinical indications, a patient's personal circumstances, or institutional protocols. Long-term follow-up with serial magnetic resonance images to evaluate for recurrence is recommended. No recommendations can be given regarding the interval of these studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there a role for retreatment?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: When there has been progression of tumor after SRS, SRS can be safely and effectively performed as a retreatment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>What is the risk of radiation-induced malignant transformation of vestibular schwannomas treated with SRS?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Patients should be informed that there is minimal risk of malignant transformation of vestibular schwannomas after SRS.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neurofibromatosis Type 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>What are the indications for SRS in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Radiosurgery is a treatment option for patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 whose vestibular schwannomas are enlarging and/or causing hearing loss.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Method</span></strong></p>
<p>A broad search strategy was used because of the relatively small number of studies on each specific topic. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched according to the strategy summarized in Table 1 in the full guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The searches of electronic databases were supplemented with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles were also searched for potentially relevant citations. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed below. As noted above, the guideline committee also examined lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions. The task force went to great lengths to obtain a complete set of relevant articles. Having a complete set ensures that the guideline is not based on a biased subset of articles.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Eligibility Criteria for Literature</span></strong></p>
<p>General eligibility criteria were then applied with the resultant narrowing of the abstract publications as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Deduplication of references </li>
    <li>Limiting to human references </li>
    <li>Limiting to English references </li>
    <li>Limiting to January 1, 1946 to December 31, 2014 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Abstracts for the initial 956 references were then reviewed and selected based on them meeting the following predetermined criteria:</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having vestibular schwannomas (VSs) </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Was not an in vitro study </li>
    <li>Was not a biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Was published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014 </li>
    <li>Was published in a peer-reviewed journal </li>
    <li>Was not a meeting abstract, editorial, letter, or commentary </li>
    <li>Was published in English </li>
    <li>Was not a review article </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Outcomes that included adult patients with VSs,<br />
    AND </li>
    <li>Outcomes following radiation therapy reported in &ge;5 patients </li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 1 in the full guideline (PRISMA diagram) summarizes the flow after the literature search.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014. Two electronic databases, PubMed and the Cochrane Library, were searched. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline task force members and the medical librarian using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies (see Table 1 and Figure 1 in the full guideline).</p></div>

<p>Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections. Reasons for exclusion for papers were also documented to be able to discuss pertinent problem citations in the scientific foundation as needed.</p>
<p>Studies that met the eligibility criteria were subject to more detailed scrutiny and had their data extracted by 1 reviewer and the extracted information was checked by 1 or more other reviewers. Evidence and summary tables, reporting the extracted study information and evidence classification, were generated for all the included studies for each of the questions. Evidence tables were created with the most recent data first and subsequent listings in retrograde chronological order. The table headings consisted of first author name and year, followed by a brief study description, chosen data class, and conclusion. The authors were directed to craft the data in the tables in a succinct and fact-filled manner to allow for rapid understanding of the literature entry by the readership. The literature in the evidence tables was expanded upon in the Results section of each guideline article to emphasize important points supporting its classification and contribution to recommendations. The method by which this was accomplished is expanded upon in the Joint Guideline Committee (JGC) Guideline Development Methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Internal drafts of the tables and manuscripts were developed by sharing them between writers electronically, by telephone, and in face-to-face meetings. Summary and conclusion statements were included for each section, with comments on key issues for future investigation being added where pertinent.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writing Group and Questions Establishment</span></strong></p>
<p>After establishing vestibular schwannoma (VS) management as a priority for guideline development, the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the Guidelines Committee of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons selected a multidisciplinary group of individuals to carry out this project. The entire group of individuals were screened for conflict of interest and then assembled into smaller groups by general components of management. These groups then agreed upon the main questions pertinent to these management components and shared them with the overall group for modification. The task force was divided into groups by management topic and proceeded with writing of the guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification of Evidence and Guideline Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The concept of linking evidence to recommendations has been further formalized by the American Medical Association (AMA) and many specialty societies, including AANS, CNS, and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). This formalization involves the designation of specific relationships between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations to avoid ambiguity. In the paradigm for therapeutic maneuvers, evidence is classified according to the scheme in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields). A basis for these guidelines can be viewed in the Joint Guidelines Committee methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables, and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The Vestibular Schwannoma Guidelines Task Force members were required to report all possible conflicts of interest (COIs) prior to beginning work on the guideline, using the COI disclosure form of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Guidelines Committee, including potential COIs that are unrelated to the topic of the guideline. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair reviewed the disclosures and either approved or disapproved the nomination. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair are given latitude to approve nominations of Task Force members with possible conflicts and address this by restricting the writing and reviewing privileges of that person to topics unrelated to the possible COIs. The conflict of interest findings are provided in detail in the full-text introduction and methods manuscript (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>
