Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for quality of evidence (<strong>High, Moderate, Low</strong>) and strength of recommendation (<strong>Strong, Conditional</strong>) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary and Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Only stools from patients with diarrhea should be tested for<em> Clostridium difficile</em>. <strong>(Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for <em>C. difficile</em> toxin genes such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are superior to toxins A+B enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing as a standard diagnostic test for <em>C. difficile</em> infection (CDI). <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) screening tests for <em>C. difficile</em> can be used in two- or three-step screening algorithms with subsequent toxin A and B EIA testing, but the sensitivity of such strategies is lower than NAATs. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Repeat testing should be discouraged.<strong> (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Testing for cure should not be done. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Management of Mild, Moderate, and Severe CDI</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li>If a patient has strong a pre-test suspicion for CDI, empiric therapy for CDI should be considered regardless of the laboratory testing result, as the negative predictive values for CDI are insufficiently high to exclude disease in these patients. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Any inciting antimicrobial agent(s) should be discontinued, if possible. <strong>(Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Patients with mild-to-moderate CDI should be treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally three times per day for 10 days. <strong>(Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Patients with severe CDI should be treated with vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days <strong>(Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Failure to respond to metronidazole therapy within 5&ndash;7 days should prompt consideration of a change in therapy to vancomycin at standard dosing. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>For mild-to-moderate CDI in patients who are intolerant/allergic to metronidazole and for pregnant/breastfeeding women, vancomycin should be used at standard dosing. <strong>(Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>In patients in whom oral antibiotics cannot reach a segment of the colon, such as with Hartman's pouch, ileostomy, or colon diversion, vancomycin therapy delivered via enema should be added to treatments above until the patient improves. <strong>(Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>The use of anti-peristaltic agents to control diarrhea from confirmed or suspected CDI should be limited or avoided, as they may obscure symptoms and precipitate complicated disease. Use of anti-peristaltic agents in the setting of CDI must always be accompanied by medical therapy for CDI. <strong>(Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Management of Severe and Complicated CDI</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="14">
    <li>Supportive care should be delivered to all patients and includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, electrolyte replacement, and pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Furthermore, in the absence of ileus or significant abdominal distention, oral or enteral feeding should be continued. <strong>(Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen and pelvis is recommended in patients with complicated CDI. <strong>(Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Vancomycin delivered orally (125 mg four times per day) plus intravenous metronidazole (500 mg three times a day) is the treatment of choice in patients with severe and complicated CDI who have no significant abdominal distention. <strong>(Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Vancomycin delivered orally (500 mg four times per day) and per rectum (500 mg in a volume of 500 ml four times a day) plus intravenous metronidazole (500 mg three times a day) is the treatment of choice for patients with complicated CDI with ileus or toxic colon and/or significant abdominal distention. <strong>(Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Surgical consult should be obtained in all patients with complicated CDI. Surgical therapy should be considered in patients with any one of the following attributed to CDI: hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy; clinical signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction (renal and pulmonary); mental status changes; white blood cell count &ge;50,000 cells/&mu;l, lactate &ge;5 mmol/l; or failure to improve on medical therapy after 5 days. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Management of Recurrent CDI (RCDI)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="19">
    <li>The first recurrence of CDI can be treated with the same regimen that was used for the initial episode. If severe, however vancomycin should be used. The second recurrence should be treated with a pulsed vancomycin regimen. <strong>(Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>If there is a third recurrence after a pulsed vancomycin regimen, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) should be considered. <strong>(Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>There is limited evidence for the use of adjunct probiotics to decrease recurrences in patients with RCDI. <strong>(Moderate recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>No effective immunotherapy is currently available. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) does not have a role as sole therapy in treatment of RCDI. However, it may be helpful in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. <strong>(Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Management of Patients with CDI and Co-morbid Conditions</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="23">
    <li>All patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) hospitalized with a disease flare should undergo testing for CDI. <strong>(Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Ambulatory patients with IBD who develop diarrhea in the setting of previously quiescent disease, or in the presence of risk factors such as recent hospitalization, or antibiotic use, should be tested for CDI. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>In patients who have IBD with severe colitis, simultaneous initiation of empiric therapy directed against CDI and treatment of an IBD flare may be required while awaiting results of <em>C. difficile</em> testing. <strong>(Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>In patients with IBD, ongoing immunosuppression medications can be maintained in patients with CDI. Escalation of immunosuppression medications should be avoided in the setting of untreated CDI. <strong>(Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Patients with IBD who have a surgically created pouch after colectomy may develop CDI and should be tested if they have symptoms. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Underlying immunosuppression (including malignancy, chemotherapy, corticosteroid therapy, organ transplantation, and cirrhosis) increases the risk of CDI, and such patients should be tested if they have a diarrheal illness. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Any diarrheal illness in women who are pregnant or periparturient should prompt testing for <em>C. difficile</em>. <strong>(Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Infection Control and Prevention</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="30">
    <li>A hospital-based infection control programs can help to decrease the incidence of CDI. <strong>(Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Routine screening for <em>C. difficile</em> in hospitalized patients without diarrhea is not recommended and asymptomatic carriers should not be treated. <strong>(Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Antibiotic stewardship is recommended to reduce the risk of CDI. <strong>(Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Contact precautions for a patient with CDI should be maintained at a minimum until the resolution of diarrhea. <strong>(Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Patients with known or suspected CDI should be placed in a private room or in a room with another patient with documented CDI. <strong>(Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Hand hygiene and barrier precautions, including gloves and gowns, should be used by all health-care workers and visitors entering the room of any patient with known or suspected CDI. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Single-use disposable equipment should be used for prevention of CDI transmission. Non-disposable medical equipment should be dedicated to the patient's room and other equipment should be thoroughly cleaned after use in a patient with CDI. <strong>(Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Disinfection of environmental surfaces is recommended using an Environmental Protective Agency (EPA)-registered disinfectant with <em>C. difficile</em>-sporicidal label claim or 5000 p.p.m. chlorine-containing cleaning agents in areas of potential contamination by <em>C. difficile</em>. <strong>(Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence)</strong> </li>
    <li>Although there is moderate evidence that two probiotics (<em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> GG and <em>Saccharomyces boulardii</em>) decrease the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhea, there is insufficient evidence that probiotics prevent <em>C. difficile</em> infection. <strong>(Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)</strong></li>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate diagnosis, treatment and prevention of <em>Clostridium difficile</em>. </li>
    <li>It has become evident that surgery is of benefit to patients at the advanced extreme of <em>C. difficile</em> infection (CDI), and early surgical consultation has been associated with improved survival. </li>
    <li>Several published case reports suggest open-label benefit of intravenously administered tigecycline as a rescue strategy for the treatment of patients with severe CDI, in whom therapy with vancomycin and metronidazole has failed. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/Society of Hospital Epidemiologists of America (SHEA) guidelines included a C-III recommendation to "avoid [the] use of antiperistaltic agents, as they may obscure symptoms and precipitate toxic megacolon." A literature review of 55 patients with <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection (CDI) who were exposed to such agents found that 17 patients developed colonic dilatation and 5 died. All of these adverse outcomes, however, occurred in patients with CDI who initially received treatment with antiperistaltic agents alone. All 23 patients in this review who received antiperistaltic agents only in combination with CDI antimicrobial therapy survived. </li>
    <li>Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) appears to be safe, with no adverse effects or complications directly attributed to the procedure yet described in the existing literature. The potential for transmission of infectious agents is a concern, however, and a recent publication outlines rigorous screening of stool donors' blood and stool for common bacterial and viral enteropathogens. In July 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a policy on FMT (see the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-07-18/pdf/2013-17223.pdf" title="GPO Web site" target="_blank">Federal Register</a> for details). </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>Metronidazole treatment should be avoided in pregnancy and breastfeeding. First trimester exposure to metronidazole is not recommended in U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines because of concern regarding ready placental transmission and case reports describing facial anomalies following exposure.
