<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Summary of Literature Review</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Due to the high prevalence of benign focal hepatic lesions in adults, liver lesion characterization is an important objective of diagnostic imaging. Incidental liver masses are often discovered in healthy adults during routine imaging procedures as well as during staging of a known malignancy, and they need to be characterized.</p>
<p>Common benign liver masses include cysts, biliary hamartomas, and hemangiomas; common malignant tumors include metastases and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Less common liver tumors include focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), hepatocellular adenoma, fibrolamellar HCC, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, biliary cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma, lymphoma, stromal tumors, a variety of sarcomas, hemangioendothelioma, and hepatoblastoma, the latter occurring in children. On occasion, nontumorous masses may mimic liver tumors. These mimics include focal fat deposition or sparing, abscess, hematoma, vascular shunts such as the ones to treat portal venous-hepatic venous malformations, peliosis hepatis and transient hepatic attenuation differences on computed tomography (CT), or transient hepatic intensity differences on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with cirrhosis are a special group in whom certain benign (regenerating nodules), premalignant (dysplastic nodules), malignant (HCC), and nontumorous (confluent hepatic fibrosis) masses are more prevalent.</p>
<p>For each of the variants in this document, it is assumed that some prior imaging study has been performed and identified a lesion that may or may not be characterized by the initial imaging evaluation,&nbsp;or it is assumed that the initial technique was suboptimal from a technical standpoint. Prior imaging studies may include ultrasonography (US) with color-flow evaluation, noncontrast and/or contrast-enhanced multidetector helical CT, or noncontrast and/or contrast-enhanced MRI.</p>
<p>This topic has been addressed somewhat differently in the White Paper of the American College of Radiology (ACR) Incidental Findings Committee. That document attempted to address what to do with an incidental liver lesion detected on CT only. Masses were divided into 3 size categories (&lt;0.5 cm, 0.5 cm&ndash;1.5 cm, and &gt;1.5 cm) and then stratified based on size, risk factors, and/or CT imaging characteristics into benign or suspicious. This American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria&reg; (AC) document addresses if and how to characterize a hepatic mass detected with any modality.</p>
<p>For purposes of increased clarity, in this AC, the panel members combined the low-risk and average-risk individuals into one category using the definitions as stated in the White Paper (any age with no known malignancies, hepatic dysfunction, hepatic cancer risk factors, or symptoms attributable to the liver). The definition of a high-risk individual in this AC differs from the White Paper in that the guideline authors separate those individuals with pre-existing liver disease (cirrhosis, hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis, and hepatic dysfunction) from those with a known primary malignancy. Lastly, the guideline authors use a size cutoff &le;1 cm as there are no data to support a different approach for patients with lesions &lt;5 mm and 5 to 10 mm. In this revision, the authors added 3 more clinical variants for indeterminate masses &lt;1 cm in size: &lt;1 cm lesion, low-risk, and average-risk individual; &lt;1 cm, high-risk individual, suspected metastatic disease, known extrahepatic malignancy (EHM); &lt;1 cm, high-risk individual with underlying liver disease.</p>
<p><strong>Variant Development</strong></p>
<p>"Liver lesion characterization" is undertaken for hepatic masses seen by US, CT, or MRI. For the variant analysis, one can consider the following combination of: I) lesion characteristics and II) clinical risk factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lesion characteristics (size and appearance)</span>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><em>Larger than 1 cm</em>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><em>Typical benign</em>: Liver lesion where the US, CT, or MRI appearance is diagnostic or highly suggestive of a benign mass (cyst, hemangioma, focal fat, or FNH). This may occur in a patient with or without a known history of malignancy. </li>
            <li><em>Typical malignant</em>: Liver lesion with a US, CT, or MRI appearance that is highly suggestive of a malignant mass (HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, or metastases) in a patient who may or may not have a known malignancy. </li>
            <li><em>Indeterminate (variants 1-3)</em>: Liver lesion with a US, CT, or MRI appearance that is indeterminate. This may occur in a patient with a background of normal liver, chronic liver disease, or known extrahepatic primary malignancy. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><em>Smaller than 1 cm indeterminate</em>: Liver lesions &lt;1 cm with a US, CT, or MRI appearance is indeterminate, regardless of clinical history. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;" start="2">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical risk factors</span>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>History of extrahepatic malignancy (EHM) </li>
        <li>Underlying history of liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatitis B or C, primary sclerosing cholangitis, steatohepatitis) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Tests</strong></p>
<p>To characterize a liver lesion discovered by US, CT, or MRI, the following diagnostic studies may be considered:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (multidetector helical) </li>
    <li>MRI (including contrast enhancement with gadolinium chelates) </li>
    <li>Sonography: Routine gray scale and Doppler US </li>
    <li>CT/positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) </li>
    <li>Nuclear scintigraphy (technetium-99 metastable [Tc-99m] sulfur colloid or Tc-99m red blood cell [RBC], OctreoScan) </li>
    <li>Percutaneous image-guided biopsy </li>
</ul>
<p>When considering possible studies for liver lesion characterization, it is assumed that a logical sequence will be followed. For example, if MRI and biopsy are considered appropriate tests, it is assumed that the biopsy will be done if the MRI is nondiagnostic. In this case, both studies should be considered "indicated."</p>
<p><strong>Special Considerations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Lesions previously characterized as benign</em>: For a lesion previously characterized as benign, follow-up imaging is not usually indicated unless the patient has new symptoms or a change in the size, attenuation, signal intensity, or degree/pattern of enhancement of a benign lesion, which is a cause for concern. </li>
    <li><em>Indeterminate lesions</em>: For indeterminate liver lesions &gt;1 cm in all other categories described above, a biopsy should be considered when the findings from the additional imaging tests are inconclusive. Alternatively, in certain clinical situations, short-term imaging surveillance (3 to 4 months) can be useful to monitor lesion stability. Depending on the stability of the lesion or the underlying disease process, interval scans may be extended over longer periods (e.g., 6 to 12 months) and repeated as necessary, especially in the setting of underlying liver disease. </li>
    <li><em>Subcentimeter lesion</em>: These lesions are difficult to characterize, although MRI may be helpful. In patients with extrahepatic primary malignancy, these small lesions are often evaluated with follow-up imaging since most are benign. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contrast Agents</strong></p>
<p><em>Ultrasound Contrast Agents</em></p>
<p>Research performed outside the United States on second-generation US contrast agents has demonstrated high accuracy in characterizing liver lesions. These agents consist of either stable perfluorocarbon nanoparticles or sulfur hexafluoride microbubbles; they are injected intravenously and insonated with low acoustic pressure. The nanoparticles emit a harmonic signal and can be detected with pulse inversion recovery to demonstrate the vascular architecture of a lesion, as well as the temporal course of enhancement, thereby allowing characterization of the lesion. These agents have not been approved for hepatic imaging in the United States.</p>
<p><em>MRI Contrast Agents</em></p>
<p>MRI contrast agents, such as mangafodipir and ferumoxides may be of value for distinguishing between benign and malignant primary hepatocellular tumors and for detecting metastatic disease. However, experience with the use of these agents is mainly limited to phase III clinical trials, and these agents are not widely available for clinical use. At this time, mangafodipir is not available for clinical use in the United States.</p>
<p>Gadobenate dimeglumine can be used to differentiate FNH from other lesions such as hepatocellular adenoma. Approximately 5% of this agent is metabolized by the liver, accumulating in the biliary ductule cells present in FNH and resulting in mild persistent enhancement on delayed imaging at 1 to 3 hours after contrast administration. Newer liver-specific agents such as gadoxetic acid have approximately 50% hepatic uptake and metabolism, accumulating in healthy liver cells and resulting in persistent enhancement of the background liver and no enhancement of lesions that do not contain functioning hepatocytes. With this agent, there is mild to vivid enhancement of FNH on delayed imaging at 10 to 20 minutes after contrast administration. FNH is not known to occur in the cirrhotic liver. Therefore, delayed uptake in such cases should not favor a benign process since well-differentiated HCC may have functioning hepatocytes. These newer agents enable a delayed hepatobiliary phase in addition to hepatic arterial, portal venous, and equilibrium phase MR imaging for lesion detection and characterization and detection.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> (see also Appendices 1 and 2 in the original guideline document)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Typical benign mass: no history of malignancy</em>. Liver masses with typical imaging features of simple cyst, hemangioma, hepatic adenoma, or FNH in patients who are not known to have, or are not suspected of having, a malignancy may be classified as benign. Focal fat deposition or focal sparing in a liver with otherwise diffuse fat deposition can generally be diagnosed when typical features are seen on sonography, noncontrast CT, and, most reliably, MRI using chemical shift (in phase and out of phase) imaging. These typical benign lesions do not require further follow-up if they have been characterized as a benign process. </li>
    <li><em>Typical benign mass: known history of malignancy</em>. Liver masses with typical imaging features of simple cyst, hemangioma, or FNH in patients who are known to have a malignancy may be considered benign and do not require follow-up. However, if there is any doubt that the mass is benign, tumor markers, short-interval follow-up, imaging or biopsy should be considered. </li>
    <li><em>Typical malignant mass</em>: Lesions with typical imaging features of a malignant mass do not require additional imaging, but confirmation with serum tumor markers (e.g., alpha fetoprotein in the case of HCC) or percutaneous biopsy image-guided may be appropriate. In some cases, additional imaging such as nuclear scintigraphy (somatostatin receptor) or PET/CT can be performed to fully stage the extent of disease prior to an invasive biopsy, particularly if there is a history of primary EHM. </li>
    <li><em>Indeterminate mass &gt;1 cm: low-risk or average-risk individual (variant 1)</em>. For indeterminate masses on background of normal liver, additional imaging may be required for tissue characterization.
    <p>If the initial indeterminate imaging test is US or CT, then MRI should be considered for liver lesion characterization. MRI would be particularly preferred in pediatric and young adult patients due to its lack of ionizing radiation. Nuclear scintigraphy is an option in patients with suspected FNH (using technetium-labeled sulfur colloid). US can have a role in cases of T2 hyperintense lesions found on MRI and hypodense lesions found on CT to determine whether they are solid or cystic or to confirm a hemangioma.</p>
    </li>
    <li><em>Indeterminate mass &gt;1 cm: high-risk individual, suspect metastatic disease, known EHM (variant 2)</em>. In these patients, interval follow-up imaging is usually not a practical option due to the need to initiate appropriate treatment. Dynamic contrast-enhanced, multiphase, multidetector CT, multiphase MRI (with a gadolinium chelate), or contrast-enhanced US (only available outside the United States) may be used to characterize a lesion further and identify additional lesions in the setting of metastatic disease. Percutaneous image-guided liver biopsy should always be considered and will enable tissue diagnosis.
    <p>If the underlying extrahepatic primary malignancy is FDG avid (e.g., melanoma, colon and esophageal cancer, breast cancer, sarcoma) and the diagnosis of liver metastasis will influence patient management, PET/CT imaging may be useful. Note, however, that metastases from mucin-producing colorectal carcinoma may not be FDG avid. Furthermore, HCC may not be FDG avid. Nuclear scintigraphy is also an option for further staging in patients with an underlying primary neuroendocrine malignancy (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy).</p>
    </li>
    <li><em>Indeterminate mass &gt;1 cm: high-risk individual with underlying liver disease (variant 3)</em>. Characterization of liver lesions in a cirrhotic liver may be performed with either multiphase MRI (with a gadolinium-chelate) or dynamic contrast-enhanced multiphase, multidetector CT. Characterization is more definitive for lesions &gt;2 cm in diameter. MRI may be useful to characterize indeterminate masses identified on CT or US. If the mass remains indeterminate after MRI, then percutaneous image-guided biopsy may be needed to make a final diagnosis. Percutaneous biopsy may not be indicated in patients who are liver transplant candidates due to the risk of needle-tract seeding. In such cases, short-term follow-up imaging in 3 to 6 months may be obtained. Digital subtraction angiography may also be obtained in these patients, and if a tumor stain is detected, chemoembolization is performed as a bridge to transplantation. </li>
    <li><em>Subcentimeter lesion</em>. Subcentimeter lesions can be benign or malignant, although the majority are benign, even in a patient with a known EHM. Benign lesions are usually a result of hepatobiliary fibrocystic continuum such as biliary hamartomas, microhamartomas, and simple cysts. Small hepatic cysts can also be seen in patients who have experienced a prior insult such as a biopsy of or trauma to the liver. These subcentimeter lesions are nonspecific on US and CT partly due to their small size and volume averaging. MRI may help confirm their cystic nature and benignity, especially in a patient with underlying malignancy or chronic liver disease. When a subcentimeter lesion is poorly detected or indeterminate on MRI and there is either underlying liver disease or EHM, where there is greater risk of a malignant lesion, initial short-term surveillance (3 months) can be useful to monitor lesion stability. Depending on the stability of the lesion or underlying disease process, interval scans can be extended over longer periods, e.g., 6 months to 1 year. In the case of extrahepatic malignancy, contrast-enhanced CT is most efficacious for whole-body staging unless the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) precludes an enhanced examination. For patients with underlying liver disease, MRI may be more helpful for further characterization, specifically in delineating regenerative, siderotic, or dysplastic nodule as well as HCC. </li>
    <li>Three additional variants have been created to deal with small indeterminate lesions:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><em>Indeterminate &lt;1 cm mass in a low-risk or average-risk individual (variant 4)</em>: In almost all low-risk or average-risk individuals, an indeterminate &lt;1 cm liver lesion is benign. If indeterminate on US or CT, MRI may characterize the lesion. However, unless there is patient anxiety, one could argue that no further characterization of these lesions is indicated. The best course may be to perform no further imaging. If patient anxiety is high, a follow-up in 3 to 4 months, preferably with MRI, may allay their fears. </li>
        <li><em>Indeterminate &lt;1 cm lesion in a high-risk individual, with suspect metastatic disease, known EHM (variant 5)</em>: If a &lt;1 cm lesion is detected with US or CT and cannot be fully characterized, MR may characterize the lesion as a cyst, hemangioma, hamartoma, or focal fat. If MR does not characterize the lesion, short-term follow-up (3 to 6 months) is recommended. </li>
        <li><em>Indeterminate &lt;1 cm mass in a high-risk individual with underlying liver disease (variant 6)</em>: If an indeterminate &lt;1 cm lesion is detected with US in a patient with underlying liver disease, the differential diagnosis includes hyperplastic nodule, dysplastic nodule, or small HCC. Even though most of these lesions cannot be further characterized, given their size it is reasonable to obtain a multiphasic, enhanced CT or precontrast and postcontrast-enhanced MRI, with MRI preferred to CT. Likewise, if an indeterminate &lt;1 cm lesion is detected on a multiphasic, enhanced CT it is not unreasonable to seek further characterization with precontrast and postcontrast-enhanced MRI in 3 months. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>MRI without and with contrast is the technique of choice for the characterization of indeterminate focal liver lesions. This includes lesions of all sizes, even those &lt;1 cm. It also includes patients without or with either EHM or chronic liver disease. When either an MRI with contrast or a CT with contrast is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, especially when the estimated GFR (eGFR) is &lt;30 mL/min, an MRI without contrast is the technique of choice. </li>
    <li>CT with contrast is the technique of choice for the characterization of indeterminate focal liver lesions in patients who cannot undergo an MRI with contrast, including lesions of all sizes and in patients without or with an EHM or chronic liver disease. When a survey examination of the entire abdomen and pelvis or the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is needed for the evaluation of patients with an EHM, a CT with contrast is preferred to an MRI. For most indications, a CT with contrast is preferred to an MRI without contrast. A CT without contrast, however, has a very limited role in the characterization of indeterminate focal liver lesions. </li>
    <li>US has a limited role in the characterization of indeterminate focal liver lesions, although it can be useful for differentiating solid from cystic lesions. It is very useful for guiding the percutaneous biopsy of a focal liver lesion, assuming, of course, that the lesion is visible with US. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anticipated Exceptions</strong></p>
<p>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a disorder with a scleroderma-like presentation and a spectrum of manifestations that can range from limited clinical sequelae to fatality. It appears to be related to both underlying severe renal dysfunction and the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents. It has occurred primarily in patients on dialysis, rarely in patients with very limited glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (i.e., &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), and almost never in other patients. There is growing literature regarding NSF. Although some controversy and lack of clarity remain, there is a consensus that it is advisable to avoid all gadolinium-based contrast agents in dialysis-dependent patients unless the possible benefits clearly outweigh the risk, and to limit the type and amount in patients with estimated GFR rates &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.

<p>Staff search in PubMed only for peer reviewed medical literature for routine searches. Any article or guideline may be used by the author in the narrative but those materials may have been identified outside of the routine literature search process.</p>
<p>The Medline literature search is based on keywords provided by the topic author. The two general classes of keywords are those related to the condition (e.g., ankle pain, fever) and those that describe the diagnostic or therapeutic intervention of interest (e.g., mammography, MRI).</p>
<p>The search terms and parameters are manipulated to produce the most relevant, current evidence to address the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria (ACR AC) topic being reviewed or developed. Combining the clinical conditions and diagnostic modalities or therapeutic procedures narrows the search to be relevant to the topic. Exploding the term "diagnostic imaging" captures relevant results for diagnostic topics.</p>
<p>The following criteria/limits are used in the searches.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Articles that have abstracts available and are concerned with humans. </li>
    <li>Restrict the search to the year prior to the last topic update or in some cases the author of the topic may specify which year range to use in the search. For new topics, the year range is restricted to the last 10 years unless the topic author provides other instructions. </li>
    <li>May restrict the search to Adults only or Pediatrics only. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Rating Appropriateness</strong></p>
<p>The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures included in the Appropriateness Criteria topics are determined using a modified Delphi methodology. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff distributes surveys to the panelists along with the evidence table and narrative. Each panelist interprets the available evidence and rates each procedure. The surveys are completed by panelists without consulting other panelists. The appropriateness rating scale is an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category "usually not appropriate"; 4, 5, or 6 are in the category "may be appropriate"; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category "usually appropriate." Each panel member assigns one rating for each procedure for a clinical scenario. The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating.</p>
<p>If consensus is reached, the median rating is assigned as the panel's final recommendation/rating. Consensus is defined as eighty percent (80%) agreement within a rating category. A maximum of three rounds may be conducted to reach consensus. Consensus among the panel members must be achieved to determine the final rating for each procedure.</p>
<p>If consensus is not reached, the panel is convened by conference call. The strengths and weaknesses of each imaging procedure that has not reached consensus are discussed and a final rating is proposed. If the panelists on the call agree, the rating is proposed as the panel's consensus. The document is circulated to all the panelists to make the final determination. If consensus cannot be reached on the call or when the document is circulated, "No consensus" appears in the rating column and the reasons for this decision are added to the comment sections.</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to express individual interpretations of the evidence and his or her expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized and economical process. A more detailed explanation of the complete process can be found in additional methodology documents found on the <a href="http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Appropriateness-Criteria" title="ACR Web site">ACR Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<p>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a disorder with a scleroderma-like presentation and a spectrum of manifestations that can range from limited clinical sequelae to fatality. It appears to be related to both underlying severe renal dysfunction and the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents.

<p><strong>Relative Radiation Level</strong></p>
<p>Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria&reg; Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination.</p></div>
