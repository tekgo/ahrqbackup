<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grading of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, and <strong>Very Low</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong> or <strong>Weak</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>The authors recommend that Device Follow-Up Clinics (DFCs) integrate remote monitoring (RM) capability into their routine functions and include this service as part of the standard of care for cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIED) patients (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>).
    <p><em>Values and preferences</em>. The recommendation places great value on RM's ability to more quickly identify actionable CIED issues, reduce direct patient costs related to follow-up visits, and improve DFC workflow and efficiency. These benefits accrue without an increment in adverse events.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The authors recommend that RM should only be implemented in CIED patients who provide explicit consent after proper education about the nature of RM, its potential benefits and limitations, and how RM-transmitted information will be managed and used. The medicolegal implications of RM and the effect on patient privacy and confidentiality of personal health information should be included in such discussions (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence</strong>).
    <p><em>Values and preferences</em>. This recommendation places great value on the patient as an important stakeholder whose cooperation ensures the maximum benefit from RM.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Practical tip</em>. RM transmission has important privacy and confidentiality implications for which the patients need to be informed.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>The authors suggest that, in CIED patients in whom no device issues are identified, routine follow-up assessment during the maintenance phase should blend RM with in-clinic assessments beginning after the 3-month postimplant assessment, alternating assessments between in-clinic and RM transmissions in a 1:1 ratio (<strong>Conditional Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>).
    <p><em>Values and preferences</em>. This recommendation places great value on current CIED guideline recommendations concerning CIED follow-up assessment frequency and the need to integrate RM into, rather than superimpose RM on, the current assessment schedule. It also places value on patient convenience and DFC efficiency.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Practical tip</em>. There is insufficient scientific evidence to support implementation of any single RM schedule across all centres. The authors encourage centres to take a flexible approach, tailor RM follow-up to the individual patient, and to recognize that the 1:1 ratio serves as a starting point.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
    <li>The authors recommend that RM be used to supplement in-person monitoring of the patient and device in clinical circumstances that warrant more intensive surveillance of the CIED, and the evidence suggests that RM might be efficacious (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>).
    <p><em>Values and preferences</em>. This recommendation places value on the ability of RM to more frequently monitor CIED status and to quickly detect CIED system abnormalities with minimal negative effect on the patient.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The authors recommend that DFCs develop the infrastructure, resources, policies, and procedures to optimally support the RM program in a manner analogous to in-clinic assessment (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence</strong>).
    <p><em>Values and preferences</em>. The recommendation places value on the importance of careful planning and development of appropriate policies and procedures that reflect the values of the centre and the objectives of RM at the centre before initiating an RM program.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Practical tip</em>. RM improves DFC efficiency but has associated costs that need to be recognized and supported by centres through the allocation of sufficient resources.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li>The authors recommend that health professionals responsible for interpretation of RM transmissions and subsequent patient management decisions have the same qualifications, training, and experience as those performing in-clinic assessments (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence</strong>).
    <p><em>Values and preferences</em>. This recommendation places great value on RM data being as important and clinically useful as CIED gathered during in-clinic visits and the knowledge and expertise required to deal with RM data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The authors suggest that representatives of private industry involved in RM systems should provide support but should not have any direct involvement in RM-related patient care (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence</strong>).
    <p><em>Values and preferences</em>. Industry representatives are an important knowledge resource for DFC staff and have an important support role, but this recommendation places great value on the autonomy of DFCs and the confidentiality of CIED data. Those responsible for CIED patient care must have the necessary training and experience, and be accountable for patient management decisions made.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High Quality</strong>: Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate Quality</strong>: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low Quality</strong>: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Very Low Quality</strong>: Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong Recommendation</strong>: Based on the available evidence, if clinicians are very certain that benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks and burdens they will make a strong recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Weak Recommendation</strong>: Based on the available evidence, if clinicians believe that benefits and risks and burdens are finely balanced, or appreciable uncertainty exists about the magnitude of benefits and risks, they must offer a weak recommendation. In addition, clinicians are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of patient values and preferences in clinical decision making. When, across the range of patient values, fully informed patients are liable to make different choices, guideline panels should offer weak recommendations.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Available studies have consistently shown that remote monitoring (RM) reduces clinic visits and time to evaluation of clinical/arrhythmic events in cardiac pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) populations without increasing adverse events. Recent trials have demonstrated a reduction in inappropriate ICD therapies and hospitalizations with RM. RM consistently reduces direct patient costs and transportation and waiting time that might partially account for increased patient satisfaction. Though these conclusions cannot be extrapolated to all patient subgroups, such as those with substantial physical or cognitive impairments, the evidence to date demonstrates that RM is efficacious and safe and offers substantive benefits to patients and Device Follow-Up Clinic (DFC) staff.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implementation Issues</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Privacy and Medicolegal Issues</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, the medical information generated from cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIED) follow-up assessments at a Device Follow-Up Clinic (DFC) remains within the confines of the facility. Remote monitoring (RM) changes the paradigm by gathering electronic data into a data repository that is remote from the health facility, yet readily accessed and shared with various health care providers involved in a patient's care or can be used for research or educational purposes. With accessibility, however, come challenges to maintaining the privacy of patient health information and potential issues related to liability and reimbursement for RM-related services. Like other patient health information, data collected by RM are regulated by federal and provincial legislation but the fact that RM servers might be located outside of this country adds a degree of complexity and privacy risk that need to be addressed by centers before proceeding with RM implementation. Centers usually negotiate a formal RM service agreement with the RM vendor that addresses the responsibilities of all parties in maintaining patient confidentiality. Information contained in the RM service agreement should also be available to the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Reimbursement</strong></p>
<p>This review affirms that device follow-up care is a vital service that ensures patients derive maximum benefit from their CIED. RM extends the capacity of DFC to meet the needs of a growing burden of patients receiving CIED and has the capacity to achieve this more efficiently than in-clinic assessments. In light of the benefits of RM and because RM improves access to specialized CIED-related care, RM needs to be supported through adequate reimbursement of RM-related medical services that are rendered while professional bodies establish guidelines for appropriate use.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating Remote Monitoring into CIED Follow-up Assessments</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the original guideline document for a discussion highlighting important aspects of RM that DFC centres should address when developing an RM implementation strategy. The tables referred to in these sections are intended as tools to aid in RM implementation and are available online at the <a href="http://www.ccs.ca" title="Canadian Cardiovascular Society Web site">Canadian Cardiovascular Society Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).
