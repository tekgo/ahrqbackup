Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published between January 1, 1966 and December 31, 2014. Two electronic databases, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were searched. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the medical librarian using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies.</p>
<p>The task force supplemented searches of electronic databases with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The task force also searched the bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed below.</p>
<p>The task force made every effort to obtain a complete set of relevant articles to ensure the guideline is not based on a biased subset of articles. The specific search strategies for each question can be found in the full guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Seventy-eight citations were manually reviewed by the team with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined below. Two independent reviewers reviewed and abstracted full-text data for each article, and the 2 sets of data were compared for agreement by a third party. Inconsistencies were re-reviewed, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Only citations that considered adult patients focusing on surgical treatment of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) were considered. To be included in this guideline, an article has to be a report of a study that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having VSs </li>
    <li>Patients &ge;18 years of age </li>
    <li>Was in humans </li>
    <li>Published between January 1, 1966 and December 31, 2014 </li>
    <li>Quantitatively presented results </li>
    <li>Was not an in vitro study (for novel molecular markers, in vitro studies were included on patient samples) </li>
    <li>Was not a biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Was published in English </li>
    <li>Was not a meeting abstract, editorial, letter, or commentary </li>
    <li>Studies may include mixed pathology; however, the data pertaining to VSs were abstractable from the paper. </li>
    <li>&gt;5 patients or patient samples </li>
</ul>
<p>The task force did not include systematic reviews, guidelines, or meta-analyses conducted by others. These documents are developed using different inclusion criteria than those specified in this guideline. Therefore, they may include studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria used for this guideline. The task force recalled these documents if their abstract suggested that they might address one of the recommendations, and the bibliographies were searched for additional studies.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection, Quality Assessment, and Statistical Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>Articles that met the eligibility criteria were grouped according to the questions they addressed and used to create the evidence tables and scientific foundation sections. Reasons for exclusion for papers were also documented to be able to discuss pertinent problem citations in the scientific foundation as needed.</p>
<p>Studies that met the eligibility criteria were subject to more detailed scrutiny and had their data extracted by 1 reviewer and the extracted information was checked by 1 or more other reviewers. Evidence and summary tables, reporting the extracted study information and evidence classification, were generated for all the included studies for each of the questions. Evidence tables were created with the most recent data first and subsequent listings in retrograde chronological order. The table headings consisted of first author name and year, followed by a brief study description, chosen data class, and conclusion. The authors were directed to craft the data in the tables in a succinct and fact-filled manner to allow for rapid understanding of the literature entry by the readership. The literature in the evidence tables was expanded upon in the Results section of each guideline article to emphasize important points supporting its classification and contribution to recommendations. The method by which this was accomplished is expanded upon in the Joint Guideline Committee (JGC) Guideline Development Methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Internal drafts of the tables and manuscripts were developed by sharing them between writers electronically, by telephone, and in face-to-face meetings. Summary and conclusion statements were included for each section, with comments on key issues for future investigation being added where pertinent.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writing Group and Question Establishment</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the Joint Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) have prioritized an update of the guidelines for management of vestibular schwannomas (VSs). A series of writers were identified and screened for conflict of interest. This group in turn agreed on a set of questions addressing the topic at hand and conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the use of emerging therapies in patients with sporadic VSs. Additional details of the systematic review are provided below and within the introduction and methodology chapter of the original guideline document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification of Evidence and Guideline Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The concept of linking evidence to recommendations has been further formalized by the American Medical Association (AMA) and many specialty societies, including AANS, CNS, and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). This formalization involves the designation of specific relationships between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations to avoid ambiguity. In the paradigm for therapeutic maneuvers as used in this section, evidence is classified according to the scheme in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields). A basis for these guidelines can be viewed in the Joint Guidelines Committee methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables, and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

    <li>Aspirin is associated with less risk of tumor progression, with an odds ratio of 0.5 and a confidence interval of 0.29-0.85. Therefore, aspirin use may be useful in patients with vestibular schwannomas (VSs) undergoing observation. </li>
    <li>Several studies provide preliminary results that prehab and preoperative gentamicin ablation of the vestibular apparatus may improve postoperative recovery; however, formal data regarding recovery are lacking. </li>
    <li>Prehab and preoperative gentamicin ablation may provide unique opportunities in improving postoperative mobility for patients undergoing VS surgery where they have preoperative vestibular function. </li>
    <li>The summary of evidence suggests that endoscopic use for VS surgery does not appear to worsen outcome or complications. In addition, endoscopic assistance may aid in the prevention of postoperative CSF leaks by directly visualizing them for repair. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The Vestibular Schwannoma Guidelines Task Force members were required to report all possible conflicts of interest (COIs) prior to beginning work on the guideline, using the COI disclosure form of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Guidelines Committee, including potential COIs that are unrelated to the topic of the guideline. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair reviewed the disclosures and either approved or disapproved the nomination. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair are given latitude to approve nominations of Task Force members with possible conflicts and address this by restricting the writing and reviewing privileges of that person to topics unrelated to the possible COIs. The conflict of interest findings are provided in detail in the full-text introduction and methods manuscript (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>
