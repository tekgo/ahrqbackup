Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>Level A-U/R</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practice Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnosis with Clinical Examination and Electroencephalogram (EEG) Testing</em></p>
<p>The evidence for the utility of EEG theta/beta power ratio to augment a clinician's judgment when he or she is diagnosing possible attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not strong enough to make a recommendation. A test must have a demonstrated advantage over the existing common clinical practice to supersede that practice. A research study is the proper setting in which to demonstrate that the current clinical practice of using a clinical examination in evaluation for ADHD can be improved on.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should inform patients with suspected ADHD and their families that the EEG theta/beta power should not be used to confirm an ADHD diagnosis or to support further testing after a clinical evaluation, unless such diagnostic assessments take place within the limits of a research study (<strong>Level R</strong>).</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Level R recommendations are ones that "the guideline authors assert should be applied only in research settings."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p><em>Accuracy of EEG Theta/Beta Power Ratio</em></p>
<p>The authors downgraded their confidence in the evidence to moderate because of significant problems with generalizability (see appendix e-6 in the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Physicians pledge to do no harm when they take the Hippocratic Oath. There is a risk for significant harm to people misdiagnosed with ADHD because of an unacceptably high false-positive EEG result. Because of this risk of harm, the combination of theta/beta power ratio and frontal beta power should not be used in place of a standard clinical examination.</p>
<p><em>Recommendations</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should inform patients with suspected ADHD and their families that the combination of EEG theta/beta power ratio and frontal beta power should not replace a standard clinical evaluation <strong>(Level B)</strong>. There is a risk for significant harm to patients of being misdiagnosed with ADHD because of the unacceptably high false-positive diagnostic rate of EEG theta/beta power ratio and frontal beta power <strong>(Level B)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>American Academy of Neurology Rules for Classification of Evidence for Risk of Bias</strong></p>
<p><em>Diagnostic Scheme</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class I</span></p>
<p>A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class II</span></p>
<p>A case-control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study where a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data was collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Class III</span></p>
<p>A case-control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><em>Class IV</em></p>
<p>Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. <em>Must</em> recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>should</em>. <em>Should</em> recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb <em>may</em> or <em>might</em>. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that "must" be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that "should" be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that "might" be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A Level R designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention </li>
</ul></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The authors performed a comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index databases, without time constraints, using the keywords "ADHD," "EEG," "theta/beta ratio," and their associated variants. The initial literature search was performed on October 13 and 14, 2013, and was updated on March 12, 2015, with one final check on May 10, 2015. Appendix e-4 in the online Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) presents the complete search strategy. The search yielded 959 abstracts, and each abstract was reviewed for relevance by 2 authors working independently of each other. Articles were considered for inclusion if they (1) examined the theta/beta power ratio in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and (2) could address either of the clinical questions. Articles were excluded if they (1) enrolled fewer than 10 participants, which would have resulted in too great a risk of bias; (2) were rated as Class IV by American Academy of Neurology (AAN) criteria (including reviews and meta-analyses; see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field for classification of evidence scheme for diagnostic articles); or (3) studied ADHD as determined by clinical examination criteria other than those from the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition</em> (DSM-5) and its earlier variants. An additional criterion for exclusion was information not published in the peer-reviewed literature, with one exception. Data were provided to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based ADHD Assessment Aid (NEBA), a portion of which the authors obtained in self-published form. Additional information about the trial was found in the de novo FDA application. In this practice advisory, the authors include in their assessment both the published data and the data from the de novo FDA application.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>In October 2013, the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) convened a panel of experts to develop this practice advisory (see appendix e-2 and e-3 in the online Data Supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The panel followed the methods described in the 2011 edition of the AAN's guideline development process manual, as amended, including the process for developing practice advisories.</p>
<p>The guideline authors based the strength of the recommendations on results from a modified Delphi process to determine the weight of several factors, including the evidence rating, cost considerations, risks, and feasibility (see appendix e-8 in the online Data Supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>

Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, practice advisory projects. Drafts of the practice advisory have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, a network of neurologists, <em>Neurology</em>&reg; peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields.
