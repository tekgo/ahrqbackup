Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: Perioperative registered nurses (RNs) play a critical role in developing protocols for preoperative bathing, selecting and applying preoperative patient skin antiseptics, and facilitating appropriate hair removal when necessary. The original guideline document provides the perioperative RN and other perioperative team members with evidence-based practice guidance for preoperative patient skin antisepsis to promote patient safety and reduce the risk of surgical site infection (SSI).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>Patients should bathe or shower before surgery with either soap or an antiseptic. </li>
    <li>Hair removal at the surgical site should be performed only in select clinical situations. </li>
    <li>A multidisciplinary team including perioperative RNs, physicians, and infection preventionists should select safe and effective antiseptic products for preoperative patient skin antisepsis. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should apply the preoperative patient skin antiseptic in a safe and effective manner. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should review and follow the skin antiseptic manufacturer's instructions for use and safety data sheets (SDSs) for handling, storing, and disposing of skin antiseptics. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Evidence Review</strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic literature search of the databases MEDLINE&reg;, CINAHL&reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled and nonrandomized trials and studies, case reports, letters, reviews, and guidelines. Search terms included <em>surgical skin preparation, skin preparation, skin prep, skin antisepsis, skin antiseptic, sterile preparation, disinfectants, local anti-infective agents, antiseptic solution, preoperative care, perioperative nursing, preoperative, surgical procedures, surgical wound infection, skin, skin care, paint, scrub, antiseptic shower, antiseptic cloth, chlorhexidine wipe, preoperative shower, preoperative wash, preoperative bathing, bathing and baths, hair removal, shaving, depilation, depilatory, nonshaved, razor, clipping, clipper, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, iodine, iodophors, iodine compounds, 2-propanol, alcohols, baby shampoo, isopropyl alcohol, alcohol-based, parachoroxylenol, chloroxylenol, PCMX, DuraPrep, pHisoHex, Prevantics, Hibiclens, Techni-Care, Chlora-Prep, Betadine, Betasept, PVP-I Prep, ExCel AP, Castile, iodophor, cyanoacrylates, tissue adhesives, chemical burns, skin diseases, dermatitis, skin sensitivity, surgical fires, fires, flammability, flammable, penis, vagina, mucous membrane, stoma, fingernails, nail polish, artificial nails, jewelry, body piercing, body jewelry,</em> and <em>subdermal implant</em>.</p>
<p>The initial search, conducted on December 5, 2013, was limited to literature published in English between January 2006 and December 2013; however, the time restriction was not considered in subsequent searches. At the time of the search, the librarian also established weekly alerts on the topics included in the search and until February 2014, presented relevant alert results to the lead author.</p>
<p>Before the systematic search, the medical librarian had provided the lead author with a list of the citations from the 2008 revision of the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Recommended Practices for Preoperative Patient Skin Antisepsis for consideration for the 2014 revision. During the development of the guideline, the lead author requested additional articles that either did not fit the original search criteria or were discovered during the evidence appraisal process. Finally, the lead author and medical librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer&ndash;reviewed publications, studies that evaluated skin antisepsis as part of a bundle to prevent surgical site infection (SSI), and low-quality evidence when higher-quality evidence was available.</p>
<p>See Figure 1 in the original guideline document for a flow diagram of literature search results.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Reduction in the risk of the patient developing a surgical site infection (SSI) by removing soil and transient microorganisms at the surgical site. Refer to the original guideline document for more information concerning benefits of specific interventions.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The harms of preoperative patient bathing with an antiseptic may include skin irritation, allergic reaction, or unnecessary treatment with antiseptics. </li>
    <li>The benefits of a 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) shampoo may not outweigh the potential harms of CHG causing injury by contact with the eyes, ears, or mouth. </li>
    <li>Neonates, especially extremely premature neonates, are at an increased risk for skin irritation and chemical burns of the skin from both CHG and alcohol-based skin antiseptics. </li>
    <li>The harms of leaving the hair in place at the surgical site may include risk of fire. The risk of fire may be minimized by confining the hair with a water-soluble gel and non-metallic ties or with braids for longer hair. </li>
    <li>Some patients are susceptible to iodism from preoperative skin antisepsis with iodine and iodophor-based antiseptics.&nbsp;A literature review recommended minimizing neonatal iodine exposure because of the risk of significant iodine overload and severe transient hypothyroidism, especially in premature neonates with increased skin permeability and immature thyroid glands. </li>
    <li>Fragile skin or tissue, burns, and open wounds are at a high risk for skin injury during preoperative patient skin antisepsis. Vigorous skin antisepsis in areas of malignancy may potentially spread cancer cells. </li>
    <li>Flammable skin antiseptics are a fuel source and pose a fire hazard. The prevention of pooling of flammable skin antiseptics and allowing for the complete drying of the antiseptic to minimize the fire hazard is supported by published guidance. Disposal of unused flammable skin antiseptics must be handled in a manner to decrease the risk of fire and in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. </li>
    <li>Refer to the original guideline document for additional discussion of potential harms of specific interventions. Also refer to Table 2 in the original guideline document for considerations and cautions for use of specific skin antiseptics. </li>

<h2>Contraindications
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The presence of hair may contraindicate the use of flammable antiseptics according to manufacturers' instructions for use. A flammable antiseptic for preoperative skin antisepsis is contraindicated when the procedure involves an ignition source (e.g., electrosurgical unit [ESU], laser) and the solution is unable to dry completely in hair. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), alcohol-based skin antiseptics that wick into the patient's hair result in prolonged drying times. No evidence was found that describes the length or amount of hair that constitutes a fire risk during use of alcohol-based skin antiseptics. </li>
    <li>See Table 2 in the original guideline document for contradictions of specific preoperative skin antiseptics </li>
