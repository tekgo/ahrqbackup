<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Approach to Older Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR ] &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q1. What parameter should be used in older patients (a) to estimate kidney function and (b) for dose adaptation purposes?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) recommends using estimating equations that correct for differences in creatinine generation rather than plain serum creatinine measurements to assess kidney function in older patients (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends that there is insufficient evidence to prefer one estimating equation over another since all perform equally and substantial misclassification can occur with any of these equations when used in older patients with differing body composition (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends formal measurement of kidney function if more accurate and precise estimation of GFR is required (<strong>1B</strong>). The GDG suggests the use of Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine-cystatin (CKD-EPI<sub>Cr-Cyst</sub>) may be an acceptable alternative (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends taking account of kidney function when prescribing drugs whose active forms or metabolites are renally cleared (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests that for drugs with a narrow toxic/therapeutic range, regular measurement of serum concentrations can provide useful information. Differences in protein binding in relation to uremia may necessitate use of different target levels of total drug concentration (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q2. What is the most reliable risk model score to predict progression of CKD in older patients with advanced CKD (eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>)?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The GDG recommends that the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) performs sufficiently well for use in older patients with advanced CKD and eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>(<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q3: What is the most reliable risk prediction model to predict mortality in older and/or frail patients with advanced CKD (eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>)?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The GDG suggests using the Bansal score to predict individual 5-year risk of death before end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in non-frail older patients with CKD stage 3&ndash;5 (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests that in patients at low risk in the Bansal score, a score including the assessment of frailty as stated in question 4a be performed (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests that the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) score be used to predict the risk for mortality in older patients with CKD stage 5 (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q4a: What is the best alternative method to assess functional decline in older and/or frail patients with advanced CKD?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The GDG recommends a simple score be used on a regular basis to assess functional status in older patients with CKD stage 3b&ndash;5d with the intention to identify those who would benefit from a more in-depth geriatric assessment and rehabilitation (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends most simple scores, including self-report scales and field tests (sit-to-stand [STS], gait speed or 6-min walk test) have comparable and sufficient discriminating power to identify patients with decreased functional status (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q4b: Are interventions aimed at increasing functional status in older patients with renal failure (eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/ 1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>or on dialysis) of benefit?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The GDG recommends that exercise has a positive impact on the functional status of older patients with CKD stage 3b or higher (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests that exercise training be offered in a structured and individualized manner to avoid adverse events (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q5a: Which is the best alternative to evaluate nutritional status in older patients with advanced CKD 3b or higher (eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or on dialysis?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The GDG recommends the subjective global assessment (SGA) as the gold standard to assess nutritional status of older patients with CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR &lt; 45mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG suggests that in older patients on hemodialysis (HD), a score including serum albumin, body mass index (BMI), serum creatinine/body surface area (BSA) and normalized protein nitrogen appearance [nPNA]) may be used to assess nutritional status (<strong>2D</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q5b: Which interventions are effective in improving nutritional status in older/frail patients with advanced CKD (eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or on dialysis?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The GDG suggests a trial of structured dietary advice and support with the aim of improving nutritional status (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q6: What is the benefit of dialysis in frail and older patients?</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The GDG recommends the use of validated tools as explained in Q2 and Q3 to project likely outcomes and help decide the appropriateness of discussing options for renal replacement therapy (RRT) (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends that the option for conservative management (CM) be discussed during the shared decision-making process on different management options for ESKD (<strong>1D</strong>). </li>
    <li>The GDG recommends that the REIN score can be useful to stratify mortality risk of patients intending to start RRT (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Clinical Questions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Systematic Reviews</strong></p>
<p>With the final guideline scope as point of departure, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) identified specific research questions, for which a systematic review would be conducted. All questions addressed issues related to one of the following six areas:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for classification and dose adaptation </li>
    <li>Prognosticating rate of progression to end-stage renal disease </li>
    <li>Prognosticating risk of death in medium term periods </li>
    <li>Assessment of functional status and strategies to improve it </li>
    <li>Assessment of nutritional status and strategies to improve it </li>
    <li>Appraisal of benefits and drawbacks of renal replacement therapy (RRT) versus conservative care </li>
</ol>
<p>For additional details regarding the six areas, refer to the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Con Debates</strong></p>
<p>Besides these six predefined areas where a systematic review of the evidence was proposed, there also emerged different clinical questions where it was considered unlikely that a systematic review could provide substantial guidance. For these areas, it was decided to use a narrative approach to list arguments pro or con a certain management strategy in older (&gt;65 years) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b or higher. Within these pro&ndash;con debates, the GDG intended to cover the following areas:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Glycemic control in frail older patients with advanced kidney disease </li>
    <li>Hypertension control in frail older patients with advanced kidney disease </li>
    <li>Kt/V as an adequacy parameter in frail older patients </li>
    <li>Use of alternative dialysis regimens (prolonged slow dialysis, daily dialysis, nocturnal dialysis) in frail older patients </li>
    <li>Hemodialysis (HD) versus peritoneal dialysis (PD) and home versus center-based </li>
    <li>Criteria for and appropriateness of transplantation in older patients with end-stage renal failure </li>
</ol>
<p>For additional details regarding the point of debate for the six areas, refer to the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Review Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>The methods support team assisted in developing review questions, i.e., framing the clinical questions into a searchable format. This required detailed specification of the patient group (P), the intervention (I), the comparator (C) and the outcomes (O) for intervention questions and the patient group, index tests, reference standard and target condition for questions of diagnostic test accuracy. For each question, the guideline development group agreed upon explicit review question criteria including study design features. (See Appendix 2 in the original guideline document for detailed review questions and PICO tables.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Searching for Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>
<p>The European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) methods support team searched The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (May 2016), The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (May 2016), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (May 2016) and Medline (1946 to May, week 4, 2016) for all questions. The search strategies combined subject headings and text words for the patient population, index test and target condition for the diagnostic questions and subject headings and text words for the population and intervention for the intervention questions. The detailed search strategies are available in Appendix 3 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Reference lists from included publications were screened to identify additional papers. The methods support team also searched guideline databases and organizations including the National Guideline Clearinghouse, Guidelines International Network, Guidelines Finder, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and professional societies of Nephrology and Geriatric medicine for guidelines to screen the reference lists.</p>
<p><strong>Selection</strong></p>
<p>For diagnostic questions, the GDG included all studies that compared any of the predefined clinical or biochemical tests with a gold standard reference test. For intervention questions, the GDG included all studies in which one of the predefined interventions was evaluated in humans. The GDG excluded case series that reported on benefit if the number of participants was five or less, but included even individual case reports if they reported an adverse event. No restriction was made based on language.</p>
<p>The GDG used the Early Reference Organisation Software (EROS) (<a href="http://www.eros-systematic-review.org" title="EROS Web site">http://www.eros-systematic-review.org</a>) to organize the initial step of screening and selection of papers. The title and abstract of all papers retrieved by the original search were made available through this system to those responsible for screening. For each question, a member of the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) methods support team and one member of the GDG dedicated to this question independently screened all titles and abstracts and discarded any that were clearly irrelevant and those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies at this stage were resolved by consensus.</p>
<p>In a second round, full texts of potentially relevant studies were retrieved and independently examined for eligibility and final inclusion in the data extraction step. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If no consensus could be reached, the disagreement was settled by group arbitration. </p>
<p>The flow of the paper selection is presented for each question in Appendix 4 of the original guideline document.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Critical Appraisal of Individual Studies</span></strong>
<p>For each included study, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) collected relevant information on design, conduct and relevant results through a tailor-made Excel table. For each question, two reviewers independently extracted all data. The GDG produced tables displaying the data extraction of both reviewers. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus and if no consensus could be reached, disagreements were resolved by an independent referee. From these data extraction tables, the GDG produced merged consensus evidence tables for informing the recommendations. The evidence tables are available in Appendix 5 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Risk of bias of the included studies was evaluated using validated checklists, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. These were AMSTAR for systematic reviews, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Newcastle Ottawa scale for cohort and case&ndash;control studies and QUADAS for diagnostic test accuracy studies. Data were compiled centrally by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) methods support team.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Profiles</span></strong></p>
<p>For research questions regarding therapeutic interventions, the methods support team constructed evidence profiles using the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) toolbox' developed by the international GRADE working group (<a href="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/" title="GRADE Web site">http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/</a>). The evidence profiles include details of the quality assessment as well as summary&mdash;pooled or unpooled&mdash;outcome data, an absolute measure of intervention effect when appropriate and the summary of quality of evidence for each outcome. Evidence profiles were reviewed and approved with the rest of the guideline development group. Evidence profiles were constructed only for research questions addressed by at least two RCTs. If the body of evidence for a particular comparison of interest consisted of only one RCT or of solely observational data, the summary tables provided the final level of synthesis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rating the Quality of the Evidence for Each Outcome across Studies</span></strong></p>
<p>The GDG rated the overall quality of the evidence for each intervention separately addressing each outcome (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). In accordance with GRADE, the guideline development group initially categorized the quality of the evidence for each outcome as high if it originated predominantly from RCTs and as low if it originated from observational studies. The GDG subsequently downgraded the quality of the evidence one or two levels if results from individual studies were at high or very high risk of bias, there were serious inconsistencies in the results across studies, the evidence was indirect, the data were sparse or imprecise or publication bias was suspected. The quality of evidence arising from observational studies was upgraded if effect sizes were large, there was evidence of a dose&ndash;response gradient, or all plausible confounding would either reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results showed no effect (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). Uncontrolled case series and case reports automatically received downgrading from 'low' to 'very low' level of evidence for risk of bias, so that no other reasons for downgrading were marked.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Establishment of the Guideline Development Group</span></strong></p>
<p>As defined by the guideline development methodology (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) advisory board installed a steering group, which, after selection of the topics based on the systematic scoping procedure, selected further members of the Guideline Development Group (GDG). Members of the steering group and of the GDG were selected based on their clinical and research expertise and their willingness to invest the necessary time and effort to perform the task according to the proposed deadlines and the agreed methodology. The GDG consisted of content experts, including individuals with expertise in clinical geriatric medicine, general internal medicine, nutrition and clinical nephrology. In addition, experts in epidemiology and systematic review methodology were added to the GDG. The ERBP methods support team provided methodological input and practical assistance throughout the process.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formulating and Grading Statements</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Statements</strong></p>
<p>After the evidence tables and profiles had been prepared, revised and approved, the GDG formulated and graded the statements during a full-day plenary meeting.</p>
<p>Recommendations can be for or against a certain strategy. The GDG drafted the statements based on their interpretation of the available evidence. Individual statements were made and discussed in an attempt to reach group consensus. If the GDG could not reach consensus, it held a formal open vote by show of hands. An arbitrary 80% had to cast a positive vote for a statement to be accepted. Voting results and reasons for disagreement were specified in the rationale when applicable. In accordance with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), the GDG classified the strength of the statements as strong (coded 1) or weak (coded 2) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields in this summary and Figure 1 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Judgments around four key factors determined the strength of a recommendation: the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative therapeutic or diagnostic strategies, the quality of the evidence, the variability in values and preferences. The GDG did not conduct formal decision or cost analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Ungraded Statements</strong></p>
<p>The GDG decided to use an additional category of ungraded statements for areas where formal evidence was not sought and statements were based on common sense, or expert experience alone. The ungraded statements were generally written as simple declarative statements but were not intended to be stronger than level 1 or 2 recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writing the Rationale</span></strong></p>
<p>The GDG collated recommendations and ungraded statements for each clinical question in separate chapters structured according to a specific format. Each question resulted in one or more specific boxed statements. All statements were accompanied by their GRADE classification as level 1 or 2 (strength of recommendations) and A, B, C or D (quality of the supporting evidence).</p>
<p>These statements are followed by advice for clinical practice where relevant and the rationale of the statement. The rationale contains a brief section on 'why this question' with relevant background and justification of the topic, followed by a short narrative review of the evidence in 'what did we find?' and finally a justification of how the evidence was translated in the recommendations made in 'did we translate the evidence into the statement'.</p>
<p>When areas of uncertainty were identified, the GDG considered making suggestions for future research based on the importance to patients or the population, and on ethical and technical feasibility.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A draft version of the guideline was presented at the annual European Renal Association&ndash;European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) meeting in Vienna 2016. Attending participants could write down their comments and suggestions on the guideline through an electronic account.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Internal and External Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Internal Review</strong></p>
<p>A first draft of the guideline was sent to internal reviewers from the ERA-EDTA council and the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) advisory board. Internal reviewers were asked to comment on the statements and the rationale within free text fields. All these comments and suggestions were discussed during an ERBP advisory board meeting, during a meeting of the ERBP methods support team and during an additional teleconference meeting of the guideline development group. For each comment or suggestion, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) evaluated if it was needed to adapt the statement, again taking into account the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of the alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence and the variability in values and preferences.</p>
<p><strong>External Review</strong></p>
<p>All members of the ERA-EDTA had the option to provide comments through a Survey Monkey questionnaire.</p>
<p>All comments and suggestions were discussed with the GDG by e-mail, as well as during a final meeting of the co-chairs of the GDG, the methods support team and the chair of ERBP.</p>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Older people are often excluded from studies on which glomerular filtration rate (GFR) risk prediction scores are based. Hence it is unclear whether current risk prediction scores perform adequately in older people. The Kidney Failure Risk Equations (KFREs) developed by Tangri et al. performed well and have been well validated, though they require the application of a correction factor in non-North American populations. </li>
    <li>Estimating equations cannot be reliably used in patients with acute changes in kidney function.</li>
    <li>Undertaking dialysis affects quality of life, and providing some symptom relief comes at the cost of significant burdens for the patient, and their families and carers.</li>

European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) felt that excluding all individuals with some degree of potential conflict of interest would make assembling a GDG impossible. Therefore, members of the GDG were allowed to have past financial and/or intellectual conflicts of interest. No consequences were attached to the stated interests, but the authors insisted on transparency.
