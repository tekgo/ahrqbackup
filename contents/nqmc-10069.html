Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percent of patients at discharge or at annual review who responded positively to the "Empowerment" domain on the Inpatient Consumer Survey (ICS). </p>
<p>The individual questions of the survey that pertain to the "Empowerment" domain are:</p>
<p><em>During my hospital stay...</em>:</p>
<ul class="NoBullets">
    <li>Q25. I had a choice of treatment options </li>
    <li>Q26. My contact with my doctor was helpful </li>
    <li>Q27. My contact with nurses and therapist was helpful </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: The "Empowerment" domain is one of six domains contained in the <a href="/browse/by-organization-indiv.aspx?orgid=2567&amp;objid=49021" title="Measure Collection">Inpatient Consumer Survey (ICS)</a>.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Scoring the domains</strong>: Each question is evaluated on a scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. For purposes of computing averages, a number value is given to the qualities of the scale from 1 for strongly disagree to 5 for strongly agree. A patient must respond to a minimum of 2 questions in order for an average rating to be computed for the domain. Since there are only 3 to 4 questions in a domain, missing values are not inserted when a patient does not answer a question. When the average rating for the questions in the domain is greater than 3.5, the patient is considered to have "responded positively" to the domain. Then the proportion of patients who responded positively to the domain is determined as the ratio of the number of patients who responded positively to all patients who responded to the domain.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Inpatient Consumer Survey (ICS) includes 28 survey items that draw out the voice of the mental health patients in multiple dimensions of care, including being treated with dignity, patient rights, patient participation in treatment planning, medication, interactions with key hospital staff, and personal perception of outcomes. Direct feedback from patients in areas such as dignity and rights could inform the therapeutic interactions between staffs and patients which will ultimately produce better quality of life outcomes. These intermediate outcomes may foretell the likelihood that the patient may return to receive further services when needed and participate in services in other venues. Direct feedback on outcomes and participation in treatment could inform the treatment activities and greater involvement of patients in their own recovery. Each domain is comprised of distinct questions to enable the health care provider to target specific areas of performance.</p>
<p>Ultimately, empowerment must be evaluated from the perspective of the person who receives services from the healthcare organization. The provision of services should be in an atmosphere where patients feel that they, interactively with their doctors and therapist, learn more about their illness and about their treatment options, and are encouraged to determine their best path to recovery. Patients' report of the effectiveness of the organization in enabling this respectful, compassionate, and supportable encounter among patients and health care professionals' empowerment, is an important dimension of the quality of care of the organization.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Methods</strong><br />
To psychometrically test the structure of the Inpatient Consumer Survey (ICS), 34,878 survey results, submitted by 90 psychiatric hospitals in 2008, were extracted from the Behavioral Healthcare Performance Measurement System (BHPMS). Basic descriptive item-response and correlation analyses were performed for total surveys. Two datasets were randomly created for analysis. A random sample of 8,229 survey results was used for exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Another random sample of 8,261 consumer survey results was used for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). This same sample was used to perform validity and reliability analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong><br />
The item-response analysis showed that the mean range for a disagree/agree five-point scale was 3.10 to 3.94. Correlation analysis showed a strong relationship between items. Six domains (dignity, rights, environment, empowerment, participation, and outcome) with internal reliabilities between good to moderate (0.87 to 0.73) were shown to be related to overall care satisfaction. Overall reliability for the instrument was excellent (0.94). Results from CFA provided support for the domains structure of the ICS proposed through EFA.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
The overall findings from this study provide evidence that the ICS is a reliable measure of consumer satisfaction in psychiatric inpatient settings. The analysis has shown the ICS to provide valid and reliable results and to focus on the specific concerns of consumers of psychiatric inpatient care. Scores by item indicate that opportunity for improvement exists across healthcare organizations.</p>

The outcome of a series of meetings was an instrument consisting of 43 total items organized around six conceptual domains and a plan for implementation and analysis. </p>
