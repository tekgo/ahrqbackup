Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em><strong>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong></em>: The following guidance was current as of October 2013. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/allergic.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text of the original guideline document for detailed information on each of the screening procedures.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Aspects &amp; Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Allergic rhinitis is an antigen-mediated inflammation of the nasal mucosa that may extend into the paranasal sinuses. Diagnosis is usually made by history and examination ("itchy, runny sneezy, stuffy"). A symptom diary and a trial of medication may be helpful to confirm a diagnosis. Allergy testing is not commonly needed to make the diagnosis, but may be helpful for patients with multiple potential allergen sensitivities.</p>
<p><strong>Therapy</strong></p>
<p>The goal of therapy is to relieve symptoms.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoidance</span> of allergens is the first step <em>[IA]</em>. (Refer to text in the original guideline document for details). If avoidance fails: </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An over-the-counter (OTC), non-sedating antihistamine (loratadine [Claritin]</span>, cetirizine [Zyrtec], <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fexofenadine</span> [Allegra]) should be tried initially. They provide relief in most cases. They prevent and relieve nasal itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea, and ocular symptoms, but tend to be less effective for nasal congestion <em>[IA]</em>. If symptoms persist consider the following options: </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other medications</span>:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intranasal corticosteroids (prescription only)</span> are the most potent medications available for treating allergic rhinitis <em>[IA]</em>. They control itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and stuffiness in most patients, and may help ocular symptoms. They have a relatively good long-term safety profile. Generic intranasal corticosteroids for adults and children are: fluticasone (Flonase), triamcinolone acetonide (Nasacort AQ), and flunisolide (Nasarel). </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oral decongestants (OTC)</span> decrease swelling of the nasal mucosa which, in turn, alleviates nasal congestion <em>[IA]</em>. They can be combined with oral antihistamines or other agents. However, they are associated with appreciable side effects, especially in geriatric patients, and should only be considered when congestion is not controlled by other agents. They are contraindicated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), in uncontrolled hypertension, and in severe coronary artery disease and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leukotriene inhibitors</span> (prescription-only) are less effective than intranasal corticosteroids <em>[IIA]</em>. Consider using for patients who cannot tolerate first line agents or have co-morbid asthma. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intranasal cromolyn (OTC)</span> is less effective than intranasal corticosteroids <em>[IIA]</em>. Cromolyn is a good alternative for patients who are not candidates for corticosteroids. It is most effective when used regularly prior to the onset of allergic symptoms. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intranasal antihistamines (azelastine)</span>, while effective in treating the nasal symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial rhinitis and nonallergic vasomotor rhinitis, offer no therapeutic benefit over conventional treatment and incur additional cost <em>[IIA]</em>. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ocular preparations</span> should be considered for patients with allergic conjunctivitis who are not adequately controlled with or cannot tolerate an oral antihistamine or high dose nasal steroids, which do provide some improvement in ocular symptoms <em>[IIA]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Referral</strong></p>
<p>Appropriate criteria for referral may include identification of specific allergens through testing, intolerance to or failure of medical therapy, severe reactions, associated comorbid conditions, or desire for immunotherapy <em>[ID]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Controversial Issues</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medication vs. immunotherapy</span>. A formal cost-benefit analysis of medication therapy versus immunotherapy (allergy shots) has not been performed; however, patients with moderate to severe symptoms that continue year round (seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis) may benefit most from immunotherapy <em>[IID]</em>. Allergen immunotherapy can be cost effective in children with asthma.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Considerations</span>. Certain patient groups (pediatrics, geriatrics, and severe asthmatics) may pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The literature search for this update began with the results of the literature searches performed for the 2002 and 2007 versions of this guideline. Also referenced was the search performed for Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) 2010 revision. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO), which included literature through August 2007. A search for literature published since that time was performed. The search on Medline was conducted prospectively for literature published from 8/1/07 to 3/30/12 using the major keywords of: allergic rhinitis, human (adult and pediatric), English language, clinical guidelines, controlled trials and meta analyses, and cohort studies. Separate searches were performed for: history (inciting factors, seasonality, family history, severity &amp; severity scoring), physical exam, signs, symptoms (nasal exam for changes in mucosa, conjunctival changes), laboratory (nasal smear for presence of <span>eosinophils</span>, skin testing, RAST), Diagnosis&ndash;other references, control triggers, corticosteroids (intra-nasal, ocular), antihistamines (intra-nasal, oral, ocular), leukotriene inhibitors/modulators, decongestants (intra-nasal, ocular, oral), mast cell stabilizers (intra-nasal, ocular), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (ocular), anticholinergics (intra-nasal), omalizumab, saline irrigation to remove allergens (nasal spray, eye wash), immunotherapy/allergy shots or inhaler, turbinate reduction surgery, integrative/alternative/complementary medicine, pregnancy and lactation), treatment or management&ndash;other references, geriatric patients, cost and cost-effectiveness, other references.</p>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p></div>
