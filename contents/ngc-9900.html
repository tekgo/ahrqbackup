<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>A-C</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cervical preparation is recommended before dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) to decrease risk of cervical trauma. </li>
    <li>Mifepristone followed in 24&ndash;48 hours by misoprostol is the most effective regimen for second-trimester medical abortion. </li>
    <li>Misoprostol as a single agent is effective for medical abortion. </li>
    <li>Administration of prophylactic antibiotics decreases the risk of infection after surgical abortion and, therefore, should be provided to all patients undergoing D&amp;E. </li>
    <li>Except for hysteroscopic sterilization, diaphragm, or cervical cap, all forms of contraception can be considered after second-trimester abortion and initiated on the day of the procedure. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>D&amp;E is associated with fewer complications than medical abortion involving misoprostol regimens. </li>
    <li>When there is a suspicion of abnormal placentation, D&amp;E is the preferred abortion method, and preparations should be made for possible hemorrhage by ensuring the procedure is performed at an appropriate facility with accessibility to blood products, interventional radiology, and the capability to perform a hysterectomy if necessary. </li>
    <li>The use of vasopressin in the paracervical block may decrease blood loss from D&amp;E. </li>
    <li>Methylergonovine maleate is an appropriate first-line uterotonic agent unless contraindicated, as in patients with hypertension. Misoprostol is an effective agent in the setting of postabortion hemorrhage, and doses of 800&ndash;1,000 micrograms are recommended. </li>
    <li>If refractory bleeding is thought to be due to atony or lower uterine segment bleeding, a Foley catheter or intrauterine balloon should be inserted to tamponade the endometrial cavity. </li>
    <li>Because the risk of uterine rupture associated with prior cesarean delivery is similar to the risk among women without a prior cesarean delivery, guidelines support the safety of misoprostol specifically and medical abortion generally in women with one prior cesarean delivery. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In order to ensure access to D&amp;E, residency training programs should offer integrated abortion training that includes second-trimester D&amp;E. </li>
    <li>All physicians should facilitate timely referrals for abortion care to reduce delays in accessing services. </li>
    <li>Interventions to improve and facilitate early identification of pregnancy should be encouraged, including efforts to educate women about the signs and symptoms of pregnancy. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong> Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong> Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong> Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong> Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong> Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 1990 to November 2012. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists were used.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate provision and management of second-trimester abortion </li>
    <li>Decreased incidence of complications </li>
    <li>Medical abortions involving mifepristone combined with misoprostol have faster times to completion, decreased hospital time, and a lower risk of retained placenta, compared with regimens with misoprostol used alone. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The mortality rate associated with abortion is low (0.6 per 100,000 legal, induced abortions), and the risk of death associated with childbirth is approximately 14 times higher than that with abortion. </li>
    <li>Rare complications associated with both dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) and medical abortion include hemorrhage, cervical laceration, retained products of conception, and infection. Uterine perforation can occur with D&amp;E, whereas uterine rupture can occur with medical abortion. </li>
    <li>Other rare complications may include disseminated intravascular coagulation and embolism. </li>
    <li>Adverse events, such as pain and gastrointestinal adverse effects can occur. </li>
