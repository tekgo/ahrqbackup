Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendations (<strong>Level 1-3</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recommendation</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong></p>
<p>Treatment with bevacizumab is recommended as it provides improved disease control compared to historical controls as measured by best imaging response and progression free survival at 6 months.</p>
<p>Given that there are a large number of therapies are available for progressive glioblastoma that may be applied under selected circumstances dependent on patient characteristics and treating physician judgment, it is strongly recommended that patients with progressive glioblastoma be enrolled in properly designed clinical investigations to provide convincing evidence of therapeutic value.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definition</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Classification for Therapeutic Studies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Evidence provided by one or more well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials, including overview (meta-analyses) of such trials</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Evidence provided by well-designed observational studies with concurrent controls (e.g., case control and cohort studies)</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Evidence provided by expert opinion, case series, case reports and studies with historical controls</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Classification for Diagnostic Studies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Evidence provided by one or more well-designed clinical studies of a diverse population using a "gold standard" reference test in a blinded evaluation appropriate for the diagnostic applications and enabling the assessment of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and where applicable, likelihood ratios</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Evidence provided by one or more clinical studies of a restricted population using a "gold standard" reference test in a blinded evaluation of diagnostic accuracy and enabling assessment of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and where applicable, likelihood ratios</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Evidence provided by expert opinion, studies that do not meet the criteria for the delineation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and where applicable, likelihood ratios</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong>: Generally accepted principles for patient management, which reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (usually this requires Class I evidence which directly addresses the clinical questions or overwhelming Class II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials)</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong>: Recommendations for patient management which reflect clinical certainty (usually this requires Class II evidence or a strong consensus of Class III evidence)</p>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong>: Other strategies for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion)</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The following electronic databases were searched from January 1990 through June 2012: MEDLINE and EMBASE. A broad search strategy using a combination of subheadings and text words was employed. In brief, a search was executed for progressive glioblastoma treatment with targeted therapies. Specifically that included progressive, recurrent, or relapsing glioma or glioblastoma and combined with targeted therapy and molecular agents and then quality of life, survival and mortality. The search strategy is documented in the companion document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Reference lists of included studies were also reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Literature Eligibility Criteria</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Published in English </li>
    <li>Adult patients (age &ge;18) with progressive glioblastoma were included in the study and the data on their outcomes could be separated from other histologies </li>
    <li>Fully published (i.e., not in abstract form) peer reviewed primary studies involving targeted therapy used alone or in combinations </li>
    <li>Number of study participants with progressive glioblastoma &ge;5 </li>
    <li>For studies with mixed histologic populations, baseline pretreatment and outcome information on study participants is provided for patients with progressive glioblastoma separate from other histologies </li>
    <li>For studies with consideration of more than one treatment regimen, baseline pretreatment and outcome information on study participants is provided in a manner that can be separated by treatment </li>
</ul></div>
</div>

<h3>
Number of Source Documents
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The search resulted in 232 publications being identified as having potential relevance. Importantly the search for  cytotoxic chemotherapy related publications identified a number of manuscripts also dealing with targeted therapies and resulted in additions to this group. A total of 1,673 publications were identified by the search method and underwent title and abstract screening. Of those, 299 were deemed better information regarding this guideline.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Studies which met the eligibility criteria had their data extracted by one reviewer and the extracted information was checked by a second reviewer. Evidence and summary tables, reporting the extracted study information and evidence classification, were generated for all of the included studies for each of the questions. The literature in the evidence tables was expanded upon in the scientific foundation of each section so as to emphasize important points supporting its classification and contribution to recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Writing groups were created from the entire clinical guideline panel based on expertise to address each of the disciplines and areas of therapy chosen to be part of this set of clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence/summary tables for their specific discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel for feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p>
<p>Both the evidence classification and the strength of the recommendations were graded according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields). The class of evidence assigned to each study was based on study design (i.e., class I, II, or III). The strength of the recommendations made (i.e., level 1, 2, or 3) was directly linked to the evidence classification and took into account aspects of study quality and whether or not the plan was accomplished, not just study design. Specifically, the level of a recommendation made could be decreased, based on consensus input, if there were methodological concerns regarding the studies that provided evidence for that particular recommendation.</p>
<p>See Figure 1 in the methodology document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for an outline of the key steps in the process of developing these clinical practice guidelines.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The completed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of progressive glioblastoma were presented to the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) for approval. The reviewers for the JGC were vetted by the Journal of Neuro-Oncology for suitability and expertise to serve as reviewers for the purposes of publication in that journal also. As part of their evaluation process, the JGC reviewers could provide input on the content of the clinical practice guidelines.</p>
<p>Development of this set of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines was editorially independent from the funding agencies. The funding agencies (CNS Executive Committee, and AANS/CNS Joint Tumor Section Executive Committee) review of these guideline papers, following JGC assessment and recommendations for endorsement but prior to submission for publication, was limited to whether or not to endorse or reject this body of work.</p></div>
