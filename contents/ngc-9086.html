Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) is established as effective to predict an increased risk of the adverse outcomes of paraparesis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia in spinal surgery (4 Class I and 7 Class II studies).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Surgeons and other members of the operating team should be alerted to the increased risk of severe adverse neurologic outcomes in patients with important IOM changes (<strong>Level A</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>In practice, after being alerted to IOM changes, the operating team intervenes to attempt to reduce the risk of adverse neurologic outcomes. No studies in humans have directly measured the efficacy of such interventions. However, multiple controlled studies in animals have demonstrated that intervening after IOM alerts (as opposed to not intervening) reduces the risk of permanent neurologic injury. On this basis, it seems reasonable to assume that such interventions might improve outcomes in humans as well. It is unlikely that controlled human studies designed to determine the efficacy of post-IOM alert interventions will ever be performed.</p>
<p>This analysis did not compare motor-evoked potential (MEP) with sensory-evoked potential (SEP). The 2 techniques differ slightly. MEP more directly monitors the motor pathway itself. One technique may change while the other remains stable, or one may change earlier than the other. MEP requires more restrictive anesthesia requirements, causes patient movement, and has less-clear criteria for raising an alarm. SEP can localize an injury or site of ischemia more exactly. The transcranial electrical MEPs (tceMEPs) are often used intermittently because of movements that occur with the stimulus. Sometimes one technique can be accomplished throughout a case, whereas the other techniques cannot. As a result, it may be most appropriate for the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and neurophysiologic monitoring team to choose which techniques are most appropriate for an individual patient. Conducting both techniques together is a reasonable choice for many patients. Neither technique can predict the onset of paraplegia that is delayed until hours or days after the end of surgery. Neither technique should be considered to have perfect predictive ability when no evoked potential change is seen; rare false-negative monitoring has occurred.</p>
<p>The studies reported in the guideline varied somewhat in the criteria used to raise alerts. The specific criteria used are reported in table e-1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>These IOM studies involved a knowledgeable professional clinical neurophysiologist supervisor. These studies support performance of IOM when conducted under the supervision of a clinical neurophysiologist experienced with IOM. IOM conducted by technicians alone or by an automated device is not supported by the studies reported here because these studies did not use that practice model and because there is a lack of identified well-designed published outcomes studies demonstrating efficacy with those practice models.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Diagnostic Accuracy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study where a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data was collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2012 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A research librarian performed literature searches of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases using the following keywords: monitoring, intraoperative, evoked potentials, paralysis, and intraoperative complications. Additional articles were found from among the references cited in the reports reviewed. Each article was reviewed independently by at least 2 panel members. Appendix e-3 of the original guideline document presents the complete MEDLINE search strategy, and appendix e-4 presents the complete EMBASE search strategy.</p>
<p>The panel elected to focus on the 2 most common current spinal cord intraoperative monitoring (IOM) techniques. The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) technique evaluated was ankle-wrist stimulation with neck-scalp recording. The motor evoked potential (MEP) technique evaluated was transcranial electrical MEP with muscle recording.</p>
<p>Minimum size for study inclusion was 100 patients for orthopedic procedures and 20 patients for neurosurgical or cardiothoracic procedures. Different numbers were used because the rates of adverse neurologic outcomes are lower for orthopedic spine procedures compared with those for neurosurgical and cardiothoracic procedures.</p>
<p>A study was included if it represented a consecutive series of a representative group of patients, preferably prospective; if the IOM followed a protocol established in advance; if the IOM changes were identified in real time, before outcomes were known; and if the clinical outcomes of interest (paraparesis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia) were clearly reported.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2014 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>MEDLINE was searched from January 2011 to April 2014 using the following search terms: monitoring, intraoperative, evoked potentials, paralysis, and intraoperative complications. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the search were humans only, relevant to clinical questions; criteria used to screen search results were the same described in the 2012 published guideline.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Reports were reviewed and scored independently by all content expert panelists. Those panelists discussed and resolved by consensus the methodology, results, relevance, and conclusions for a few reports for which there was initial panel discrepancy.</p>
<p>Next, these articles were rated using the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 4-tiered (Class I&ndash;Class IV) classification of evidence scheme for rating diagnostic studies (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field), and conclusions and recommendations were linked to the strength of the evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). All articles that were rated Class I or Class II are listed in table e-1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The primary data evaluated were the results from a comparison of the group without evoked potential (EP) changes with the group with EP changes in both the number of cases with new postoperative paraparesis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia and the number without these conditions. Descriptive statistics and the Fisher exact test were used for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The search identified an initial set of 604 reports. Of those, 40 articles met the inclusion criteria, but 28 were subsequently excluded because they contained Class III or IV data; did not address the outcomes of paraparesis, paraplegia, or quadriplegia; primarily assessed nerve roots instead of the spinal cord; or substantially relied on techniques beyond the scope of this guideline. Twelve studies provide evidence to assess the role of intraoperative monitoring (IOM) in the prediction of adverse outcomes (table e-1), 4 of which were Class I.</p></div>

<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) member who had expertise in neuromuscular disorders conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists.</p></div>
