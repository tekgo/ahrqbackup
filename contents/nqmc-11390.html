<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the proportion of all adult patient-months (Medicare and non-Medicare patients) with three-month rolling average of total uncorrected serum or plasma calcium greater than 10.2 mg/dL (hypercalcemia).</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The hypercalcemia measure was developed in 2010 based on the recommendations of a clinical technical expert panel's (TEP's) consideration of the multiple large, risk-adjusted observational studies demonstrating a consistent relationship between presence of hypercalcemia and patient mortality. TEP members felt that while small, the population of patients with hypercalcemia was at increased risk of cardiovascular events and therefore the condition needs to be identified and appropriately treated. The TEP agreed that therapy should be focused on preventing the development of a sustained serum calcium greater than 10.2 mg/dL. The measure was re-evaluated by a second clinical TEP in 2013. The 2013 TEP identified additional observational studies supporting the measure and affirmed their agreement with the measure's focus as a safety measure, emphasizing avoidance of hypercalcemia to prevent adverse clinical consequences.</p>
<p>Given both the 2010 TEP and 2013 TEP recommendations, and the additional evidence cited in the current National Quality Forum (NQF) submission, the measure remains an importance as a intermediate outcome and patient safety measure, even in light of the lack of interventional trials supporting a specific threshold. Nevertheless, the number of large, risk-adjusted observational studies with consistent direction of association between hypercalcemia and mortality cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Given this, several committee reviewers agreed with the prior TEP's opinions that the measure represented an appropriate safety-net. As an additional concern, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 mandated the implementation of conditions treated through oral-only medications in the End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP) as a safety measure against over-use of oral-only medications following changes to the ESRD Prospective Payment System (PPS) Bundle payment. Congress likely recognized the need for more safety measures in the ESRD program, particularly in the area of drug overuse, following similar concerns for the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in treating anemia in the same population. This hypercalcemia measure is the only measure of which the developer is aware that meets these requirements and the NQF criteria.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility level monthly and annual performance scores. 5,880 facilities that had at least 11 eligible patients were included in the testing. This included a total of 482,444 patients. </p>
<p>The developer assessed reliability by calculating facility-level Pearson correlation coefficients between the current performance month and the preceding month for reporting months during January 2013&ndash;December 2013. In addition, the developer calculated inter-unit reliability (IUR) for each reporting month and the overall 12 months. The monthly based measure was a simple average across individuals in the facility. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based measure, however, is not a simple average and the developer instead estimates the IUR using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficients of each pair of the current and the preceding month ranged from 0.78 to 0.84. All were statistically significant (p less than 0.0001), indicating this measure is reliable over time. </p>
<p>The monthly IURs ranged from 0.61 to 0.66, which indicates that more than half of the variation in the monthly based measure can be attributed to the between facility differences and less than half to within facility variation. The annual IUR across the 12 reporting months was 0.86, which indicates that 86% of the variation in the yearly based measure can be attributed to the between facility variation. </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The IURs provide evidence of reliability in that most of the variation can be attributed to the between facility variation. The monthly and overall IURs suggest this measure is reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution. The moderate to strong statistically significant results of the Pearson correlations indicates this measure is reliable over time. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility level monthly and annual performance scores. 5,880 facilities that had at least 11 eligible patients were included in the testing. This included a total of 482,444 patients. </p>
<p>The developer assessed validity using Poisson regression models to identify the predictive strength of facility level performance scores for the measure, on mortality, using the 2013 standardized mortality ratio (SMR). </p>
<p>In 2010, the measure was unanimously ratified by the clinical technical expert panel (TEP) as a valid measure. </p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Poisson regression modeling was used to assess the predictive strength of facility level performance scores for hypercalcemia on mortality, using the 2013 NQF endorsed SMR. The results suggest the measure performance scores were predictive of mortality as measured by the SMR. For instance, the facility-level relative risk of mortality for a 10% increase in percent of patients with hypercalcemia, is 1.07 (p less than 0.0001). </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The results of the Poisson regression suggest that facilities with a higher percentage of patient-months with hypercalcemia experience a higher standardized mortality rate relative to facilities with a lower percentage of patients with hypercalcemia. The direction of the relationship is as expected. </p></div>
