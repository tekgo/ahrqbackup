Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 years and older who filled at least two prescriptions for a beta-blocker or beta-blocker combination on two unique dates of service who met the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) threshold of 80% during the measurement period.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Adherence to beta-blocker medication is important for chronic treatment of heart failure, hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart arrhythmias and other chronic conditions. Beta-blockers are considered essential medications for patients with heart failure. Use of beta-blockers is linked to the avoidance of hospitalization and decreased mortality.</p>
<p>Medications are the primary therapy for the most common diseases afflicting persons in the United States. There is evidence to support improvements in health for patients who are adherent to medications. For patients who have had a myocardial infarction, those who achieved adherence to statins, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE/ARBs), measured by proportion of days covered (PDC) greater than 80% had significantly better disease-free survival. (Choudhry et al., 2014)</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure was pilot tested during measure development (see process below), which included reliability and validity testing.</p>
<p><strong>Process for Development and Testing of Performance Measures </strong></p>
<p>Step 1: Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) workgroups identify measure concepts that may be appropriate for development into fully specified performance measures. The workgroups focus on specific aspects of the medication-use system and/or specific therapeutic areas. The workgroups are open to all members of PQA and use a consensus-based approach to identify, prioritize and recommend the measure concepts that are deemed to be highly important for supporting quality improvement related to medications. </p>
<p>Step 2: The measure concepts that are recommended for further development through a vote by the PQA workgroups are forwarded to the PQA Quality Metrics Expert Panel (QMEP) for evaluation and refinement. The QMEP reviews the measure concepts to provide an initial assessment of the key properties of performance measures (i.e., feasibility, usability and scientific validity). The measure concepts that are rated highly on these key properties will then undergo technical specification. </p>
<p>Step 3: The draft measure is provided to PQA member organizations for their comments prior to preparing technical specifications for pilot testing. The QMEP reviews member comments, edits the draft measure accordingly and poses testing questions based on this all-member feedback. </p>
<p>Step 4: PQA selects partners to test the draft measure. These partners are often PQA member health plans or academic institutions with expertise in quality and performance measure testing. The testing partner implements the draft technical specifications with their existing datasets and provides a report to PQA that details testing results and recommendations for modifications of the technical specifications. </p>
<p>Step 5: The workgroup that developed the measure reviews the testing results and provides comment. The QMEP reviews the workgroup comments, testing results, recommendations and potential modifications and provides a final assessment of the feasibility and scientific validity of the draft performance measures.</p>
<p>Step 6: Measures that are recommended by the QMEP for endorsement are posted on the PQA web site for member review, written comments are requested, and a conference call for member organizations is scheduled to address any questions. This process allows members to discuss their views on the measures in advance of the voting period. </p>
<p>Step 7: PQA member organizations vote on the performance measure(s) considered for endorsement.</p></div>
