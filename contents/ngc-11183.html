Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of recommendation (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak/conditional</strong>) and levels of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low</strong> or <strong>very low</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. Refer to the original guideline document for grading of the evidence quality.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results for Massive Transfusion (MT)/Damage Control Resuscitation (DCR) Protocol Use (Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome [PICO] 1)</span></strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with severe trauma, should an MT/DCR protocol versus no MT/DCR protocol be used to decrease mortality or total blood products used?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>In formulating a recommendation for the implementation of PICO 1, the guideline authors considered that many patients with hemorrhage presenting to a trauma center would place a high value on a rapid and well-coordinated resuscitation effort focused on arresting hemorrhage, reversing shock, and preventing coagulopathy. The risks of applying an MT/DCR protocol seem to be low, and use of an MT/DCR protocol is associated with a significant survival benefit. Based on this evidence, eight authors (73%) voted for a strong recommendation, while three (27%) voted for a conditional recommendation. Thus, the guideline authors recommend the development and implementation of an MT/DCR protocol for the management of severely injured trauma patients. This should be done with multidisciplinary input using the most current evidence to guide indications for protocol activation (Callcut et al., 2013), the target blood product ratios implicit within the protocol, and the many other aspects of MT/DCR protocol implementation (Cotton et al., 2009).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results for Plasma (PLAS):Red Blood Cells (RBC) and Platelets (PLT):RBC (PICO 2)</span></strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with severe trauma, should a high ratio of PLAS:RBC and PLT:RBC versus a low ratio be administered to decrease mortality or total blood products used?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors believe patients in hemorrhagic shock would value rapid reversal of this condition using the most effective resuscitation strategy available. Transfusion therapy for acute hemorrhage has become much safer than ever before with minimal risk of infectious disease transmission or adverse reaction. From a layperson's standpoint, treatment of hemorrhagic shock should involve the replacement of shed blood with products that functionally resemble what has been lost. Thus, the guideline authors believe most patients would value a high-ratio DCR strategy, if not whole blood (which remains Food and Drug Administration and American Association of Blood Banks [AABB] approved) (Kornblith et al., 2014; Spinella et al., 2009; Armand &amp; Hess, 2003).</p>
<p>Based on the available evidence indicating a significant benefit to a high ratio of PLAS:RBC, nine members (82%) voted for a strong recommendation and two (18%) voted for a weak recommendation. Regarding a high ratio of PLT:RBC, eight (73%) voted for a strong recommendation, while three (27%) voted for a conditional recommendation. Thus, the guideline authors recommend targeting a high ratio of both PLAS and PLT:RBC for resuscitating severely injured bleeding trauma patients. Preparing MT packs or pre-positioning blood products in the trauma resuscitation bay in a 1:1:1 ratio (e.g., 6 units PLAS, 1 unit apheresis PLT, and 6 units RBC) can help avoid a significant ratio imbalance during the early empiric resuscitation phase. Additionally, leading with hemostatic PLAS and PLT early and then catching up with RBC in short order seems to be a safe guiding principle (del Junco et al., 2013), although further data are needed in this area.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results for Recombinant Activated Factor VII (rVIIa) (PICO 3) </span></strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with severe trauma, should the hemostatic adjunct rVIIa versus no rVIIa be administered to decrease mortality, total blood products used, or MT? Does use of rVIIa increase rates of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>For most bleeding trauma patients, there does not seem to be a clear, significant mortality benefit from rVIIa. If given early in the resuscitation, rVIIa may decrease the need for a MT. Although there is also no evidence that rVIIa leads to more VTEs, this end point has not been well evaluated in the trauma population. One study in a mixed population of critically ill patients did demonstrate an increased rate of arterial thrombosis with rVIIa administration (Levi et al., 2010). Thus, the guideline authors believe most patients would want these agents given on a selective basis, reserved for those with significant hemorrhage and severe injuries.</p>
<p>The subcommittee was divided on the best recommendation based on this evidence. Four (36%) voted for a weak recommendation for rVIIa, while two (18%) voted against rVIIa (one weak and one strong) and five (45%) felt the data did not support any recommendation for or against rVIIa. Thus, the guideline authors cannot recommend for or against the use of rVIIa in the management of severely injured adult trauma patients. This adjunct does not seem to improve all-cause mortality across all patient populations, and its only demonstrated benefit is a possible reduced need for MT. The guideline authors feel that the use of rVIIa needs further study with particular attention to optimal dosing and the timing of rVIIa relative to blood product administration before a recommendation for or against its use can be made. Furthermore, VTE rates need to be more carefully evaluated with a defined surveillance protocol in future studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Results for Tranexamic Acid (TXA) (PICO 4)</span></strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with severe trauma, should the hemostatic adjunct TXA versus no TXA be administered to decrease mortality, total blood products used, or MT? Does use of TXA increase rates of VTE?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The evidence for in-hospital use of TXA demonstrates a mortality benefit in a mixed population of questionably bleeding trauma patients in one international randomized controlled trial (RCT) (CRASH-2 trial collaborators et al., 2010), on subgroup analysis of a prospectively studied group of severely injured civilian patients in shock (Cole et al., 2015), and on retrospective review of severely injured combat casualties (Morrison et al., 2012; Morrison et al., 2013). When these results are combined, there is no clear universal mortality benefit to TXA; however, the safety profile of this medication seems to be favorable when used early after injury (i.e., within 3 hours). Seven subcommittee members (64%) supported a conditional recommendation for TXA use, while one (9%) favored a strong recommendation and three (27%) felt that a recommendation could not be made for or against TXA use. Thus, the guideline authors conditionally recommend TXA use as a hemostatic adjunct in the management of severely injured adult trauma patients. These recommendations apply only to the use of TXA in a hospital setting pending the results of two ongoing prehospital TXA trials. As with other hemostatic agents, VTE rates need to be more carefully evaluated with the use of a defined surveillance protocol in future studies on TXA.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection of Outcome Measures</span></strong></p>
<p>Relevant outcomes were identified by four authors including mortality, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, total blood products used, need for massive transfusion (MT), and specific complications including multisystem organ failure (MSOF), venous thromboembolic events (VTE) (including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), and transfusion reactions. These outcomes were then scored from 1 (less important) to 9 (critically important) (see table in Supplemental Digital Content 2 [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) and those with a score of 7 or greater were considered. For all Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) questions, mortality and total blood products used were deemed critical. For PICO 3 and 4, additional critical outcomes included need for MT and VTE events.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>For PICO 1, a total of seven retrospective studies assessed the value of an MT or damage control resuscitation (DCR) protocol. One additional study did not define when the MT protocol (MTP) was implemented, while three others described modifications to an existing MT or DCR protocol. Consequently, these four studies were considered in the qualitative analysis only.</p>
<p>For PICO 2, the randomized prospective PROPPR study, two prospective, observational studies, and 12 retrospective studies evaluated plasma (PLAS):red blood cells (RBC) ratios. PROPPR and three retrospective studies evaluated platelets (PLT):RBC ratios. The PROMMTT study used a time-varying analysis that was not conducive to meta-analysis; so it was used for qualitative analysis along with one other study on PLT transfusion.</p>
<p>Hemostatic adjuncts that have been adequately studied for the purposes of this practice management guideline (PMG) include recombinant activated factor VII (rVIIa) and tranexamic acid (TXA). While there is increasing interest in the use of prothrombin complex concentrate, fibrinogen concentrate, and desmopressin in managing acutely bleeding trauma patients, there is currently insufficient evidence to systematically evaluate their use. For PICO 3, two randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled studies and three retrospective studies met inclusion criteria. For PICO 4, tranexamic acid was the subject of a large, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled international trial (CRASH-2) that was included in the analysis. One additional prospective study and the two retrospective Military Application of Tranexamic Acid in Trauma Emergency Resuscitation (MATTERs and MATTERs II) studies were also included. While these military studies contained overlapping patients, only MATTERs reported rates of venous thromboembolic events (VTE), a critical outcome. Thus, MATTERs II was used to assess mortality, blood product use, and MT, while MATTERs was used to evaluate VTE.</p>
<p>One author entered data from each study into Review Manager (RevMan, Cochrane Collaboration, version 5.2) for quantitative analysis. Forest plots were generated for each critical outcome after calculating the random effects relative risk for categorical variables and mean difference for the one continuous variable (blood product use). Mortality was taken as 28-day, 30-day, or hospital mortality according to each study. Detailed blood product use was infrequently reported, although many studies consistently reported units of RBC given in 24 hours. Thus, this was used as a surrogate end point for total blood products. Because RevMan uses mean difference, when a median value was reported, a normal distribution was assumed.</p>
<p>Evidence profiles were generated for each PICO using GRADEpro GDT (GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool, McMaster University, 2015, available at gradepro.org). The guideline authors considered study methodology as well as the domains of study bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias when rating the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low using established methods used by GRADE. Implicit consideration was given to the risks and benefits of each intervention along with the most likely values and preferences of patients the guideline authors have collectively managed in these life-threatening situations. All members of the subcommittee voted on the proposed recommendations for each PICO using Survey Monkey (www. surveymonkey.com) or RedCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Pennsylvania.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Based on this focused analysis, there is compelling evidence that a well-planned massive transfusion (MT)/damage control resuscitation (DCR) protocol will improve survival without increasing blood product usage. A high ratio of plasma (PLAS) and platelet (PLT) to red blood cells (RBC) reduces hemorrhage-related mortality and likely also reduces all-cause mortality, a finding consistent with previous systematic reviews and published guidelines. These benefits may be further augmented by the early in-hospital use of acid (TXA) in severely injured bleeding patients.</p>
<p>Refer to the "Qualitative Synthesis" and "Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-analysis)" sections of the original guideline document for a discussion of evidence related to benefits of specific interventions.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad Hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
    <li>The recommendations in this practice management guideline (PMG) are the result of a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the literature on several aspects of the damage control resuscitation (DCR) paradigm. Although the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach attempts to overcome some limitations of a meta-analysis with a transparent qualitative assessment and evidence evaluation process, these recommendations should not replace clinical judgment. </li>
