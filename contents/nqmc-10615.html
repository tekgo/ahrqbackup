<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Measures in the HEDIS Use of Services domain gather information about how organizations manage the provision of member care and how they use and manage resources. Use of services is affected by many member characteristics, which can vary greatly among organizations, and include age and sex, current medical condition, socioeconomic status and regional practice patterns (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission [MedPAC], 2007).</p>
<p>This measure assesses the extent to which the organization's members receive inpatient hospital treatment because of pregnancy and childbirth, for surgery or for nonsurgical medical treatment.</p>
<p>The organization reports how many hospital stays occurred during the measurement year and the length of hospitalization.</p></div>
