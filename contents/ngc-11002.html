<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assigning a Level of Strength to the Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>When there is sufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms favors the intervention), the author panel assigns one of three recommendation designations: A, B, or C. Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. <strong>Level A</strong> is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb <em>must</em>. <em>Must</em> recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. <strong>Level B</strong> corresponds to the helping verb should. Should recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&ndash;risk profile. Finally, <strong>Level C</strong> corresponds to the helping verb may or might. <em>May</em> and <em>might</em> recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> denotes a practice recommendation that "must" be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level B</strong> indicates a recommendation that "should" be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A <strong>Level C</strong> represents a recommendation that "might" be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a <strong>Level U</strong> or <strong>Level R</strong> designation is appropriate.</p>
<p>A <strong>Level U</strong> indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A <strong>Level R</strong> is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A Level R designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) </li>
        <li>The size of the intervention's effect </li>
        <li>The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) </li>
    <li>The cost of the intervention </li>
    <li>The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In June 2013 and again in June 2015, the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee (GDDI) performed a search of MEDLINE for articles published using the search terms "cerebrovascular disorders" and "etanercept." Search results were filtered through the broad therapeutic clinical query (see appendix e-3 of the online Data Supplement for the specific search strategy employed [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were also searched. A secondary search of the references of selected articles and review articles was performed to identify studies missed by the search strategy.</p>
<p>The titles and abstracts of the identified citations were reviewed for relevance to the clinical question. The full text of potentially relevant articles was retrieved and included in the analysis if the investigators determined functional status in patients with stroke who were treated with etanercept administered by any route. Studies in animals and those with non&ndash;English-language abstracts were excluded from the analysis.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Number of Source Documents
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The search strategy identified 33 citations. Twenty-nine articles were excluded because they were review articles, did not specifically include patents with stroke, or were performed on animals. The full text of 4 potentially relevant articles was reviewed. One of these articles was a review without primary data, and one article was a case report of a patient without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of a stroke. Two articles met inclusion criteria.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Two case series were identified, and both reported clinical improvements 3 weeks following treatment across a wide range of functional domains. However, both studies were rated Class IV because of poor methodologic quality (i.e., high risk of bias). The advisory authors have very low confidence in the evidence for efficacy of etanercept for poststroke disability because of the high risk of bias of the relevant studies. The biological plausibility of benefit was judged to be low because of the reported immediate onset of benefit and single administration of a transiently acting medication. Explanations other than the effectiveness of the treatment for the observed improvements include observer expectation, performance motivation, regression to the mean, and the placebo effect.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Although adverse events of etanercept were not described in the studies reviewed for this practice advisory, serious adverse events are described in studies of patients receiving etanercept for other conditions. Such events include injection site reactions, reactivation of tuberculosis, reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection, congestive heart failure, demyelinating neurologic disorders, vasculitis, and hematologic disorders such as aplastic anemia and pancytopenia. A recent randomized trial of subcutaneous etanercept 50 mg once weekly for 24 weeks for the treatment of Alzheimer disease reported no significant difference in the adverse event rates between patients treated with placebo and patients treated with etanercept. However, the study lacked the statistical precision to exclude uncommon, potentially serious adverse events. It is unclear whether the adverse event profile resulting from the recurrent use of etanercept can be generalized to the time-limited perispinal administration used for the treatment of poststroke disability. Given the limitations of the efficacy of the evidence and the potential for serious adverse events, the advisory authors judged the risk-benefit tradeoffs of etanercept for poststroke disability to be unfavorable.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful practice advisories. Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this practice advisory. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the practice advisories and the developers of the practice advisories. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, practice advisory projects. Drafts of the practice advisory have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.aan.com" title="AAN Web site">www.aan.com</a>.
