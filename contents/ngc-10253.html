<div class="content_para"><p>Staging of this cancer is based on the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obst&eacute;trique (FIGO) Staging. A detailed description of this staging system can be found in the Appendix of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Completely staged, early epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are highly curable. As such, patients should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for adequate staging, including sampling of para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes, infracolic omentectomy, possible appendectomy and biopsy of suspicious peritoneal lesions, in addition to a thorough inspection and palpation of all peritoneal surfaces, and peritoneal washings. </li>
    <li>Advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are best treated with optimal debulking surgery in conjunction with adjuvant therapy. As such, patients should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Staging</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The gold standard for adequate staging includes inspection and palpation of all peritoneal surfaces, peritoneal washings, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling, infracolic omentectomy, possible appendectomy, and biopsy of suspicious lesions and resection of adhesions adjacent to the primary tumour. </li>
    <li>Staging should be ideally performed by a gynecologic oncologist. </li>

<p><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></p>
<p><em>Preferred</em> options include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dose dense</span> intravenous (IV) chemotherapy regimen: carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 5 to 6 IV on day 1) + paclitaxel (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on days 1, 8, 15), q 3 weeks &times; 6 cycles </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intraperitoneal</span> (IP) chemotherapy regimen: day 1: cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IP) + paclitaxel (135 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV); day 8: paclitaxel (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IP), q 3 weeks &times; 6 cycles </li>
    <li>Clinical trials </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Other</em> option:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>IV chemotherapy regimen: carboplatin (AUC 5 to 6 IV) + paclitaxel (175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV), q 3 weeks &times; 6 cycles </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Modifications</em>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>If hypersensitivity to paclitaxel, substitute with docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV). </li>
    <li>If significant toxicity develops, or in medically unfit patients, consider single agent carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 IV) and/or dose reduction at the discretion of the oncologist </li>
    <li>If hypersensitivity to platinum, consider desensitization protocol. </li>
    <li>Note: The use of Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) in this setting is not funded in Alberta at the present time. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Radiotherapy</strong></p>
<p>Consider in select cases to improve local control, at the discretion of the radiation oncologist.</p>
<p><strong>Recurrent Disease</strong></p>
<p>Options include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clinical trials </li>
    <li>Carboplatin +/- paclitaxel </li>
    <li>Carboplatin/liposomal doxorubicin </li>
    <li>Liposomal doxorubicin </li>
    <li>Topotecan </li>
    <li>Cisplatin +/- liposomal doxorubicin </li>
    <li>Also consider: docetaxel, etoposide (oral), gemcitabine, paclitaxel, tamoxifen, or melphalan </li>
    <li>Consider cytoreductive surgery if clinically low volume of focal recurrence followed by clinical trial or platinum-based chemotherapy (below) </li>
</ul>
<p>Recurrence &gt;12 months: consider cytoreductive surgery followed typically by carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up and Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>Follow-up should include a complete history and a pelvic examination as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Years 1 and 2: q 3 to 6 months </li>
    <li>Years 3 through 5: q 6 to 12 months </li>
</ul>
<p>CA-125 blood tests and radiographic scanning have not been proven to be beneficial and are therefore not recommended for routine follow-up.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Trust Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>Following a review of the evidence by the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Team, no major changes were made to the recommendations, with the exception of classifying dose-dense and intraperitoneal chemotherapy as preferred options for chemotherapy. The guideline was otherwise reaffirmed.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it&nbsp;is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
