Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>A-E, L</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations."</p>
<p><strong>Anatomy and Function of the Vulva And Vagina</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The obstetrician and gynaecologist should play an important role in helping women to understand their anatomy and to respect individual variations. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Requests for Vulvo-Vaginal Cosmetic Procedures</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li>For women who present with requests for vaginal cosmetic procedures, a complete medical, sexual, and gynaecologic history should be obtained and the absence of any major sexual or psychological dysfunction should be ascertained. Any possibility of coercion or exploitation should be ruled out. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Counselling should be a priority for women requesting female genital cosmetic surgery. Topics should include normal variation and physiological changes over the lifespan, as well as the possibility of unintended consequences of cosmetic surgery to the genital area. The lack of evidence regarding outcomes and the lack of data on the impact of subsequent changes during pregnancy or menopause should also be discussed and considered part of the informed consent process. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is little evidence to support any of the female genital cosmetic surgeries in terms of improvement to sexual satisfaction or self-image. Physicians choosing to proceed with these cosmetic procedures should not promote these surgeries for the enhancement of sexual function and advertising of female genital cosmetic surgical procedures should be avoided. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Requests for Vulvo-Vaginal Cosmetic Procedures in Adolescents</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>Physicians who see adolescents requesting female genital cosmetic surgery require additional expertise in counselling adolescents. Such procedures should not be offered until complete maturity including genital maturity, and parental consent is not required at that time. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li>Non-medical terms, including but not restricted to vaginal rejuvenation, clitoral resurfacing, and G-spot enhancement, should be recognized as marketing terms only, with no medical origin; therefore they cannot be scientifically evaluated. (<strong>III-L</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence Assessment*</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly randomized controlled trial</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence from well-designed cohort (prospective or retrospective) or case-control studies, preferably from more than one centre or research group</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from comparisons between times or places with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the results of treatment with penicillin in the 1940s) could also be included in this category.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p class="Note">*Adapted from the Evaluation of Evidence criteria described in the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations&dagger;</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. There is good evidence to recommend the clinical preventive action.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>. There is fair evidence to recommend the clinical preventive action.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>. The existing evidence is conflicting and does not allow to make a recommendation for or against use of the clinical preventive action; however, other factors may influence decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>. There is fair evidence to recommend against the clinical preventive action.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>. There is good evidence to recommend against the clinical preventive action.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong>. There is insufficient evidence (in quantity or quality) to make a recommendation; however, other factors may influence decision-making.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed or MEDLINE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library in 2011 and 2012 using appropriate controlled vocabulary and key words (female genital cosmetic surgery). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to May 2012. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.</p></div>
