<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Diabetes is a complex group of diseases marked by high blood sugar due to the body's inability to make or use insulin. Diabetes can lead to serious complications (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014) Twenty-nine million (9.3 percent) of Americans had diabetes in 2012 and 1.7 million adults were newly diagnosed with diabetes (American Diabetes Association [ADA], 2014). Patients with diabetes have elevated cardiovascular risk, thought to be due in part to elevations in unhealthy cholesterol levels. Having unhealthy cholesterol levels places patients at a significant risk for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (ADA, 2015).</p>
<p>Primary prevention for cardiovascular disease is an important aspect of diabetes management. The risk of an adult with diabetes developing cardiovascular disease is two to four times higher than that of an adult without diabetes (American Heart Association [AHA], 2012). In addition to being at a higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease, patients with diabetes tend to have worse survival after the onset of cardiovascular disease (Stone et al., 2014). The CDC estimates that adults with diabetes are 1.7 times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than adults without diabetes (CDC, 2014).</p>
<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk. The use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes, based on their age and other risk factors, is recommended by guidelines from the ADA (2015) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) (Stone et al., 2014). </p>
<p>Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are a class of drugs that decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Statins can decrease LDL-C levels by as much as 50% and could have additional benefit on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride levels (Spratt, 2009). The amount of cholesterol lowering effect is based on statin intensity, which is classified as either high, moderate or low intensity.</p>
<p>Cholesterol lowering medications, such as statins, are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in America, accumulating $17 billion in sales in 2012. In the United States, 22 percent of adults (45 and older) take statins (CDC, 2014). Evidence shows statin use decreases cardiovascular mortality in patients with established cardiovascular disease, and total mortality rates. Primary and secondary prevention trial data strongly support starting lipid-lowering therapy with a statin in most patients with type 2 diabetes (Spratt, 2009).</p>
<p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies conducted to evaluate the clinical benefit of lipid-lowering drug treatment in primary and secondary prevention, researchers found statins were equally effective in patients with and without diabetes (Costa et al., 2006). However, after adjusting for baseline risk, patients with diabetes had greater benefit in both the primary and secondary prevention of death due to coronary artery disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization and stroke. Another meta-analysis by the American College of Physicians on lipid-lowering therapy for type 2 diabetes patients found a 22 percent reduction of cardiovascular events with primary prevention and a 24 percent reduction for secondary prevention (Spratt, 2009).</p>
<p>The total cost of diabetes care in the United States was $245 billion in 2012&mdash;a 41 percent increase from $175 billion in 2007. The cost of care to treat patients with diabetes includes direct costs ($176 billion) from office visits, hospital care and medications. Indirect costs to treat patients with diabetes are estimated to be $69 billion and includes costs for absenteeism, reduced productivity, unemployment due to disability and loss of productivity due to premature mortality. Research also shows that more than 1 in 10 dollars spent on health care in the United States are spent on the care of patients with diabetes and its complications (ADA, 2013).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline recommendations</strong>: ACC/AHA. For men and women 40 to 75 years of age with a diagnosis of diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended. For men and women age 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, high-intensity statin therapy should be used unless contraindicated. For men and women under 40 years of age or over 75 years of age with a diagnosis of diabetes, it is reasonable to initiate or continue statin therapy for those who are tolerating it, provided that benefits, potential risks, drug interactions and patient preferences are taken into consideration (Stone et al., 2014). </p>
<p>ADA. For men and women 40 to 75 years of age with a diagnosis of diabetes but without any cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, consider using moderate-intensity stain and lifestyle therapy. For men and women of all ages with a diagnosis of diabetes and CVD risk factors, moderate or high-intensity statin therapy is recommended (2015). </p></div>
