Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the Levels of Certainty regarding Net Benefit (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Recommendation and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends that all women who are planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400-800 &mu;g) of folic acid (<strong>A recommendation</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population Under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to women who are planning or capable of pregnancy (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document). It does not apply to women who have had a previous pregnancy affected by neural tube defects or who are at very high risk due to other factors (e.g., use of certain antiseizure medications or family history). These women may be advised to take higher doses of folic acid.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>
<p>Although all women of childbearing age are at risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects and should take folic acid supplementation, some factors increase their risk, including a personal or family history (first- or second-degree relative) of neural tube defects. Women with a personal history of an affected pregnancy require special care and are not within the scope of this recommendation statement. Other risk factors include the use of particular antiseizure medications (e.g., valproic acid or carbamazepine), maternal diabetes, obesity, and mutations in folate-related enzymes.</p>
<p>Questions persist regarding increased risk of neural tube defects in some racial/ethnic groups. Birth prevalence rates are highest among Hispanic women, followed by non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women. Genetic mutations in folate-related enzymes may vary by race/ethnicity. Dietary folate or folic acid intake differs by race/ethnicity. For example, Mexican American women may be at increased risk because of decreased consumption of fortified foods and greater intake of corn masa&ndash;based diets. Fewer Hispanic women (28%) report consuming 0.4 mg (400 &mu;g) or more of folic acid daily through fortified food or supplements, compared with 39% of non-Hispanic white women.</p>
<p><strong>Timing</strong></p>
<p>Half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned. Therefore, clinicians should advise all women who are capable of pregnancy to take daily folic acid supplements. The critical period for supplementation starts at least 1 month before conception and continues through the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Dosage</strong></p>
<p>Trials and observational studies conducted in settings without food fortification suggest that supplementation with a multivitamin containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400-800 &mu;g) of folic acid decreases the risk of neural tube defects. Evidence shows that most women in the United States are not consuming fortified foods in a quantity needed to demonstrate optimal benefit. An analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data found that 48% of respondents of childbearing age consumed the recommended amount of folic acid from mandatorily fortified foods only.</p>
<p>According to the National Academy of Sciences Food and Nutrition Board, the tolerable upper intake level of folic acid in women 19 years and older is 1 mg/d (1000 &mu;g/d) from supplements or fortified food (excluding naturally occurring folate) and 0.8 mg/d (800 &mu;g/d) for those aged 14 to 18 years. Fewer than 3% of girls and women aged 14 to 50 years receive more than 1 mg/d (1000 &mu;g/d) of folic acid from supplements or food.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends community-wide education campaigns to encourage women of childbearing age to take folic acid supplements.</p>
<p>In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved folic acid fortification of corn masa flour. This allows manufacturers to voluntarily add folic acid to corn masa flour at levels consistent with those found in other enriched cereal grains.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The USPSTF defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: A systematic review of the literature was prepared by the RTI International&ndash;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) for use by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Sources and Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>The investigators searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE for English-language articles published from database inception through January 28, 2016. The search strategies for these databases are listed in the eMethods in the systematic review supplement. Unpublished literature was searched for in ClinicalTrials.gov, HSRProj (Health Services Research Projects in Progress), the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Reporter. To supplement electronic searches, the reference lists of pertinent articles and all suggested citations from peer reviewers were reviewed. Ongoing surveillance was conducted after January 2016 through article alerts and targeted searches of high-impact journals to identify major studies published in the interim that may affect the conclusions or understanding of the evidence and therefore the related USPSTF recommendation. The last surveillance was conducted on November 11, 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles using prespecified inclusion criteria for each Key Question (KQ) (see eTable 1 in the systematic review supplement).</p>
<p>Studies were included if they focused on the use of folic acid supplementation for the prevention of neural tube defect (NTD)-affected pregnancies in women of childbearing age. Not included were studies of prepubertal girls or men or women without the potential for childbearing (e.g., postmenopausal, genetic, uterine, or ovarian abnormalities). The investigators searched for studies that examined the use of folic acid supplementation with or without food fortification or naturally occurring folate for the prevention of NTDs. They also searched for studies that examined the supplementation of micronutrients (e.g., multivitamin, iron) in combination with folic acid for the prevention of NTDs. For all KQs, they searched for studies conducted in the United States or in countries rated "very high" on the United Nations Human Development Index.</p>
<p>Studies were included that compared interventions with placebo, no treatment, dietary supplementation only, supplementation with prenatal vitamins without folic acid, or iron supplements without folic acid for questions on benefits and harms and variations in subpopulations (KQs 1a, 1b, and 2a). Included studies compared interventions with lower or higher dose of folic acid supplementation only for questions about variations in benefits and harms by dosage (KQs 1b, 1c, and 2b).</p>
<p>Studies were sought that reported on the benefits of folic acid supplementation initiated before the index pregnancy or in the first trimester to prevent NTDs for questions on benefits and variation in benefits in subpopulations (KQs 1a and 1b). The timing of the intervention was expanded through the end of the pregnancy for questions on the effect of timing on benefits or any harms questions (KQs 1c, 2a, and 2b).</p>
<p>For benefits and harms (KQs 1 and 2), randomized clinical trials (RCTs), nonrandomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and systematic reviews were included. Additionally, for harms (KQs 2a and 2b), registry data were included. Two reviewers dually reviewed the quality of all studies included in the 2009 report that met the inclusion criteria for the current review and resolved disagreement by discussion and consensus.</p></div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>For each included study, one investigator extracted information about methods, patient population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, setting, and study design, and a second investigator reviewed for completeness and accuracy. Two independent investigators assessed the quality of each study as good, fair, or poor, using predefined criteria developed by the USPSTF and adapted for this topic (see eTables 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the systematic review supplement).</p>
<p>Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. Issues leading to a judgment of poor quality included the risk of misclassification bias from retrospective recall of level and timing of exposure; the risk of selection bias from not identifying all cases of the outcome, including fetal deaths; and the risk of confounding from not appropriately accounting for factors such as infertility that might influence both exposure to folic acid supplementation and the outcome of twinning. Studies with 1 or more of these features were rated as poor quality. Other flaws that resulted in poor-quality ratings included initially assembled groups not close to being comparable or maintained throughout the study (including overall attrition of at least 20% or differential attrition of at least 15% between groups); use of unreliable or invalid measurement instruments or unequal application among groups (including not masking outcome assessment); and, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the lack of intention-to-treat analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Findings for each Key Question were qualitatively synthesized by summarizing the characteristics and results of included studies in tabular or narrative format. To determine whether meta-analyses were appropriate, the clinical and methodological heterogeneity (in population, interventions, and outcomes) of the studies were assessed following established guidance.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) systematically reviews the evidence concerning both the benefits and harms of widespread implementation of a preventive service. It then assesses the certainty of the evidence and the magnitude of the benefits and harms. On the basis of this assessment, the USPSTF assigns a letter grade to each preventive service signifying its recommendation about provision of the service (see table below). An important, but often challenging, step is determining the balance between benefits and harms to estimate "net benefit" (that is, benefits minus harms).</p>

<p class="Note">*<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group "invited for screening" and the group "not invited for screening."</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the Task Force constructs a "chain of evidence" within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term <em>certainty</em> will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as "high" certainty (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as "moderate" certainty. Certainty is "low" when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peer Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) send the draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. The draft evidence review is also posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response to Public Comment</span></strong></p>
<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from May 10 to June 6, 2016. Some comments requested a more detailed definition of "excessive" folic acid. In response, the USPSTF added information about tolerable upper intake levels for folic acid. Other comments suggested emphasizing that many women do not meet daily recommended amounts of folic acid and adding language on the potential harms of folic acid supplementation. The USPSTF added language about the harms of supplementation and the difficulty of consuming enough folic acid from food alone.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comparison with Guidelines from Other Groups</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations for screening from the following groups were discussed: the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies (formerly the Institute of Medicine), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of Family Physicians, the U.S. Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/" title="USPSTF Web site">Web site</a>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size <em>Guide to Clinical Preventive Services</em>.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div>
