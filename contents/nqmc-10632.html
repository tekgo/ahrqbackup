<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 120 million people (Murray et al., 2012). The lifelong prevalence is estimated to range from 10 to 15 percent (L&eacute;pine &amp; Briley, 2011). In the United States (U.S.), 15.7 percent of people report that at some point in their lifetime they were told by a health care professional that they had depression (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009). </p>
<p>Depression is also associated with other chronic medical conditions and increased morbidity and mortality. The mortality risk for suicide in depressed patients is more than 20-fold greater than in the general population (Bostwick &amp; Pankratz, 2000). In terms of other chronic conditions, depression is associated with a 60 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes (Mezuk et al., 2008) and has been identified as a risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease (Van der Kooy et al., 2007).</p>
<p>In adolescents, depression can also result in serious long-term morbidities such as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder or lead to engagement in risky behaviors such as substance use (Taylor et al., 1996; Foley, Carlton, &amp; Howell, 1996; Friedman et al., 1996). Adolescent-onset depression increases the risk of attempted suicide by five-fold, compared with nondepressed adolescents (Garber et al., 2009). Most adolescents who commit suicide - the third leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds - have a previous history of depression (Williams et al., 2009). </p>
<p>Depression has large effects on both health care costs and lost productivity. Adolescents with depression have higher medical expenditures, including those related to general and mental health care, than adolescents without a diagnosis of depression (O'Connor et al., 2009). A recent study showed a relationship between the severity of depression symptoms and work function in working-age adults, and found that for every 1-point increase in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score (a measure of depression severity), patients experienced an additional mean productivity loss of 1.65 percent. In a survey study, Birnbaum et al. (2010) found that major depressive disorder severity is significantly associated with increased treatment usage and costs, unemployment, disability and reduced work performance. When the results of the study were projected to the U.S. workforce, it was estimated that monthly depression-related worker productivity losses had human capital costs of nearly $2 billion.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have found that patient outcomes improve when there is collaboration between a primary care doctor, case manager and a mental health specialist to screen for depression, monitor symptoms, provide treatment and refer to specialty care as needed (Von Korff &amp; Goldberg, 2001; Gilbody et al., 2006; Thota et al., 2012; Katon &amp; Seelig, 2008; Un&uuml;tzer et al., 2002). Standardized instruments are useful in identifying meaningful change in clinical outcomes over time. Guidelines recommend that providers establish and maintain regular follow-up with patients diagnosed with depression and use a standardized tool to track symptoms (Mitchell et al., 2013; Cheung et al., 2007).</p></div>
