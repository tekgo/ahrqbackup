Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed or MEDLINE in 2013 using controlled vocabulary and key words (e.g., MRI, safety, pregnancy). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English and in French. There were no date restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to July 2013. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.</p></div>

Potential Benefits

<div class="content_para"><p>Appropriate and safe use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the obstetrical patient</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Maternal risks associated with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the same as for non-pregnant patients. One safety consideration for the obstetrical patient is prolonged supine positioning. A gravid uterus of significant size can lead to hypotension due to compression of the inferior vena cava. This can be avoided by placing the patient in a lateral oblique or lateral decubitus position. </li>
    <li>Theoretical fetal concerns include teratogenic and biological effects. It is known that MRI may cause effects at the cellular level from the induction of local electric fields, currents from static and time-varying magnetic fields, and tissue and cellular heating from radiofrequency (RF) fields. </li>
    <li>To date there is insufficient evidence to understand the true risks of first trimester exposure to the developing fetus. Until these theoretical concerns can be appropriately addressed, the guideline developers advocate a cautious approach to using obstetrical MRI in the first trimester. </li>
    <li>Gadolinium crosses the placenta and is excreted by the fetal kidneys into the amniotic fluid, where it remains, exposing the developing fetus, particularly the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, for an extended period of time. The risks and benefits of gadolinium use must be discussed with the pregnant patient and referring clinician. Despite animal data and concerns about the use of gadolinium in pregnancy, there have been no reported adverse human fetal effects. However, many authors remain cautious about the use of gadolinium at any time in pregnancy. </li>
    <li>Obstetrical MRI can be technically challenging to perform and interpret given the movement of the fetus and its variable lie and presentation. The imaging protocol must be altered when the fetus moves or if new anomalies are detected in the course of the scan. </li>
    <li>Slice thickness between 2.5 and 5 mm is used in examining most fetal structures. Thinner slices are possible but have adverse effects on signal-to-noise ratio. At present, the minimum voxel size that may be obtained with fetal MRI is 0.8 &times; 0.8 &times; 2.5 mm, with slice thickness and fetal&ndash;maternal movement the major limiting factors. These factors decrease resolution and may obscure structures smaller than 1 mm and create difficulties in accurately measuring small or thin structures. </li>
</ul>
