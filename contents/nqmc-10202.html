<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The "probably benign" assessment category is reserved for findings that have a high probability (greater than or equal to 98%) chance of being benign and should not be used as a category for indeterminate findings. Inappropriate designation of findings as "probably benign" can result in unnecessary follow-up of lesions that could have been quickly classified or delayed diagnosis and treatment of cancerous lesions (Kerlikowske et al., 2005). Published guidance documents (American College of Radiology [ACR], 2013; D'Orsi et al., 2003) emphasize the need to conduct a complete diagnostic imaging evaluation before making a probably benign (Category 3) assessment; making it inadvisable to use the probably benign categorization when interpreting a screening mammogram. Immediate completion of a diagnostic imaging evaluation for abnormal screening mammograms eliminates potential anxiety that women would endure with the short interval follow-up that is recommended for "probably benign" findings.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>A category 3, 4, or 5 assessment is not recommended for a screening mammogram, even though in some instances a highly suspicious abnormality may be identified that will warrant a recommendation for biopsy. Rather, all patients with screening abnormalities should be given a BI-RADS&reg; category 0 assessment and recalled for further diagnostic studies (ACR, 2013).</p>
<p>All the previously cited studies emphasize the need to conduct a complete diagnostic imaging evaluation before making a probably benign (category 3) assessment; hence it is recommended not to render such an assessment in interpreting a screening mammography examination. The practice of rendering category 3 assessments directly from screening examination also has been shown to result in adverse outcomes: 1) unnecessary follow-up of many lesions that could have been promptly assessed as benign, and 2) delayed diagnosis of a small number of cancers that otherwise may have been smaller in size and less likely to be advanced in stage (ACR, 2013; D'Orsi et al., 2003).</p>
<p>The use of assessment category 3, probably benign, has been clarified in the lexicon of the 2013 edition. It is emphasized that this is <strong><em>not</em></strong> an indeterminate category used simply when the radiologist is unsure whether the render a benign (BI-RADS&reg; category 2) or suspicious (BI-RADS&reg; category 4) assessment, but one that is reserved for specific imaging findings known to have a greater than essentially 0% but less than or equal to 2% likelihood of representing malignancy (ACR, 2013; D'Orsi et al., 2003).</p>
<p>For mammography, there is robust literature describing three findings (noncalcified circumscribed solid mass, focal asymmetry and solitary group of punctate calcifications) that have likelihoods of malignancy in the defined (less than or equal to 2%) probably benign range, for which short interval (6-month) follow-up mammography and then periodic mammographic surveillance represents appropriate management (ACR, 2013; D'Orsi et al., 2003; Kerlikowske et al., 2005; Baum et al., 2011). Use of assessment category 3 for mammographic findings other than these three should be considered only if the radiologist has personal experience to justify a watchful-waiting approach, preferably involving observation of a sufficient number of cases of an additional mammographic finding to suggest a likelihood of malignancy within the defined (less than or equal to 2%) probably-benign range. Two large-scale studies performed in the United States have validated that in the usual-care setting, category 3 assessments indeed are associated with a likelihood of malignancy of less than or equal to 2% (ACR, 2013; D'Orsi et al., 2003).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
As imaging technology continues to advance, the United States healthcare system has seen an increase in both the type and frequency of imaging studies being performed. The increase in utilization of imaging studies is accompanied by a corresponding increase in cost and exposure to radiation for both patients and healthcare professionals. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the number of radiologic procedures performed in the United States showed a ten-fold increase while the annual per-capita effective dose from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures increased by 600% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, the number of computerized tomographic (CT) examinations tripled, while the number of ultrasounds nearly doubled (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine, and ultrasound) accounted for approximately 35% of all imaging studies (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the proportion of radiation exposure that is attributable to medical sources increased from 17% to 53% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, while CT scans only accounted for approximately 17% of all radiologic procedures performed in the United States, they accounted for over 65% of the total effective radiation dose from radiologic procedures (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, the estimated per-capita effective radiation dose for radiologic procedures in the United States was nearly 20% higher than the average for other well-developed countries (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic imaging was prioritized as a topic area for measure development due to a high level of utilization, rising costs, and the need for measures to help promote appropriate use of imaging and improve outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
Although a mammogram assessment category of "probably benign" is not recommended for use in interpreting screening mammograms, it is associated with approximately 2.3% of screening mammograms (Baum et al., 2011). Additionally, compliance is shown to be poor among women referred to short-interval follow-up (Baum et al., 2011). </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a measure testing project in 2011 with Telligen to ensure four radiology measures were reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator, and exception case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing electronic health record data and claims data. Inter-rater reliability was tested. Three sites in three states participated in the testing of the measures. All three sites were in urban settings. Site A was a group practice with 10 physicians. Site B was a hospital-based group practice with 90 physicians. Site C was a hospital-based practice with greater than 1000 physicians.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong><br />
The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from chart records were used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the measures. </p>
<p>Some of the measures in this set are being made available without any prior testing. The PCPI recognizes the importance of testing all of its measures and encourages testing of the diagnostic imaging measurement set for feasibility and reliability by organizations or individuals positioned to do so. The <em>Measure Testing Protocol for PCPI Measures</em> was approved by the PCPI in 2010 and is available on the PCPI Web site (see Position Papers at <a href="http://www.physicianconsortium.org" title="PCPI Web site">www.physicianconsortium.org</a>); interested parties are encouraged to review this document and to contact PCPI staff. The PCPI will welcome any opportunity to promote the initial testing of these measures and to ensure that any results available from testing are used to refine the measures before implementation. </p></div>
