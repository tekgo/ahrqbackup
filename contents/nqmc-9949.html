Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of women 67 to 85 years of age who suffered a fracture and who had either a bone mineral density (BMD) test or prescription for a drug to treat osteoporosis in the six months after the fracture.</p>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength that puts a person at increased risk for fractures. Morbidity and mortality related to osteoporotic fractures are a major health issue. Ten million Americans have osteoporosis, and another 18 million are at risk for osteoporosis due to low bone mass (National Institutes of Health [NIH] Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis Prevention, Diagnosis, and Therapy, 2001). Eighty percent of people with osteoporosis are women (NIH Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis Prevention, Diagnosis, and Therapy, 2001). Women who suffer a fracture are at increased risk of suffering additional fractures. </p>
<p>Treatment of osteoporotic fractures is estimated at $10 to $15 billion annually in the United States (U.S). In 1995, osteoporotic fractures caused 432,000 hospital admissions, 2.5 million physician visits and 180,000 nursing home admissions. The aging U.S. population is likely to increase the future financial cost of osteoporosis care. </p>
<p>One study showed that less than 5 percent of patients with osteoporotic fractures are referred for medical evaluation and treatment (NIH Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis Prevention, Diagnosis, and Therapy, 2001). Another retrospective study of over 1,000 postmenopausal women who sustained a fracture of the distal radius found that only 24 percent received either a diagnostic evaluation or treatment for the condition (Stephen &amp; Wallace, 2001).</p></div>

Once NCQA establishes national benchmarks for accountable care organization (ACO) performance, all measures will undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomiol statistical analysis. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test.</p></div>
