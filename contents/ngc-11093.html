Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Levels of evidence (<strong>I&ndash;V</strong>) and grades of recommendation (<strong>A&ndash;F</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: These recommendations and clinical practice guidelines are based on the scientific literature published prior to January 2013.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk Factors</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should assess the presence of limited ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, high body mass index in nonathletic individuals, running, and work-related weight-bearing activities&mdash;particularly under conditions with poor shock absorption&mdash;as risk factors for the development of heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis/Classification</span></strong></p>
<p>Physical therapists should diagnose the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) category of plantar fasciitis and the associated International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) impairment-based category of heel pain (<strong>b28015 Pain in lower limb</strong>, <strong>b2804 Radiating pain in a segment or region</strong>) using the following history and physical examination findings:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Plantar medial heel pain: most noticeable with initial steps after a period of inactivity but also worse following prolonged weight bearing </li>
    <li>Heel pain precipitated by a recent increase in weight-bearing activity </li>
    <li>Pain with palpation of the proximal insertion of the plantar fascia </li>
    <li>Positive windlass test </li>
    <li>Negative tarsal tunnel tests </li>
    <li>Limited active and passive talocrural joint dorsiflexion range of motion </li>
    <li>Abnormal Foot Posture Index score </li>
    <li>High body mass index in nonathletic individuals </li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Differential Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should assess for diagnostic classifications other than heel pain/plantar fasciitis, including spondyloarthritis, fat-pad atrophy, and proximal plantar fibroma, when the individual&rsquo;s reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the Diagnosis/Classification section of the original guideline document, or when the individual's symptoms are not resolving with interventions aimed at normalization of the individual's impairments of body function. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examination</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ), or the Foot Function Index (FFI) and may use the computer-adaptive version of the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) as validated self-report questionnaires before and after interventions intended to alleviate the physical impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions associated with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Activity Limitation and Participation Restriction Measures</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should utilize easily reproducible performance-based measures of activity limitation and participation restriction measures to assess changes in the patient's level of function associated with heel pain/plantar fasciitis over the episode of care. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: F</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Physical Impairment Measures</strong></p>
<p>When evaluating a patient with heel pain/plantar fasciitis over an episode of care, assessment of impairment of body function should include measures of pain with initial steps after a period of inactivity and pain with palpation of the proximal insertion of the plantar fascia, and may include measures of active and passive ankle dorsiflexion range of motion and body mass index in nonathletic individuals. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interventions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Manual Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use manual therapy, consisting of joint and soft tissue mobilization, procedures to treat relevant lower extremity joint mobility and calf flexibility deficits and to decrease pain and improve function in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Stretching</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use plantar fascia&ndash;specific and gastrocnemius/soleus stretching to provide short-term (1 week to 4 months) pain relief for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. Heel pads may be used to increase the benefits of stretching. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Taping</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use antipronation taping for immediate (up to 3 weeks) pain reduction and improved function for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. Additionally, clinicians may use elastic therapeutic tape applied to the gastrocnemius and plantar fascia for short-term (1 week) pain reduction. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Foot Orthoses</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use foot orthoses, either prefabricated or custom fabricated/fitted, to support the medial longitudinal arch and cushion the heel in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis to reduce pain and improve function for short- (2 weeks) to long-term (1 year) periods, especially in those individuals who respond positively to antipronation taping techniques. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Night Splints</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should prescribe a 1- to 3-month program of night splints for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis who consistently have pain with the first step in the morning. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Physical Agents</strong></p>
<p><em>Electrotherapy</em></p>
<p>Clinicians should use manual therapy, stretching, and foot orthoses instead of electrotherapeutic modalities, to promote intermediate and long-term (1-6 months) improvements in clinical outcomes for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. Clinicians may or may not use iontophoresis with dexamethasone or acetic acid to provide short-term (2-4 weeks) pain relief and improved function. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: D</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Low-Level Laser</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may use low-level laser therapy to reduce pain and activity limitations in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Phonophoresis</em></p>
<p>Clinicians may use phonophoresis with ketoprofen gel to reduce pain in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Ultrasound</em></p>
<p>The use of ultrasound cannot be recommended for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Footwear</strong></p>
<p>To reduce pain in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis, clinicians may prescribe (1) a rocker-bottom shoe construction in conjunction with a foot orthosis, and (2) shoe rotation during the work week for those who stand for long periods. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Education and Counseling for Weight Loss</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may provide education and counseling on exercise strategies to gain or maintain optimal lean body mass in individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. Clinicians may also refer individuals to an appropriate health care practitioner to address nutrition issues. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: E</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Exercise and Neuromuscular Re-education</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may prescribe strengthening exercises and movement training for muscles that control pronation and attenuate forces during weight-bearing activities. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: F</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Dry Needling</strong></p>
<p>The use of trigger point dry needling cannot be recommended for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Levels of Evidence</strong></p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The authors of this guideline revision worked with research librarians with expertise in systematic review to perform a systematic search for concepts associated with heel pain or plantar fasciitis in articles published since 2007 related to classification, examination, and intervention strategies for heel pain or plantar fasciitis, consistent with previous guideline development methods related to International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) classification. Briefly, the following databases were searched from 2007 to between December 13 and 19, 2012: MEDLINE (PubMed) (2007 to date), Cochrane Library (2007 to date), Web of Science (2007 to date), CINAHL (2007 to date), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (2007 to date), PEDro (2007 to date), and ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source (2007 to date). See Appendix A and Appendix B in the original guideline document for full search strategies and search dates and results, respectively.</p>
<p>Articles contributing to recommendations were reviewed based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Appendix C in the original guideline document), with the goal of identifying evidence relevant to physical therapist clinical decision making for adult persons with heel pain/plantar fasciitis. The title and abstract of each article were reviewed independently by 2 members of the clinical practice guideline (CPG) development team for inclusion. Full-text review was then similarly conducted to obtain the final set of articles for contribution to recommendations. The team leader provided the final decision for discrepancies that were not resolved by the review team. See Appendix D for a flow chart of articles and Appendix E for articles included in recommendations by topic (see the original guideline document for appendices). For selected relevant topics that were not appropriate for the development of recommendations, such as shockwave therapy, injection, and imaging, articles were not subject to the systematic review process and were not included in the flow chart.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Content experts were appointed by the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) to conduct a review of the literature and to develop an updated heel pain/plantar fasciitis clinical practice guideline (CPG) as indicated by the current state of the evidence in the field. The aims of the revision were to provide a concise summary of the evidence since publication of the original guideline and to develop new recommendations or revise previously published recommendations to support evidence-based practice.</p>
<p>The strength of the evidence supporting the recommendations was graded according to the previously established methods for the original guideline and those provided in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field. Each team developed recommendations based on the strength of evidence, including how directly the studies addressed the question and heel pain/plantar fasciitis population. In developing their recommendations, the authors considered the strengths and limitations of the body of evidence and the health benefits, side effects, and risks of tests and interventions.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Treatment directed to reducing plantar fascia strain has been shown to be effective in reducing pain with initial steps and palpation of the proximal insertion of the plantar fascia. </li>
    <li>A randomized clinical trial found that soft tissue mobilization techniques directed to the musculature of the lower leg were associated with improved disability and pressure pain threshold measurements in individuals with plantar heel pain. </li>
    <li>In patients with plantar fasciitis, antipronation (low-Dye) taping was found to reduce pain and improve function over a 3-week period. Also, antipronation taping (augmented low-Dye) produced an immediate decrease in mean walking plantar pressure and pain when walking and jogging. </li>
    <li>One study found prefabricated semi-rigid foot orthoses to have a moderately beneficial effect compared to sham foot orthoses in reducing pain and improving function over a 3- to 12-month period in individuals with plantar fasciitis compared with the controls. Another study reported that both prefabricated and custom orthoses were useful in distributing rearfoot pressure, whereas heel pads increased rearfoot pressure. </li>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>One review of calf muscle and/or plantar fascia&ndash;specific stretching included a study that noted adverse effects, which included increased pain in the heel, calf, and other areas of the lower limb, in 10 of 46 participants within the calf stretching group. </li>
    <li>Potential harms associated with intralesional corticosteroid injection (ICSI) may include injection-site pain, infection, subcutaneous fat atrophy, skin pigmentation changes, plantar fascia rupture, peripheral nerve injury, and muscle damage. </li>
</ul>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>These guidelines are not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of medical care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made based on clinical experience and expertise in light of the clinical presentation of the patient; the available evidence; the available diagnostic and treatment options; and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences. However, it is suggested that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in the patient's medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.</p></div>
