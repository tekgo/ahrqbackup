Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Each practice recommendation is rated based on the strength of the evidence.  Definitions of the strength of the recommendations (standard, guideline, practice option, practice advisory) and quality of the evidence (Class I-Class III) are presented at the end of the Major Recommendations field.</p>

<P><strong>Conclusions</strong></P>

<P>After systematically reviewing the controlled but nonrandomized studies describing outcomes in myasthenia gravis patients undergoing and not undergoing thymectomy the authors found:</P>

<OL>
<LI>positive associations in most studies between 
  thymectomy and myasthenia gravis remission and improvement (median relative 
  rate of medication-free remission, 2.1; asymptomatic, 1.6; improvement, 1.7) 
  
<LI>confounding differences in baseline characteristics of 
  prognostic importance between thymectomy and nonthymectomy patient groups in 
  all studies
  
<LI>persistent positive associations between thymectomy and 
  improved myasthenia gravis outcomes after controlling for single confounding 
  variables such as age, gender, and severity of myasthenia gravis
  
<LI>conflicting associations between thymectomy and improved myasthenia gravis outcomes in studies controlling for multiple confounding variables simultaneously</LI></OL>

<P>The authors cannot determine from the available studies whether the observed association between thymectomy and improved myasthenia gravis outcome was a result of a thymectomy benefit or was merely a result of the multiple differences in baseline characteristics between the surgical and nonsurgical groups. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the benefit of thymectomy in non-thymomatous autoimmune myasthenia gravis has not been established conclusively.</P>

<P><strong>Practice Recommendation</strong></P>

<P>For patients with nonthymomatous autoimmune myasthenia gravis, thymectomy is recommended as an <em>option</em> to increase the probability of remission or improvement (Class II).</P>

<P><strong><U>Definitions</U></strong>:</P>

<P><strong>Classification of Evidence</strong></P>

<P><strong>Class I</strong>: Evidence provided by one or more well-designed randomized controlled trials, including overviews (meta-analyses) of such trials.</P>

<P><strong>Class II</strong>: Evidence provided by well-designed observational studies with concurrent controls (e.g., case–control and cohort studies).</P>

<P><strong>Class III</strong>: Evidence provided by expert opinion, case series, and studies with historical controls.</P>

<P><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></P>

<P><strong>Standards</strong>: A principle for patient management that reflects a high degree of clinical certainty (usually this requires Class I evidence that directly addresses the clinical question or overwhelming Class II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials).</P>

<P><strong>Guidelines</strong>: A recommendation for patient management that reflects moderate clinical certainty (usually this requires Class II evidence or a strong consensus of Class III evidence). </P>

<P><strong>Practice option</strong>: A strategy for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion).</P>

<P><strong>Practice advisory</strong>: A practice recommendation for emerging and/or newly approved therapies or technologies based on evidence from at least one Class I study. The evidence may demonstrate only a modest statistical effect or limited (partial) clinical response, or notable cost–benefit questions may exist. Substantial (or potential) disagreement among practitioners or between payers and practitioners may exist.</P></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Original Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The authors searched the National Library of Medicine's Medline database from 1966 to February 1998 using the medical subject headings "myasthenia gravis" (restricted to the surgery subheading) and "thymectomy". To identify articles published before 1966, or missed by our original search strategy, we reviewed the references of the identified articles.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2014 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>Medline was searched from 2010 July 10 to 2014 August 9 for the terms &ldquo;myasthenia gravis&rdquo; and &ldquo;thymectomy.&rdquo; The included controlled studies described outcomes in myasthenia gravis patients treated with and without thymectomy. Class III (uncontrolled case studies) and patients with thymomas were excluded from the analysis.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Within a given controlled (Class II) study, the authors describe the therapeutic effect of thymectomy by comparing the rate myasthenia gravis patients receiving thymectomy achieved desirable outcomes with the rate myasthenia gravis patients not receiving thymectomy achieved desirable outcomes. The nonrandomized nature of Class II studies often introduces differences in the baseline characteristics of the thymectomy and non-thymectomy patient groups that can effect myasthenia gravis outcomes independent of thymectomy. To the extent possible, the authors adjust for these confounding differences in baseline prognostic characteristics. In the absence of randomized controlled trials, such adjustments are critical for estimating the actual therapeutic effect, if any, of thymectomy. (Note: Class III studies were excluded from consideration.)</p>

<P>From the controlled studies describing outcomes, the following characteristics were abstracted: method and setting of cohort assembly, years during which patients were enrolled in the cohort, number of subjects assembled, duration of follow-up, proportion of subjects lost to follow-up, and the thymectomy techniques employed.</P>

<P>Because of reported associations with myasthenia gravis outcomes, the authors also extracted the following study population characteristics: proportion of patients younger than 50 years at the time of diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, proportion of female patients with more severe myasthenia gravis at the time of diagnosis (defined by Osserman's grade 2b, 3, or 4), and the proportion of patients with strictly ocular myasthenia at the time of diagnosis.</P>

<P>Thymectomy in patients with thymoma has benefits other than myasthenia gravis treatment. Therefore, patients with thymoma were excluded from the analysis.</P>

<P>In reviewing each study the authors considered the following myasthenia gravis outcomes: survival (taking into account perioperative mortality), improvement since diagnosis, asymptomatic on or off medication, and asymptomatic off medication (i.e., medication-free remission).</P>

<P>Ideally, controlled studies of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis patients report outcomes using time-to-outcome (survival) techniques.  Survival techniques account for the differences in the duration of follow-up and changes in outcomes over time. Unfortunately, most controlled studies of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis simply report the proportion, or crude rate, of patients achieving an outcome over the study’s follow-up period. Crude outcome rates vary with the duration of follow-up of the study. Within a given study, however, crude outcome rates of the thymectomy and nonthymectomy patient groups can be compared when the patient groups have similar follow-up durations.</P>

<P>To compare the crude rates within a given controlled study, the authors calculated the relative rate by dividing the thymectomy patient group’s crude rate of achieving the outcome by the nonthymectomy patient group’s crude rate of achieving the outcome using the formula presented in table 1 of the guideline document.</P>

<P>The authors also calculated the 95% confidence interval of these relative rates. Calculation of the relative outcome rates in this manner compensates for differences in follow-up duration between controlled studies, and allows the analysis of the results of all controlled thymectomy myasthenia gravis studies.</P>

<P>In studies providing sufficient information, the authors re-calculated the relative rates of outcomes after controlling for potential confounding variables of age, gender, and severity of myasthenia. The authors used Wilcoxon’s test to determine significance of the changes in relative rates measured after controlling for these variables.</P></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Thymectomy complications</strong></p>

<P>Eleven of the studies reviewed here reported thymectomy-related mortality. Perioperative mortality rates were higher in patients undergoing thymectomy before 1970, with commonly reported rates between 5 and 15%. After 1970, reported mortality rates in the studies reviewed here were consistently less than 1%. Common morbidities include acute respiratory failure from crisis in 6%, infection in 11%, and permanent nerve injury (usually the recurrent laryngeal or phrenic nerve) in 2% of patients. Lower complication rates are reported with newer thymectomy techniques such as video-assisted thoracic surgery.</P>
