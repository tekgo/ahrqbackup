Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percent of eligible patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who were started on activated protein C (APC) within 48 hours following severe sepsis/septic shock identification.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Studies show that annually there are between 500,000 to one million cases of sepsis and severe sepsis in American hospitals. The annual mortality rate for these cases is between 15 and 30 percent or as many as 200,000 deaths. Many more patients suffer from permanent organ damage. The cost to society in dollars spent and lives lost prematurely is enormous. While there are many useful clinical interventions, research shows that they are applied inconsistently, if at all.</p>

<p>In a large, well-conducted, randomized trial, the use of activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis was associated with a five percent absolute reduction in hospital mortality and a six percent reduction in 28-day mortality. The risk of bleeding was similar to heparin. While the mortality benefits of this drug are clear, hospitals disagree over exactly which patients should receive this therapy and in which patients the risk/benefit ratio is favorable. For now, most facilities are relying on their own protocols. There are a number of large cohort studies under way to help clarify which patients should receive this therapy.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A study confirmed that patients with severe sepsis consume significant resources. The average hospital length of stay was 20 days at an average cost of $22,100. National cost estimates for the care of severe sepsis based on this study is $16.7 billion dollars, with the care of patients older than 65 costing $8.7 billion (52.3 percent), and care of those older than 75 costs $5.1 billion dollars (30.8 percent). The costs for caring for patients with sepsis are projected to rise approximately 1.5 percent per year due to the aging U.S. population.</p></div>
