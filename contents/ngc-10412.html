<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practical Application Points</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Several conservative interventions provide rapid relief of pain and improved pain-free grip including: eccentric extension exercise, elbow manipulation, soft tissue procedures (e.g., trigger point pressure in extensor muscles), and corticosteroid injections. </li>
    <li>Set outcome goals for sustainable self-management (exercise, massage, activity modification) to maintain pain reduction and improved function. </li>
    <li>One tennis elbow specific questionnaire and two more general upper arm function questionnaires have been shown to be sensitive to measure functional change in epicondylosis. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work-Related Epicondylosis (Epicondylitis)</strong></p>
<p>Epicondylosis is characterized by medial or lateral elbow pain that worsens when muscles originating from the condyles are contracted, placing stress on the attachments. Lateral epicondylosis or "tennis elbow" is common, often associated with direct trauma to the lateral elbow. Repetitive work does not appear to be a risk factor; although there may be a relationship between combined factors such as force, posture, trauma, and repetition. Diagnosis is clinical; no studies on diagnostic accuracy or reliability of clinical examination were found. Pain is related to degenerative change more so than inflammation. The condition is frequently self-limiting within 6 to 24 months.</p>
<p><strong>Case Definition</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Work-related lateral epicondylosis (LE) is lateral elbow pain subsequent to a documented workplace exposure that is worsened by gripping and resisted wrist extension. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evaluation Summary</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Rule out non-mechanical causes (typically by assessing for red flags for trauma/fracture, tumor, etc.) </li>
    <li>Pain over the epicondyles provoked by resisted extensor contraction (e.g., gripping, twisting motions) is consistent with epicondylosis. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intervention Summary</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Most acute/sub-acute cases self-resolve within weeks to months. Rapid resolution has been reported with slow stretching, eccentric resisted contraction exercise, elbow manipulation, soft tissue wok (effleurage massage, trigger point pressure, mechanically assisted tissue work). Extension bracing and/or activity modification may be helpful. </li>
    <li>Benefit has been reported in lesser quality studies with iontophoresis and phonophoresis applied non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Ultrasound does not appear to provide any advantage over placebo. </li>
    <li>Short-term relief for corticosteroid injection may be outweighed by poorer one-year outcomes compared to physiotherapy or wait and see approaches. </li>
    <li>Chronic conditions are thought by some to be related to tendon degeneration more than an inflammatory process from microtears. Treatment options are similar with some consideration. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improvement Progress</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Achieving and monitoring functional progress is central to effective care of epicondylosis. The best overall long-term outcomes are believed to be associated with consistent, incremental increases in functional ability (e.g., pain-free grip strength, improving mobility, return to usual activities including work). </li>
    <li>Refractory cases warrant consideration for additional diagnostics to assess for tendon rupture or muscle tear. </li>
</ul>

                <li>Sustained functional gains should be tracked using a functional questionnaire specific to tennis elbow or the upper extremity. </li>
                <li>Myofascial release and manipulation of elbow structures are effective. Rapid transition to self-management using eccentric resistance contraction exercise and massage should be encouraged. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>Individual articles were reviewed by both a clinical expert and epidemiologist with subsequent clinical expert group review to resolve inconsistencies.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing Study Methodologic Quality</strong></p>
<p>Attributes of study methodology quality vary according to the clinical procedure (e.g., diagnostic, therapeutic intervention) looked at, and specific research questions being studied. The American Academy of Neurology's Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual offers a comprehensive guide to systematic evidence review, quality attributes and consensus process that generally serves as the approach taken by Industrial Insurance Chiropractic Advisory Committee (IICAC).</p>
<p>General attributes identified when extracting evidence from studies include identification of population, the intervention and co-interventions and outcomes being addressed in each study. The clinical questions addressed such as diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic effectiveness, or causation are determined. Studies are extracted into evidence tables including quality attributes and/or ratings which are reviewed both by department staff and committee members (usually 2 per study).</p>
<p>Specific quality attributes include: Diagnostic Accuracy &ndash; design, spectrum of patients, validity and relevance of outcome metric; Therapeutic Interventions &ndash; comparison groups (no treatment, placebo, comparative intervention), treatment allocation, blinding/masking (method and degree: single, double, independent), follow-up (period and completion), and analysis (statistical power, intent-to-treat). Specific attention is paid to several factors including reporting of outcomes (primary vs. secondary), relevance of outcome (e.g., function versus pain), and meaningfulness (clinically important change versus minimally detectable change).</p>
<p><strong>Synthesizing Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Consideration of study quality (class), significance (statistical precision), consistency across studies, magnitude of effect, and relevance to populations and procedures were taken into account in preparing draft summaries. Special attention was given to clarifying conclusions related to the clinical questions of interest. Evidence, particularly with low tech and highly diffused examination and conservative procedures addressed here, is rarely truly "definitive," even when multiple studies exist. Inconsistent conclusions typically reflect error (systematic, random) and/or bias in studies. Data pooling via meta-analysis is useful to reduce random error when studies are of sufficient power and methodologic strength. Larger meaningful effect size may increases confidence in findings.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The conservative care resource/guideline process can be described in the following steps:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Once a topic for a resource/guideline is selected, a subcommittee of the Industrial Insurance Chiropractic Advisory Committee (IICAC) made up of regular members identifies additional content experts to join the subcommittee and/or serve as consultants. Various clinical specialists may provide specific input or be invited to give a presentation to the subcommittee. </li>
    <li>A systematic review and summary of the relevant peer reviewed clinical and scientific literature is done (primarily by department staff and subcommittee members with specific interest and/or expertise in a topic). Claim and billing data from Labor &amp; Industries may also be reviewed. </li>
    <li>Literature is retrieved, assessed for quality and summarized in evidence tables which are presented to the subcommittee for review. Then at a variable series of group meetings and phone conferences, the evidence with greatest relevance to the resource/guideline topic is highlighted. </li>
    <li>Based on this literature review and assessment by the subcommittee, department staff typically develop an initial draft resource guideline generally organized as follows:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>General summary of topic, case definition, clinical evaluation, interventions, and clinical progress </li>
        <li>Checklist for general chronological management with expected clinical and progress thresholds </li>
        <li>Readily usable functional progress instruments for a given condition </li>
        <li>Evidence summaries for clinical assessment (e.g., history, examination, imaging and special studies, prognostic and management issues, workers' compensation issues) </li>
        <li>Evidence summaries for conservative interventions (e.g., physiotherapeutic modalities, bracing, manipulation and mobilization, soft tissue techniques, exercise and rehabilitation approaches, special interventions, common medications [injected and oral]), and workers compensation specific interventions (e.g., ergonomic interventions) </li>
        <li>Additional materials (glossaries, procedure descriptions, instrument scoring) </li>
        <li>Evidence and methodology process used in development </li>
        <li>Citations </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Subcommittee members critique and revise the guideline based on what is most useful for the clinician in diagnosing and treating the condition in question. Additional expertise, consultation, and literature searches may also be added. This results in a second draft guideline that is then shared with the full advisory committee to obtain their input. At this stage specific content experts/reviewers may be sought as the subcommittee identifies particular issues. </li>
