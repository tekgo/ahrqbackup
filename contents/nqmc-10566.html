Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure uses survey data to assess the percentage of Medicare members 65 years of age and older who received an influenza vaccination between July 1 of the measurement year and the date when the Medicare CAHPS survey was completed.</p>
<p>This measure is collected by Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) using the Medicare CAHPS Survey (Medicare).</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure looks at how well organizations help protect America's seniors from potentially life-threatening influenza outbreaks.</p>
<p>Influenza accounts for 10,000 to 40,000 or more deaths each year in the United States (U.S.) (Harper et al., 2005). Older adults are at high risk for developing serious infections (such as pneumonia) following the flu. For this reason, experts recommend that all adults over 65 receive a flu vaccination every year to reduce the risk of developing serious complications if they become infected. Vaccination programs against influenza have been shown to reduce the incidence of illness and death and are cost-effective, as well.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend yearly influenza vaccination for adults 65 and older to protect against infection and reduce the risk of complications from infection (ACP Task Force on Adult Immunization and Infectious Diseases Society, 1994; Barker &amp; Mullooly, 1980). </p>
<p>Specifications for this measure are consistent with current ACIP recommendations (Harper et al., 2005).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Influenza (flu) is a common and contagious respiratory illness caused by a set of viruses that can result in serious complications or death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], "Seasonal," 2013). The flu vaccine is recommended for all adults; vaccinations can reduce flu-related hospitalizations by 71 percent (Flu.gov, n.d.; Talbot et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>In 2010 there were 25 million cases of influenza in the United States (8.1 percent of the total population). The annual economic costs are $29.12 billion (Mao et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>About 90 percent of annual, seasonal flu-related deaths occur in people 65 years of age and older (CDC, "What you," 2013). </li>
    <li>The best protection against flu is to get the annual flu vaccine. Vaccination can prevent many hospitalizations, save thousands of lives and contribute to significant cost savings. </li>
