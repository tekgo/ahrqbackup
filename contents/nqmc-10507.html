<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States (U.S.). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that approximately three million people are infected with chlamydia each year. Risk factors associated with becoming infected with chlamydia are the same as risks for contracting other STDs (e.g., multiple sex partners). Chlamydia is more prevalent among adolescent (15 to 19) and young adult (20 to 24) women.</p>
<p>Screening is essential because the majority of women who have the condition do not experience symptoms. The main objective of chlamydia screening is to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and ectopic pregnancy, all of which have very high rates of occurrence among women with untreated chlamydia infection. The specifications for this measure are consistent with current clinical guidelines, such as those of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2001).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Chlamydia is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States, occurring most often among adolescent and young adult females (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014; National Chlamydia Coalition [NCC], 2010). Untreated chlamydia infections can lead to serious and irreversible complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility and increased risk of becoming infected with HIV (CDC, 2014). Screening is important, as approximately 75 percent of chlamydia infections in women and 95 percent of infections in men are asymptomatic, resulting in delayed medical care and treatment (Meyers, Halvorson, &amp; Luckhaupt, 2007). </li>
    <li>The total lifetime direct medical cost of chlamydia infections is estimated at $517 million (Owusu-Edusei et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>Chlamydia is easily detected and treated, but screening remains underutilized. Challenges affecting annual screening rates include lack of patient awareness and social stigma about seeking or discussing screening (CDC, 2011). </li>
    <li>If the chlamydia screening rate for sexually active young women increased to 90 percent, thousands of cases of PID could be prevented annually (Partnership for Prevention, 2007). </li>
    <li>Chlamydia screening can catch infections early and prevent serious complications, such as PID and infertility. </li>
</ul>
