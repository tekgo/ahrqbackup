<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insulin Pump Therapy without Sensor Augmentation</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) over analog-based basal-bolus multiple daily injections (MDI) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who have not achieved their A1C goal, as long as the patient and caregivers are willing and able to use the device. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends CSII over analog-based basal-bolus MDI in patients with T1DM who have achieved their A1C goal but continue to experience severe hypoglycemia or high glucose variability, as long as the patient and caregivers are willing and able to use the device. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests CSII in patients with T1DM who require increased insulin delivery flexibility or improved satisfaction and are capable of using the device. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insulin Pump Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests CSII with good adherence to monitoring and dosing in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have poor glycemic control despite intensive insulin therapy, oral agents, other injectable therapy, and lifestyle modifications. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insulin Pump Use in the Hospital</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that clinicians continue CSII in patients admitted to the hospital with either type of diabetes if the institution has clear protocols for evaluating patients as suitable candidates and appropriate monitoring and safety procedures. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection of Candidates for Insulin Pump Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that before prescribing CSII, clinicians perform a structured assessment of a patient's mental and psychological status, prior adherence with diabetes self-care measures, willingness and interest in trying the device, and availability for the required follow-up visits. (<strong>1|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Bolus Calculators in Insulin Pump Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests encouraging patients to use appropriately adjusted embedded bolus calculators in CSII and have appropriate education regarding their use and limitations. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitors in Adult Outpatients </span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) devices for adult patients with T1DM who have A1C levels above target and who are willing and able to use these devices on a nearly daily basis. (<strong>1|++++)</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends RT-CGM devices for adult patients with well-controlled T1DM who are willing and able to use these devices on a nearly daily basis. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests short-term, intermittent RT-CGM use in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (not on prandial insulin) who have A1C levels &ge;7% and are willing and able to use the device. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education and Training on the Use of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion and Continuous Glucose Monitoring</span></strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that adults with T1DM and T2DM who use CSII and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) receive education, training, and ongoing support to help achieve and maintain individualized glycemic goals. (<strong>Ungraded Good Practice Statement</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse</strong>: The Task Force commissioned a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and also used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>The reviewers included randomized trials (RCTs) that enrolled patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 and compared real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RTCGM) versus control group (usually a blinded RTCGM) and reported the outcome of interest (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] at baseline and follow up, time spent in hypoglycemia, and number of hypoglycemic events).</p>
<p>Several databases were searched from each database's earliest inception until January 2015, without language restrictions (Ovid Medline In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus). Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used.</p>
<p>Abstracts and titles that resulted from executing the search strategy were independently evaluated by two reviewers for potential eligibility and the full text versions of all potentially eligible studies were obtained. Two reviewers working independently considered the full text reports for eligibility. Disagreements were reconciled by consensus and if not possible by consensus through arbitration by a third reviewer.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse</strong>: The Task Force commissioned a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and also used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>A list of potential included studies was sent to the Endocrine Society Task Force developing the guideline on real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RTCGM) for verification. The corresponding author of each trial was contacted via emails requesting individual patient data. Data from each participant included (when available): demographics (age, sex, ethnicity), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (baseline, during follow-up, at the endpoint), follow-up period, number of events of hypoglycemia (whether symptomatic or not, value of glucose), time spend in hypoglycemia, time of the episode of hypoglycemia (night, day, after exercise/playtime for children), type of device/manufacture/sensor versus no sensor, body mass index (BMI), weight, skill level and education provided to patient/parents' education, adherence to wearing the device, diabetes duration, and insulin delivery system (pump versus multiple daily injections). The reviewers used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to appraise the methodological limitations of each trial.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using Stata Statistical Software: Release 14 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). A two-step regression model was used to estimate the pooled difference in means for HbA1c and time in hypoglycemia with 95% confidence intervals (CI). When reported, the reviewers pooled the mean number of hypoglycemic events in each arm. Subgroup analysis was based on age and sex.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk of Bias Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>The overall risk of bias in the included trials was moderate to high. Quality was downgraded mainly due to not reporting allocation concealment, lack of outcome assessor blinding and source of funding (in all trials, funding source was for profit companies).</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The goal of glucose management in all types of diabetes is to minimize and hopefully eliminate the acute and chronic complications associated with diabetes, such as the risks of microvascular complications and potentially (to a lesser degree) macrovascular complications and mortality. All persons with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) require insulin, and persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently need insulin for adequate glucose control. Advances in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin products and in the methods of insulin delivery and glucose monitoring are geared toward improving glucose control, minimizing hypoglycemia, and improving quality of life. Two such advances include continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). </li>
    <li>Despite the limitations of the available literature, there is relatively consistent evidence that current CSII is likely to improve glucose control in motivated patients with inadequate glucose control who are appropriately educated and supported. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the evidence sections in the original guideline document for additional discussion of the balance of benefits versus harms of CSII and CGM.</p>
