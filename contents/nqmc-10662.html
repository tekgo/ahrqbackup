<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, who undergo central venous catheter (CVC) insertion for whom CVC was inserted with all elements of maximal sterile barrier technique, hand hygiene, skin preparation and, if ultrasound is used, sterile ultrasound techniques followed. </p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Catheter-related bloodstream infection is a costly complication of central venous catheter (CVC) insertion, but may be avoided with routine use of aseptic technique during catheter insertion. This measure is constructed to require that all of the listed elements of aseptic technique are followed and documented. Hospital-acquired bloodstream infections are a common complication that leads to increased costs and mortality (Smith, Meixler, &amp; Simberkoff, 1991). It is estimated that approximately 51% of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections occur in an intensive care unit (ICU), with the presence of a central venous catheter being the largest risk factor for the development of a bloodstream infection in the hospital (Wisplinghoff et al., 2004). Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) commonly occur when the catheter becomes contaminated by microbes on the skin during insertion. The use of maximal sterile barriers, including sterile gloves, long-sleeved sterile gown, mask, cap, and full-sized sterile drape, during insertion of the catheter has been shown to cost effectively reduce CRBSI rates compared to the use of less stringent precautions (Raad et al., 1994; Sheretz et al., 2000; Carrer et al., 2005; Lee, Jung, &amp; Choi, 2008).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>:</p>
<p>Maximal sterile barrier precautions: Use maximal sterile barrier precautions, including the use of a cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves, and a sterile full body drape, for the insertion of CVCs, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCS), or guidewire exchange (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011).</p>
<p>Hand hygiene: Perform hand hygiene procedures, either by washing hands with conventional soap and water or with alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHR).</p>
<p><em>Skin Preparation</em>: Prepare clean skin with a greater than 0.5% chlorhexidine preparation with alcohol before central venous catheter and peripheral arterial catheter insertion and during dressing changes. If there is a contraindication to chlorhexidine, tincture of iodine, an iodophor, or 70% alcohol can be used as alternatives.</p>
<p><em>Sterile Ultrasound</em>: The Food and Drug Administration recommends that policies and clinical practice standards be reviewed to ensure the use of sterile ultrasound gel. Once a container of sterile or non-sterile ultrasound gel is opened, it is no longer sterile and contamination during ongoing use is possible.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Dataset</strong><br />
Medicare Limited Data Set Carrier SAF &ndash; 5% File; Anesthesia Quality Institute (AQI) National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry (NACOR)</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong><br />
Reliability was calculated according to the methods outlined in a technical report prepared by J.L. Adams titled <em>The Reliability of Provider Profiling: A Tutorial</em>. In this context, reliability represents the ability of a measure to confidently distinguish the performance of one physician from another. As discussed in the report: "Conceptually, it is the ratio of signal to noise. The signal in this case is the proportion of variability in measured performance that can be explained by real differences in performance. There are 3 main drivers of reliability; sample size, differences between physicians, and measurement error."</p>
<p>According to this approach, reliability is estimated with a beta-binomial model. The beta-binomial model is appropriate for measuring the reliability of pass/fail measures such as those proposed.</p>
<p>Reliability was tested on providers, practices and facilities where at least 2 cases were reported.</p>
<p>Reliability for the process <em>Prevention of Central Venous Catheter (CVC)-related Bloodstream Infections</em> measure is consistently greater than 0.9, and thus can be considered to be very good. This reflects the inclusion of that measure in public reporting programs, the number of years that the measure has been reported and the number of cases available to test and analyze. In the three years of NACOR data that as analyzed, reliability has remained stable and consistent but performance rates, as increases in data capture grew, fell in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><br />
Face validity of the measure score as an indicator of quality was systematically assessed as follows. After the measure was fully specified, a group of experts was assembled to rate face validity. The experts included 19 physicians.</p>
<p>The developer provided the detailed measure specifications to the experts and asked them to rate their agreement with the following statement: The scores obtained from the measure as specified will provide an accurate reflection of quality and can be used to distinguish good from poor quality.</p>
<p>The rating scale had five levels (1 to 5) with the following narrative anchors: 1 = Disagree; 3 = Moderate Agreement; 5 = Agree</p>
<p>As additional data and information become available on this measure, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) intends to conduct further measure validity testing on this measure.</p>
<p>The results of the assessment of face validity indicate that an independent group of experts (different from those who advised on measure development) had high levels of agreement with the statement: "The scores obtained from the measure as specified will provide an accurate reflection of quality and can be used to distinguish good and poor quality." </p>
<p>Mean rating = (4.16 out of 5)</p>
<p>This measure was examined through a group of experts. Out of the 19 participants, 17 agreed that the scores from the measure as specified would provide an accurate reflection of quality and 2 disagreed.</p></div>
