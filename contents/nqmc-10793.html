<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For almost 3 decades, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have had in place a standard requiring 39 completed weeks gestation prior to ELECTIVE delivery, either vaginal or operative (ACOG, 1996). A survey conducted in 2007 of almost 20,000 births in Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) hospitals throughout the United States (U.S.) carried out in conjunction with the March of Dimes at the request of ACOG revealed that almost one-third of all babies delivered in the U.S. are electively delivered with 5% of all deliveries in the U.S. delivered in a manner violating ACOG/AAP guidelines. Most of these are for convenience and result in significant short term neonatal morbidity (neonatal intensive care unit admission rates of 13% to 21%) (Clark et al., 2009).</p>
<p>According to Glantz (2005), compared to spontaneous labor, elective inductions result in more cesarean deliveries and longer maternal length of stay. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) (2000) also notes that elective induction doubles the cesarean delivery rate. Repeat elective cesarean sections before 39 weeks gestation also result in higher rates of adverse respiratory outcomes, mechanical ventilation, sepsis and hypoglycemia for the newborns (Tita et al., 2009).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In 2009, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published guidelines listing some of the acceptable medical indications for early induction of labor. Early term deliveries (between 37 and 38 weeks gestation) have increased dramatically from 1990 through 2006 and account for 17.5% of live births in the United States (U.S.) (Davidoff et al., 2006). These procedures are conducted without documented evidence supporting medical indication for early delivery. Clark et al. (2009) found that most early elective deliveries are for convenience and result in significant short term neonatal morbidity (neonatal intensive care unit admission rates of 13% to 21%). Clark et al. (2010) conducted a subsequent retrospective cohort study examining 27 hospitals, and determined that when strategies were implemented to reduce non-medically indicated elective early term deliveries, there was a reduction in elective deliveries of 9.6% to 4.3%. Consequently, the rate of term neonatal intensive care admission also fell by 16%. </li>
    <li>According to Glantz (2005), when comparing spontaneous labor, elective inductions result in more cesarean deliveries and longer maternal length of stay. The American Academy of Family Physicians (2000) also notes that elective induction doubles the cesarean delivery rate. Repeat elective cesarean sections before 39 weeks gestation also results in higher rates of adverse respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), mechanical ventilation, sepsis, and hypoglycemia for the newborns (Tita et al., 2009). Newborns born at 37 weeks gestation have a 7.5-fold greater rate of developing RDS versus those born at 39 to 41 weeks gestation. Early-term newborns born at 37 to 38 weeks gestation also are at higher risk for transient tachypnea of the newborn, pulmonary hypertension, hospital stays greater than 5 days as well as diagnoses associated with severe morbidities or death versus newborns delivered at 39 weeks gestation (Engle &amp; Kominiarek, 2008). </li>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Twenty-six contracted performance measurement systems (PMS) agreed to support the perinatal care measures. Joint Commission staff defined and developed a database structure for electronic receipt of measure data and a verification process was implemented to assure that measures were embedded into the measurement system's technical infrastructures and into their data collection tools in accord with Joint Commission specifications. Joint Commission staff also verified data collection tools and provided education regarding the performance measure set to PMS vendors, who in turn provided education and ongoing support to their contracted hospitals. </p>
<p>Once sufficient data to support this effort were received by The Joint Commission, a reliability assessment of the measures and individual data elements was conducted from October 2011 through January 2012. A data collection tool was developed to facilitate the reabstraction of selected medical records and assessment of the reliability of the data elements. Reliability test site visits were conducted by Joint Commission staff at a subset of 12 randomly-selected hospitals. Selection of the sites was based on multiple characteristics, including hospital demographics, bed size and type of facility. </p>
<p>In the course of the reliability site visits, electronic and paper medical records were blindly reabstracted by Joint Commission staff. Reabstracted data elements were then compared with the hospital's originally abstracted data on a data element to data element basis. Differences in abstraction were investigated and adjudicated in order to understand the reasons for any disparities. In addition, structured focus group discussions were held at each site to gather additional feedback on the measures. A resource evaluation was also completed by the site visit hospitals to assess the cost and time associated with data collection effort. Feedback from the focus group discussions has been incorporated into the measure summaries. </p></div>
