Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of recommendation (<strong>1A&ndash;2C, consensus-based [CB]</strong>) and the approach to rating the quality of evidence are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Choice of Long-Term (First 3 Months) and Extended (No Scheduled Stop Date) Anticoagulant</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>In patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), the panel recommends long-term (3 months) anticoagulant therapy over no such therapy (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with DVT of the leg or PE and no cancer, as long-term (ﬁrst 3 months) anticoagulant therapy, the panel suggests dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (<strong>all Grade 2B</strong>). For patients with DVT of the leg or PE and no cancer who are not treated with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, the panel suggests VKA therapy over low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Initial parenteral anticoagulation is given before dabigatran and edoxaban, is not given before rivaroxaban and apixaban, and is overlapped with VKA therapy. See text in the original guideline document for factors that inﬂuence choice of therapy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with DVT of the leg or PE and cancer ("cancer-associated thrombosis"), as long-term (ﬁrst 3 months) anticoagulant therapy, the panel suggests LMWH over VKA therapy (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>), dabigatran (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>), rivaroxaban (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>), apixaban (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>), or edoxaban (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Initial parenteral anticoagulation is given before dabigatran and edoxaban, is not given before rivaroxaban and apixaban, and is overlapped with VKA therapy. See text in the original guideline document for factors that inﬂuence choice of therapy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with DVT of the leg or PE who receive extended therapy, the panel suggests that there is no need to change the choice of anticoagulant after the ﬁrst 3 months (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: It may be appropriate for the choice of anticoagulant to change in response to changes in the patient's circumstances or preferences during long-term or extended phases of treatment.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Duration of Anticoagulant Therapy</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>In patients with a proximal DVT of the leg or PE provoked by surgery, the panel recommends treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over (i) treatment of a shorter period (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>), (ii) treatment of a longer time-limited period (e.g., 6, 12, or 24 months) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>), or (iii) extended therapy (no scheduled stop date) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with a proximal DVT of the leg or PE provoked by a nonsurgical transient risk factor, the panel recommends treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over (i) treatment of a shorter period (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>) and (ii) treatment of a longer time-limited period (e.g., 6, 12, or 24 months) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). The panel suggests treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over extended therapy if there is a low or moderate bleeding risk (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>), and recommend treatment for 3 months over extended therapy if there is a high risk of bleeding (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: In all patients who receive extended anticoagulant therapy, the continuing use of treatment should be reassessed at periodic intervals (e.g., annually).</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with an isolated distal DVT of the leg provoked by surgery or by a nonsurgical transient risk factor, the panel suggests treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over treatment of a shorter period (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>), the panel recommends treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over treatment of a longer time-limited period (e.g., 6, 12, or 24 months) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>), and the panel recommends treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over extended therapy (no scheduled stop date) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Duration of treatment of patients with isolated distal DVT refers to patients in whom a decision has been made to treat with anticoagulant therapy; however, it is anticipated that not all patients who are diagnosed with isolated distal DVT will be prescribed anticoagulants.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with an unprovoked DVT of the leg (isolated distal or proximal) or PE, the panel recommends treatment with anticoagulation for at least 3 months over treatment of a shorter duration (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>), and the panel recommends treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over treatment of a longer time-limited period (e.g., 6, 12, or 24 months) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: After 3 months of treatment, patients with unprovoked DVT of the leg or PE should be evaluated for the risk-beneﬁt ratio of extended therapy. Duration of treatment of patients with isolated distal DVT refers to patients in whom a decision has been made to treat with anticoagulant therapy; however, it is anticipated that not all patients who are diagnosed with isolated distal DVT will be prescribed anticoagulants.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with a ﬁrst VTE that is an unprovoked proximal DVT of the leg or PE and who have a (i) low or moderate bleeding risk (see text in the original guideline document), the panel suggests extended anticoagulant therapy (no scheduled stop date) over 3 months of therapy (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>), and (ii) high bleeding risk (see text in the original guideline document), the panel recommends 3 months of anticoagulant therapy over extended therapy (no scheduled stop date) (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Patient sex and D-dimer level measured a month after stopping anticoagulant therapy may inﬂuence the decision to stop or extend anticoagulant therapy (see text in the original guideline document). In all patients who receive extended anticoagulant therapy, the continuing use of treatment should be reassessed at periodic intervals (e.g., annually).</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with a second unprovoked VTE and who have a (i) low bleeding risk (see text in the original guideline document), the panel recommends extended anticoagulant therapy (no scheduled stop date) over 3 months (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>); (ii) moderate bleeding risk (see text in the original guideline document), the panel suggests extended anticoagulant therapy over 3 months of therapy (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>); or (iii) high bleeding risk (see text in the original guideline document), the panel suggests 3 months of anticoagulant therapy over extended therapy (no scheduled stop date) (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: In all patients who receive extended anticoagulant therapy, the continuing use of treatment should be reassessed at periodic intervals (e.g., annually).</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with DVT of the leg or PE and active cancer ("cancer-associated thrombosis") and who (i) do not have a high bleeding risk, the panel recommends extended anticoagulant therapy (no scheduled stop date) over 3 months of therapy (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>), or (ii) have a high bleeding risk, the panel suggests extended anticoagulant therapy (no scheduled stop date) over 3 months of therapy (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: In all patients who receive extended anticoagulant therapy, the continuing use of treatment should be reassessed at periodic intervals (e.g., annually). </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Aspirin for Extended Treatment of VTE</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="12">
    <li>In patients with an unprovoked proximal DVT or PE who are stopping anticoagulant therapy and do not have a contraindication to aspirin, the panel suggests aspirin over no aspirin to prevent recurrent VTE (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Because aspirin is expected to be much less effective at preventing recurrent VTE than anticoagulants, the panel does not consider aspirin a reasonable alternative to anticoagulant therapy in patients who want extended therapy. However, if a patient has decided to stop anticoagulants, prevention of recurrent VTE is one of the beneﬁts of aspirin that needs to be balanced against aspirin's risk of bleeding and inconvenience. Use of aspirin should also be reevaluated when patients stop anticoagulant therapy because aspirin may have been stopped when anticoagulants were started.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Whether and How to Anticoagulate Isolated Distal DVT</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="13">
    <li>In patients with acute isolated distal DVT of the leg and (i) without severe symptoms or risk factors for extension (see text in original guideline document), the panel suggests serial imaging of the deep veins for 2 weeks over anticoagulation (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>) or (ii) with severe symptoms or risk factors for extension (see text in the original guideline document), the panel suggests anticoagulation over serial imaging of the deep veins (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Patients at high risk for bleeding are more likely to beneﬁt from serial imaging. Patients who place a high value on avoiding the inconvenience of repeat imaging and a low value on the inconvenience of treatment and on the potential for bleeding are likely to choose initial anticoagulation over serial imaging.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with acute isolated distal DVT of the leg who are managed with anticoagulation, the panel recommends using the same anticoagulation as for patients with acute proximal DVT (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with acute isolated distal DVT of the leg who are managed with serial imaging, the panel (i) recommends no anticoagulation if the thrombus does not extend (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>), (ii) suggests anticoagulation if the thrombus extends but remains conﬁned to the distal veins (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>), and (iii) recommends anticoagulation if the thrombus extends into the proximal veins (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis for Acute DVT of the Leg</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="16">
    <li>In patients with acute proximal DVT of the leg, the panel suggests anticoagulant therapy alone over catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Patients who are most likely to beneﬁt from CDT (see text in the original guideline document), who attach a high value to prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS), and a lower value to the initial complexity, cost, and risk of bleeding with CDT, are likely to choose CDT over anticoagulation alone.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Role of Inferior Vena Cava Filter in Addition to Anticoagulation for Acute DVT or PE</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="17">
    <li>In patients with acute DVT or PE who are treated with anticoagulants, the panel recommends against the use of an inferior vena cava ﬁlter (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Compression Stocking to Prevent PTS</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="18">
    <li>In patients with acute DVT of the leg, the panel suggests not using compression stockings routinely to prevent PTS (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: This recommendation focuses on prevention of the chronic complication of PTS and not on the treatment of symptoms. For patients with acute or chronic symptoms, a trial of graduated compression stockings is often justiﬁed.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Whether to Anticoagulate Subsegmental PE</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="19">
    <li>In patients with subsegmental PE (no involvement of more proximal pulmonary arteries) and no proximal DVT in the legs who have a (i) low risk for recurrent VTE (see text in the original guideline document), the panel suggests clinical surveillance over anticoagulation (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>) or (ii) high risk for recurrent VTE (see text in the original guideline document), the panel suggests anticoagulation over clinical surveillance (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Ultrasound imaging of the deep veins of both legs should be done to exclude proximal DVT. Clinical surveillance can be supplemented by serial ultrasound imaging of the proximal deep veins of both legs to detect evolving DVT (see text in the original guideline document). Patients and physicians are more likely to opt for clinical surveillance over anticoagulation if there is good cardiopulmonary reserve or a high risk of bleeding.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Treatment of Acute PE Out of the Hospital</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="20">
    <li>In patients with low-risk PE and whose home circumstances are adequate, the panel suggests treatment at home or early discharge over standard discharge (e.g., after the ﬁrst 5 days of treatment) (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Systemic Thrombolytic Therapy for PE</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="21">
    <li>In patients with acute PE associated with hypotension (e.g., systolic blood pressure [BP] &lt;90 mm Hg) who do not have a high bleeding risk, the panel suggests systemically administered thrombolytic therapy over no such therapy (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In most patients with acute PE not associated with hypotension, the panel recommends against systemically administered thrombolytic therapy (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>In selected patients with acute PE who deteriorate after starting anticoagulant therapy but have yet to develop hypotension and who have a low bleeding risk, the panel suggests systemically administered thrombolytic therapy over no such therapy (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Patients with PE and without hypotension who have severe symptoms or marked cardiopulmonary impairment should be monitored closely for deterioration. Development of hypotension suggests that thrombolytic therapy has become indicated. Cardiopulmonary deterioration (e.g., symptoms, vital signs, tissue perfusion, gas exchange, cardiac biomarkers) that has not progressed to hypotension may also alter the risk-beneﬁt assessment in favor of thrombolytic therapy in patients initially treated with anticoagulation alone. </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Catheter-Based Thrombus Removal for the Initial Treatment of PE</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="24">
    <li>In patients with acute PE who are treated with a thrombolytic agent, the panel suggests systemic thrombolytic therapy using a peripheral vein over CDT (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Patients who have a higher risk of bleeding with systemic thrombolytic therapy and who have access to the expertise and resources required to do CDT are likely to choose CDT over systemic thrombolytic therapy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with acute PE associated with hypotension and who have (i) a high bleeding risk, (ii) failed systemic thrombolysis, or (iii) shock that is likely to cause death before systemic thrombolysis can take effect (e.g., within hours), if appropriate expertise and resources are available, the panel suggests catheter-assisted thrombus removal over no such intervention (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Catheter-assisted thrombus removal refers to mechanical interventions, with or without catheter directed thrombolysis.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy for the Treatment of Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="26">
    <li>In selected patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) who are identiﬁed by an experienced thromboendarterectomy team, the panel suggests pulmonary thromboendarterectomy over no pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Patients with CTEPH should be evaluated by a team with expertise in treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is often lifesaving and life-transforming. Patients with CTEPH who are not candidates for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy may beneﬁt from other mechanical and pharmacological interventions designed to lower pulmonary arterial pressure. </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thrombolytic Therapy in Patients With Upper Extremity DVT </strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="27">
    <li>In patients with acute upper extremity DVT (UEDVT) that involves the axillary or more proximal veins, the panel suggests anticoagulant therapy alone over thrombolysis (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Patients who (i) are most likely to beneﬁt from thrombolysis (see text in the original guideline document); (ii) have access to CDT; (iii) attach a high value to prevention of PTS; and (iv) attach a lower value to the initial complexity, cost, and risk of bleeding with thrombolytic therapy are likely to choose thrombolytic therapy over anticoagulation alone.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients with UEDVT who undergo thrombolysis, the panel recommends the same intensity and duration of anticoagulant therapy as in patients with UEDVT who do not undergo thrombolysis (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Management of Recurrent VTE on Anticoagulant Therapy</strong></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="29">
    <li>In patients who have recurrent VTE on VKA therapy (in the therapeutic range) or on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban (and are believed to be compliant), the panel suggests switching to treatment with LMWH at least temporarily (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Recurrent VTE while on therapeutic-dose anticoagulant therapy is unusual and should prompt the following assessments: (1) reevaluation of whether there truly was a recurrent VTE; (2) evaluation of compliance with anticoagulant therapy; and (3) consideration of an underlying malignancy. A temporary switch to LMWH will usually be for at least 1 month.</p>
    </li>
    <li>In patients who have recurrent VTE on long-term LMWH (and are believed to be compliant), the panel suggests increasing the dose of LMWH by about one-quarter to one-third (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>).
    <p><em>Remarks</em>: Recurrent VTE while on therapeutic-dose anticoagulant therapy is unusual and should prompt the following assessments: (1) reevaluation of whether there truly was a recurrent VTE; (2) evaluation of compliance with anticoagulant therapy; and (3) consideration of an underlying malignancy. </p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection of Topics and Key Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>First, all of the topic areas from the 9th Edition of the Antithrombotic Guideline (AT9) were listed and potential new topics proposed by the panel members were added. Next, all panel members voted on whether each topic should be included in the update. Finally, the full panel reviewed the results of the vote and decided on the final list. The panel selected a total of 15 topics: 12 "update topics" from AT9 and 3 "new topics." For each topic, standardized questions in the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome format were developed (see e-Table 2 in the Online Supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Search</span></strong></p>
<p>Systematic methods were used to search for evidence for each question. When available, the National Library of Medicine's medical subject headings keyword nomenclature was used. MEDLINE via PubMed was searched for original studies and the Cochrane Library for systematic reviews. For update topics, the literature from January 2005 to July 2014 was searched. For new topics, the literature from 1946 (MEDLINE inception) to July 2014 was searched. All searches were limited to English-language publications. Searches were augmented by checking reference lists of published articles and personal files, and with ongoing surveillance of the literature by panel members (see e-Figures 1-4 in the Online Supplement).</p>
<p>When systematic reviews were identified, their quality was assessed according to the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool. Those that were of highest quality and up to date were used as the source of evidence. In the absence of a satisfactory systematic review, the guideline panel did their own evidence synthesis using the primary studies identified in AT9 and in the updated search. If the panel judged that the identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were inadequate, the search was expanded to include prospective cohort studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>The criteria for selecting the evidence were based on the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome elements of the standardized questions and the study design (see e-Table 2 in the Online Supplement). Standard processes (duplicate independent work with agreement checking and disagreement resolution) were followed for title and abstract screening, full text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Based on the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, quality of evidence (also known as certainty of evidence) is defined as the extent to which confidence in the effect estimate is adequate to support a recommendation. The quality of evidence is categorized as high (A level), moderate (B level), or low (includes very low) (C level). The rating of the quality of evidence reflects the strengths and limitations of the body of evidence and was based on the study design, risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of results, and likelihood of publication bias, in addition to factors specific to observational studies (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Data Abstraction and Data Analysis</strong></span></p>
<p>Standard processes (duplicate independent work with agreement checking and disagreement resolution) were followed for title and abstract screening, full text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. Data were abstracted on the characteristics of: study design, participants, intervention, control, outcomes, funding, and conflict of interest (COI). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool in randomized trials and an adapted tool for observational studies (see e-Table 3 in the Online Supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p>When existing systematic reviews were not available or were inadequate, meta-analyses were performed when appropriate. For each outcome of interest, the risk ratios of individual studies were calculated, then were pooled and statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the<em> I<sup>2</sup></em> statistic. A fixed-effects model was used when pooling data from two trials, or when one of the included trials was large relative to the others. Otherwise, a random-effects model was used. Review Manager software (version 5.2) was used to perform the meta-analyses and construct forest plots. Absolute effects were calculated by applying pooled relative risks to baseline risks, ideally estimated from valid prognostic observational data or, in the absence of the latter, from control group risks. When credible data from prognostic observational studies were not available, risk estimates from control groups of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the meta-analyses were used (see e-Figures 5 and 6 in the Online Supplement).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Assessing Quality of Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p>GRADEpro software (version 3.6) was used to generate tables to summarize the judgments of the quality of the evidence and the relative and absolute effects. The GRADE tables include Summary of Findings tables presented in the main text, and a more detailed version called Evidence Profiles presented in the Online Supplement. The evidence profiles also explicitly link recommendations to the supporting evidence.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Composition and Selection of Topic Panel Members</span></strong></p>
<p>The Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC) at the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) appointed the editor for the guideline update. Then, the editor nominated the project executive committee, the chair, and the remaining panelists (see the Acknowledgments section in the original guideline document). The GOC approved all panelists after review of their qualifications and conflict of interest (COI) disclosures. The 15 panelists include general internists, thrombosis specialists, pulmonologists, hematologists, and methodologists.</p>
<p>Throughout guideline development, panelists were required to disclose any potential financial or intellectual conflicts of interest (COI) by topic. Financial and intellectual conflicts of interest were classified as primary (more serious) or secondary (less serious) (see e-Table 1 in the Online Supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Panelists with primary COIs were required to abstain from voting on related topic areas, but could participate in discussions provided they refrained from strong advocacy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drafting of Recommendations</span></strong> </p>
<p>Following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which the guideline panel can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects. The strength of recommendation was categorized as strong (grade 1) or weak/conditional (grade 2). In determining the strength of the recommendation, the panel considered the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences (typically tradeoff between recurrent venous thromboembolism [VTE] and bleeding events), quality of evidence, resource implications, and patients' average values and preferences for different outcomes and management options.</p>
<p>The chair drafted the recommendations after the entire panel had reviewed the evidence and discussed the recommendation. Recommendations were then revised over a series of conference calls and through e-mail exchanges with the entire panel. A major aim was to ensure recommendations were specific and unambiguous.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods for Achieving Consensus</span></strong> </p>
<p>The panel used a modified Delphi technique to achieve consensus on each recommendation. This technique aims to minimize group interaction bias and to maintain anonymity among respondents. Using an online survey (<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com" title="SurveyMonkey Web site">www.surveymonkey.com</a>), panelists without a primary COI voted their level of agreement with each recommendation (including quality of evidence and strength of recommendation) based on a 5-point scale derived from the GRADE grid (strongly agree, weakly agree, neutral, weakly disagree, strongly disagree). Each panelist could also provide open-ended feedback on each recommendation with suggested wording edits or general remarks. To achieve consensus and be included in the final manuscript, each recommendation had to have at least 80% agreement (strong or weak) with a response rate of at least 75% of eligible panel members. All recommendations achieved consensus in the first round. The panel then used an iterative approach that involved review by, and approval from, all panel members for the writing of this manuscript. </p></div>

</ul>
<p class="Note"><sup>a</sup>The presence of major contraindications usually precludes use of thrombolytic therapy; consequently, these factors have not been well studied as risk factors for bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy. Patients with 1 or more major contraindication are usually considered to be "high risk for bleeding with thrombolytic therapy." The factors listed in this list are consistent with other recommendations for the use of thrombolytic therapy in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE).</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>b</sup>Risk factors for bleeding during anticoagulant therapy that are noted in Table 11 in the original guideline document that are not included in this table are also likely to be relative contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. The increase in bleeding associated with a risk factor will vary with: (1) severity of the risk factor (e.g., extent of trauma or recent surgery) and (2) temporal relationships (e.g., interval from surgery or a previous bleeding episode; believed to decrease markedly after approximately 2 weeks). Risk factors for bleeding at critical sites (e.g., intracranial, intraocular) or noncompressible sites are stronger contraindications for thrombolytic therapy. Depending on the nature, severity, temporality, and number of relative contraindications, patients may be considered "high risk of bleeding with thrombolytic therapy" or "non-high risk for thrombolytic therapy." Patients with no risk factors, 1-2 minor risk factors (e.g., female and black race) are usually considered "low risk of bleeding with thrombolytic therapy." Among 32,000 Medicare patients (&ge;65 years) with myocardial infarction who were treated with thrombolytic therapy, the following factors were independently associated with intracranial haemorrhage: age &ge;75 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.6); black (OR, 1.6); female (OR, 1.4); previous stroke (OR, 1.5); systolic BP &ge;160 mmHg (OR, 1.8); women &le;65 kg or men &le;80 kg (OR, 1.5); INR &gt;4 (OR, 2.2). The rate of intracranial hemorrhage increased from 0.7% with 0 or 1 of these risk factors, to 4.1% with &ge;5 risk factors. Among 32,000 patients with myocardial infraction who were treated with thrombolytic therapy in 5 clinical trials, the following factors were independently associated with moderate or severe bleeding: older age (OR, 1.04 per year); black (OR, 1.4); female (OR, 1.5); hypertension (OR, 1.2); lower weight (OR, 0.99 per kg). The guideline panel estimates that systemic thrombolytic therapy is associated with relative risk of major bleeding of 3.5 within 35 days (relative risk [RR], approximately 7 for intracranial bleeding); about three-quarters of the excess of major bleeds with thrombolytic therapy occur in the first 24 hours.</p>
