<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The classes of evidence (I-III) and levels of recommendation (1-3) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 1 Standards</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Child restraint and restraint systems reduce injury and injury severity in all ages reported and are recommended for use.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The highest reductions come from age appropriate, properly used restraints, as per the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines on selection and use of car safety seats. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note">Please note that these recommendations rose to Level 1 standards based on the preponderance of available literature, including well-done Class II data, that supports the age-appropriate use of child restraints and restraint systems as successful in the reduction of morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level 2 Guidelines</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Rear seat position reduces injury at all ages studied and is recommended especially for those less than or equal to 12 years of age. </li>
    <li>Airbags can cause injury and/or death to children less than or equal to 12 years of age and thus seating position with exposure to airbags should be avoided in that age range. </li>
    <li>Child restraint laws help reduce injury and mortality and increase compliance with restraint use. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>Child restraints are clearly effective in injury prevention and reduction of injury severity at all ages examined. Rear seat position is also effective, especially when used in conjunction with child restraints. Legislation is also effective in improving compliance and even reducing injury. There are some data showing that primary laws are the most effective form of legislation. Further research is required on the effectiveness of legislation on injury and mortality.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Classes of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective, randomized clinical trials</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Clinical studies in which data were collected prospectively or retrospective analyses based on clearly reliable data</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Studies based on retrospectively collected data</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong>: The recommendation is convincingly justifiable based on the available scientific information alone. This recommendation is usually based on Class I data, however, strong class II evidence may form the basis for a level 1 recommendation, especially if the issue does not lend itself to testing in a randomized format. Conversely, low quality or contradictory Class I data may not be able to support a level 1 recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong>: The recommendation is reasonably justifiable by available scientific evidence and strongly supported by expert opinion. This recommendation is usually supported by Class II data or a preponderance of Class III evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong>: The recommendation is supported by available data but adequate scientific evidence is lacking. This recommendation is generally supported by Class III data. This type of recommendation is useful for educational purposes and in guiding future clinical research.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Child Passenger Safety Workgroup conducted a Medline search for human, English language literature from 1980 to 2006 on child passenger restraints. Child passenger restraints as keyword only yielded four results. Using "Protective Devices" or "Seat Belts" and combining that with "infant" over similar dates and restrictions, 491 references resulted, with toddler, six resulted, with "child," 827 references resulted and with "adolescent," 842 resulted. Studies from other countries that involved legislation were dropped due to issues of generalizability. Fifty-nine were deemed appropriate to answer the above questions, 55 of these were available for review. Fourteen articles examined legislation and 41 articles examined restraint effectiveness with relation to outcomes. We did not utilize technical reports or engineering literature, but felt these were not relevant to the endpoints of morbidity or mortality and many could not be subject to scientific review.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>PubMed, PubMed Central, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched from October 12, 2010 to October 12, 2015 using the search terms child restraint system, infant seat belts, child seat belts, infant protective devices, and child protective devices. All articles with injury and/or mortality as an outcome were included. Non-English language, non-injury outcomes, technical articles, editorials, and opinion papers were excluded.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations were made on the basis of the studies included in the evidentiary table (see the appendix of the original guideline document). Recommendations were classified as level 1, 2, or 3 according to the definitions listed in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive literature search was performed Articles were first screened by title and abstract, then salient articles were reviewed by a single reviewer. The final articles list (N=3) was reviewed, and no articles were found to contradict the recommendations in the 2010 guideline. Recent research has largely focused on family compliance with restraint systems. Barriers to use, surveys, and engineering advances to improve ease of use, international perspectives, and compliance with restraint use are the major contributions to the field in the past 5 years.</p></div>

Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
