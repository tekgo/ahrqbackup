Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>A-E, L</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>All patients with fetal hydrops should be referred promptly to a tertiary care centre for evaluation. Some conditions amenable to prenatal treatment represent a therapeutic emergency after 18 weeks. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Etiologies</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li>Fetal chromosome analysis and genetic microarray molecular testing should be offered where available in all cases of non-immune fetal hydrops where available. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prenatal Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>Imaging studies should include comprehensive obstetrical ultrasound (including arterial and venous fetal Doppler) and fetal echocardiography. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Investigation for maternal&ndash;fetal infections, and alpha-thalassemia in women at risk because of their ethnicity, should be performed in all cases of unexplained fetal hydrops. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>To evaluate the risk of fetal anemia, Doppler measurement of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity should be performed in all hydropic fetuses after 16 weeks of gestation. In case of suspected fetal anemia, fetal blood sampling and intrauterine transfusion should be offered rapidly. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prognosis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
    <li>All cases of unexplained fetal hydrops should be referred to a medical genetics service where available. Detailed postnatal evaluation by a medical geneticist should be performed on all cases of newborns with unexplained non-immune hydrops. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Perinatal Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="7">
    <li>Autopsy should be recommended in all cases of fetal or neonatal death or pregnancy termination. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) Amniotic fluid and/or fetal cells should be stored for future genetic testing. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence Assessment*</strong></p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed or MEDLINE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library in 2011 using key words (non-immune hydrops fetalis, fetal hydrops, fetal therapy, fetal metabolism). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, observational studies, and significant case reports. Additional publications were identified from the bibliographies of these articles. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to May 2012. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate investigation and management of non-immune fetal hydrops </li>
    <li>Education of readers about the causes of non-immune fetal hydrops and its prenatal counselling and management </li>
    <li>Provision of a standardized approach to non-immune fetal hydrops, emphasizing the search for prenatally treatable conditions and recurrent genetic etiologies </li>
    <li>Diagnosing or ruling out a metabolic disorder as the causal factor for non-immune fetal hydrops is important because these single gene disorders carry a 25% risk of recurrence, and their identification may allow for prenatal diagnosis at an earlier stage in future pregnancies. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Traditional serological tests, which measure antibody levels including immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), usually require two samples separated by a significant time period for determination of seroconversion or a substantial rise in titer. IgM identification is more indicative than IgG of a recent infection; however, IgM may persist several months or even years in some cases. IgM can also be negative at the time of fetal hydrops if the seroconversion occurred several weeks earlier. Various tests may distinguish between IgG and IgM and may allow diagnosis in one serum sample, but biological and technical difficulties are common and may cause false-positive and false-negative results.</p></div>
