<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A study demonstrated that long-term use of venous catheters for hemodialysis (HD) access is associated with greater morbidity and higher mortality. Whereas catheters have the advantage of immediate use without need for maturation time, as enumerated in the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines (2006), the long-term use of catheters is associated with substantially higher rates of infection-related complications and increased risk for central venous thrombosis, stenosis, and occlusion. Also, patients receiving dialysis using catheters have greater mortality risk than patients dialyzed with fistulas, whether or not diabetes mellitus was present. Higher case-mix adjusted mortality rates have been seen for HD patients dialyzing in facilities having greater catheter use.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing </strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility level monthly and annual performance scores. They assessed reliability by calculating inter-unit reliability (IUR) for each reporting month and the overall 12 months. The monthly based measure was a simple average across individuals in the facility. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based measure, however, is not a simple average and the developer instead estimates the IUR using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. The developer notes that the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. Since this measure is not normally distributed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p>The developer also did a comparison of the data elements used to calculate this measure in order to assess comparability of the calculations using two Medicare data sources. The measure was calculated using Medicare claims and CROWNWeb clinical data. </p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>For reliability the developer calculated the monthly and annual IUR across the 12 reporting months. As explained above, the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. IUR=0.77813 which is high and suggests 78% of variation in the measure is attributed to between facility variation. </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The IUR suggests this measure is reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Validity was assessed using Poisson regression models to measure the association between facility level quintiles of performance scores and the 2013 standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (NQF 0369) and 2013 standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR) (NQF 1463), respectively, both NQF-endorsed measures. Facility-level performance scores were divided into quintiles and the relative risk (RR) of mortality (and hospitalization, separately) was calculated for each quintile. The fifth quintile was used as the reference group. Thus, a RR greater than 1.0 for the lower performance score quintiles would indicate a higher relative risk of mortality or hospitalization. </p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Quintiles of the performance scores were defined as follows: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Q1: 0.0% to less than 4.2% </li>
    <li>Q2: 4.2% to less than 7.0% </li>
    <li>Q3: 7.0% to less than 9.7% </li>
    <li>Q4: 9.7% to less than 13.6% </li>
    <li>Q5: 13.6% to less than 60.6% </li>
</ul>
<p>Results from the Poisson model indicated that the percent of patient-months dialyzing with a catheter greater than or equal to 90 days was significantly associated with both SMR (p less than 0.0001) and SHR (p less than 0.0001). For 2013 SMR, relative risk of mortality was the lowest in the lowest performance measure quintile (RR=0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86, 0.91). For quintile 2, RR=0.92 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.94), quintile 3, RR=0.92 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.94) and was 0.94 for quintile 4 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.96). </p>
<p>Similarly for 2013 SHR, the relative risk of hospitalization increased as the performance measure quintile increased from quintile 1. For quintile 1, RR=0.82 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.82), quintile 2, RR=0.89 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.90), quintile 3, RR=0.92 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.92) and was 0.95 for quintile 4 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.95). </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>These results of the Poisson regression suggest the predictive relationship of lower catheter use with lower mortality and hospitalization, as measured by the respective standardized mortality and hospitalization rates, compared to facilities with higher catheter use (greater than or equal to 90 days). </p></div>
