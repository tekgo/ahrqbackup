<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the categories of task force recommendations and evidence (<strong>recommended</strong>, <strong>recommended against</strong>, or <strong>insufficient evidence</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Task Force Findings</span></strong></p>
<p>The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends team-based care to improve blood pressure (BP)&nbsp;control on the basis of strong evidence of effectiveness in improving the proportion of patients with controlled BP and reducing systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). Evidence was considered <strong>strong</strong> based on findings from 80 studies of team-based care organized primarily with nurses and pharmacists working in collaboration with primary care providers, other professionals, and patients. The economic evidence indicates that team-based care is cost effective.</p>
<p>A summary of the Task Force finding and rationale is available at <a href="http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/teambasedcare.html" title="Community Guide Web site">www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/teambased care.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Categories of Task Force Recommendations and Findings</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force uses the terms below to describe its findings.</p>
<p><em>Recommended</em></p>
<p>The systematic review of available studies provides strong or sufficient evidence that the intervention is effective.</p>
<p>The categories of "strong" and "sufficient" evidence reflect the Task Force's degree of confidence that an intervention has beneficial effects. They do not directly relate to the expected magnitude of benefits. The categorization is based on several factors, such as study design, number of studies, and consistency of the effect across studies.</p>
<p><em>Recommended Against</em></p>
<p>The systematic review of available studies provides strong or sufficient evidence that the intervention is harmful or not effective.</p>
<p><em>Insufficient Evidence</em></p>
<p>The available studies do not provide sufficient evidence to determine if the intervention is, or is not, effective. This does NOT mean that the intervention does not work. It means that additional research is needed to determine whether or not the intervention is effective.</p>
<p>Task Force findings may include a rationale statement that explains why they made a recommendation or arrived at other conclusions.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Task Force finding is based on evidence from a Community Guide systematic review (52 studies; search period, July 2003-May 2012) published in 2014 and a previous systematic review published in 2006 (28 studies; search period, January 1980&ndash;July 2003), in which the conceptual approach and methods matched those of the Community Guide review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effectiveness Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Search for Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The search for evidence consisted of two steps. Step 1 involved locating existing systematic reviews on team-based care for blood pressure (BP) control. Although multiple high-quality systematic reviews on this topic were identified, the systematic review by Walsh and colleagues (2006) had a conceptualization and methods similar to the Community Guide approach. Further, the scope adopted for the Walsh review reflected the team's goal of examining the effectiveness of team-based care from a population health perspective. The literature search from this prior review ended in July 2003. Step 2 consisted of an updated search adopting the Walsh review's search terms and databases. This Community Guide update covered the period from July 2003 to May 2012. The complete search strategy is available at <a href="http://www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/supportingmaterials/SS-team-based-care.html" title="Community Guide Web site">www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/supportingmaterials/SS-team-based-care.html</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Studies were included if they</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Met the definition of team-based care as described in the conceptual framework </li>
    <li>Were in English </li>
    <li>Were not in the Walsh et al. review </li>
    <li>Were conducted in a high-income economy consistent with Community Guide methods </li>
    <li>Reported at least one BP outcome of interest (i.e., proportion of patients with controlled BP, reduction in systolic BP [SBP], or reduction in diastolic BP [DBP]) </li>
    <li>Included a comparison group or had an interrupted time-series design with at least two measurements before and after the intervention </li>
    <li>Targeted populations with primary hypertension or populations with comorbid conditions such as diabetes as long as the primary focus of the intervention was BP control </li>
    <li>Did not include populations with secondary hypertension (e.g., pregnancy) or with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (e.g., myocardial infarction) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The economic review is based on evidence from the Community Guide search for effectiveness evidence (search period January 1980&ndash;May 2012) and an earlier search for economic evidence conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP) (search period January 1985&ndash;March 2011).</p>
<p>The DHDSP review searched eight bibliographic databases: Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EconLit, Socio Abs, Web of Science, and Cochrane. The types of documents retrieved by the search included journal articles, books, book chapters, reports, and conference papers.</p>
<p>Search terms and strategies were adjusted to each database, based on controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies and search software.</p>

<p><strong>Data Abstraction and Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Each study included in the current review was evaluated independently by two reviewers. Abstraction was based on the standard Community Guide process (<a href="http://www.thecommunityguide.org/methods/abstractionform.pdf" title="Community Guide Web site">www.thecommunityguide.org/methods/abstractionform.pdf</a>). Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus.</p>
<p>Using Community Guide methods, each study was assessed for threats to internal and external validity. Threats to validity&mdash;such as poor descriptions of the intervention, population, sampling frame, and inclusion/exclusion criteria; poor measurement of exposure or outcome; lack of appropriate analytic methods; incomplete data sets; high attrition; or intervention and comparison groups not being comparable at baseline&mdash;were used to characterize studies as having good (0&ndash;1 limitations); fair (2&ndash;4); or limited (&gt;4) quality of execution. Studies judged to be of limited quality of execution were excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>Conclusions on the strength of evidence on effectiveness are based on evidence from both reviews (Walsh and colleagues and this Community Guide update), taking into account the number of studies, quality of available evidence, consistency of results, magnitude of effect estimates, and applicability considerations.</p>
<p>Evidence tables are available (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A separate systematic review examining the economic evidence (31 studies; search period, January 1980&ndash;May 2012) found most cost-effectiveness estimates to be below the conservative threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. This suggests that implementation of team-based care for blood pressure (BP) control is cost-effective.

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considerations for Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>The team-based care model is the essence of the shifting paradigm of U.S. healthcare delivery to an approach that is more coordinated and integrated. Central to this approach is organizing care around the patient with the support of multiple providers. Team members who worked with patients and primary care providers in the studies included in the systematic review were most frequently nurses and pharmacists. There were larger improvements in the proportion of patients achieving blood pressure (BP) control when pharmacists were included in the team, whereas reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were similar to overall estimates when either nurses or pharmacists were part of the team. Involvement of additional team members related to medication management (e.g., pharmacists and nurses) was conceptualized in three levels. Team-based care models in which team members could make changes to medications independent of the patient's primary care provider or make suggestions for medication changes to the primary care provider based on evidence-based clinical protocols achieved larger improvements in BP outcomes than those that only provided education on hypertension and support for medication adherence to patients.</p>
<p>Moreover, the improvement in outcomes for common comorbidities such as diabetes and cholesterol using team-based care suggest the great potential for applying this approach to managing chronic disease. Studies that used team-based care for comprehensive cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction most commonly employed nurse practitioners to work with primary care providers and patients to both manage patient medications and provide vital self-management support.</p>
<p>With the advent of the Patient-Centered Medical Home and accountable care organizations, many health systems are looking to implement value-based models of chronic care&mdash;where reimbursement is tied to improvements in health outcomes for entire panels of patients. At the center of this systems-level organizational change are models like team-based care that improve the efficiency, quality, and value of care.</p>
<p>Health systems will need to consider the needs of their patients and resources at their disposal when establishing team-based care to manage CVD risk factors. Clear decisions about team constitution and team member roles as well as reimbursement mechanisms are needed. Activities to foster team building and achieve provider buy-in could prove invaluable. Training resources for providers need to provide orientation and exposure to skills necessary to address multiple CVD risk factors while working with a team that includes the patient. Screening and proactive follow-up processes, as well as access to self-management resources including tools such as BP home monitors, seem to facilitate the success of team-based care. Support for self-management includes developing patient knowledge and skills as well as improving patient attitudes and health behavior aimed at addressing high BP and related risk factors.</p>
<p>The arrival of new technologies presents many opportunities to further harness the potential of team-based care. Various modalities (e.g., Web-based, app-based, text message&ndash;based, and electronic health records) could serve to improve communication between providers and patients, clinical decisions by providers, and patient support.</p></div>
