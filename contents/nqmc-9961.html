Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of Medicare patients 65 years of age and older who have evidence of an underlying disease, condition or health concern and who were dispensed an ambulatory prescription for a potentially harmful medication, concurrent with or after the diagnosis. </p>
<p>Report each of the three rates separately and as a total rate.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A history of falls and a prescription for anticonvulsants, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antiemetics, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants </li>
    <li>Dementia and a prescription for antiemetics, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, H2 receptor antagonists, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics or anticholinergic agents </li>
    <li>Chronic kidney disease and prescription for cyclo-oxygenase (Cox)-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or nonasprin NSAIDs </li>
    <li>Total rate (the sum of the three numerators divided by the sum of the three denominators) </li>
</ul>
<p>This measure summary represents the total rate. </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Patients with more than one disease or condition may appear in the measure multiple times (i.e., in each indicator for which they qualify).</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Pharmacotherapy is an essential component of medical treatment for older patients, but medications are also responsible for many adverse events in this group. Almost 90 percent of people 65 and older take at least one medication, significantly more than any other age group (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 1996). Patient safety is highly important to member health, especially patients who are at increased risk of adverse drug events due to coexisting conditions and polypharmacy. Adverse drug events have been linked to preventable problems in elderly patients, such as depression, constipation, falls, immobility, confusion and hip fractures. Thirty percent of elderly-patient hospital admissions may be linked to drug-related problems or toxic effects (Hanlon et al., 1997). </p>
<p>Drug-disease interactions identified for reporting in this measure are based on the literature and on the key clinical expert consensus process by Beers that identified potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults with specific diagnoses or conditions. The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) medication management expert panel provided advice on the conditions and drugs to be included in this measure, based on the updated Beers list and a Canadian panel and significance of harm and impact on the older adult population (Fick et al., 2003).</p></div>
