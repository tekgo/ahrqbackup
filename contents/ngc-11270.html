<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The recommendation grades (<strong>A-C, Good Practice Point [GPP]</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quick Starting if Pregnancy Can Be Excluded</strong></span></p>
<p>Healthcare practitioners (HCPs) can offer quick start of any method of contraception at any time in the menstrual cycle if it is reasonably certain that a woman is not pregnant or at risk of pregnancy from recent unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI). (<strong>GPP</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quick Starting if Pregnancy Cannot Be Excluded</strong></span> </p>
<p>Women who have a negative high-sensitivity urine pregnancy test (HSUP) (able to detect human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] levels around 20 mIU/ml) but are at risk of pregnancy from recent UPSI should be advised that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Pregnancy cannot be excluded by an HSUP until &ge;21 days after the last UPSI. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Emergency contraception (EC) may be indicated. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>Combined hormonal contraception (CHC), progestogen-only pill (POP) and progestogen-only implant (IMP) can be quick started if they prefer not to delay starting contraception. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) may be considered if other methods are not suitable or acceptable. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>The levonorgestrel intrauterine system should not generally be quick started unless pregnancy can be reasonably excluded. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>CHC containing cyproterone acetate should not be quick started unless pregnancy can be reasonably excluded. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>A copper intrauterine device can be quick started only if the indications for use as EC are met. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>After levonorgestrel EC (LNG-EC) administration, CHC, POP, IMP (and DMPA) can be quick started immediately. (<strong>Grade D</strong>) </li>
    <li>After ulipristal acetate EC (UPA-EC) administration, they should wait 5 days before quick starting suitable hormonal contraception (CHC, POP, IMP [and DMPA]). (<strong>Grade D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Additional contraceptive precautions (barrier or abstinence) are required until the quick started contraceptive method becomes effective. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>A follow-up HSUP is required no sooner than 21 days after the last UPSI. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use of Bridging Contraception</strong></p>
<p>If a woman's choice of contraceptive method is not available or is not appropriate at the time of presentation, she should be offered a bridging method of contraception that can be quick started. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pregnancy Diagnosed After Quick Starting Contraception</strong></span></p>
<p>The guideline development group advises that women should be informed that contraceptive hormones are not thought to cause harm to the fetus and they should not be advised to terminate pregnancy on the grounds of exposure. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Women Using CHC, POP, IMP or DMPA</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Women Who Wish to Continue the Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>If a pregnancy is diagnosed after starting contraception and the woman wishes to continue the pregnancy, the woman should be advised that the method should usually be removed or stopped. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Women Who Choose Not to Continue the Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>If a pregnancy is diagnosed after starting CHC, POP, IMP or DMPA and the woman chooses therapeutic abortion:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A woman using IMP or DMPA can be advised to continue her method of contraception with no additional contraceptive precautions after abortion. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>A woman using CHC or POP can be advised to stop her method of contraception and restart contraception immediately after abortion with no additional contraceptive precautions. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>A woman using DMPA should be advised that there may be a slightly higher risk of continuing pregnancy (failed abortion) if DMPA is administered at the time of mifepristone administration. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Women Using IUC</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>HCPs should advise women whose intrauterine pregnancy is less than 12 weeks' gestation that intrauterine contraception (IUC) should be removed, as long as the threads are visible or it can be easily removed from the endocervical canal. This is regardless of whether the woman decides to continue with the pregnancy. (<strong>GPP</strong>) </li>
    <li>HCPs should explain to women who have an intrauterine pregnancy with an IUC <em>in situ</em> that the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes is greater than that for pregnancies without an IUC <em>in situ</em>. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>HCPs should advise women who have an intrauterine pregnancy with an IUC <em>in situ</em> that removal of the IUC in the first trimester could improve pregnancy outcomes, but is associated with a small risk of miscarriage. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grading of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: At least one systematic review, meta-analysis or randomised controlled trial (RCT) rated as 1++, and directly applicable to the target population; <em>or </em>a systematic review of RCTs or a body of evidence consisting principally of studies rated as 1+, directly applicable to the target population and demonstrating overall consistency of results.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>: A body of evidence including studies rated as 2++ directly applicable to the target population and demonstrating overall consistency of results; <em>or </em>extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 1++ or 1+.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: A body of evidence including studies rated as 2+ directly applicable to the target population and demonstrating overall consistency of results; <em>or </em>extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2++.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>: Evidence level 3 or 4; or extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2+.</p>
<p><strong>Good Practice Point</strong>: Good Practice Points based on the clinical experience of the guideline development group.*</p>
<p class="Note">*On the occasion when the GDG finds there is an important practical point that they wish to emphasise but for which there is not, nor is there likely to be, any research evidence. This will typically be where some aspect of treatment is regarded as such sound clinical practice that nobody is likely to question it. It must be emphasised that these are NOT an alternative to evidence-based recommendations, and should only be used where there is no alternative means of highlighting the issue.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Systematic Review of Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p>A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify evidence to answer the clinical questions formulated and agreed by the guideline development group (GDG). Searches were performed using relevant medical subject headings and free-text terms using the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and POPLINE&reg;. Further, the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) were also used to identify relevant guidelines produced by other organisations; these guidelines were checked to identify missing evidence. No language restrictions were applied to the searches.</p>
<p><strong>Search Date</strong></p>
<p>The databases were initially searched up to 28 November 2016. The evidence identified up to this point was used to develop the first draft of the guideline. Any evidence published after this date was not considered for inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The literature search was performed separately for the different sub-categories covered in this clinical guideline. The search terms used are listed in Appendix 1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Articles identified from the search were screened by title and abstract and full-text copies were obtained if the articles addressed the clinical questions relevant to the guideline. A full critical appraisal of each article was conducted. Studies that did not report relevant outcomes or were not relevant to the clinical questions were excluded.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who Has Developed the Guideline?</span></strong></p>
<p>Development of the guideline was led by the secretariat (Clinical Effectiveness Unit [CEU] staff) and involved the intended users of the guidelines (contraception providers) and patient/service user representatives as part of a multidisciplinary group. The scope of the guideline was informed by a scoping survey conducted amongst members of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) and amongst service users from three sexual and reproductive health services across the United Kingdom (UK) (Sandyford [Glasgow], Scotland; Brook [Liverpool &amp; Wirral and Milton Keynes], England; Aneurin Bevan University Health Board [Gwent], Wales). The first draft of the guideline was produced based on the final scope of the guideline agreed by the guideline development group (GDG). The first draft of the guideline (version 0.1) was reviewed by the GDG and a revised draft guideline (version 0.2) was produced in response to comments received.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>This FSRH guideline was developed in accordance with the standard methodology for developing FSRH clinical guidelines (outlined in the FSRH's <em>Framework for Clinical Guideline Development</em> [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The methodology used in the development of this guideline has been accredited by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considerations When Making Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>FSRH clinical guidelines are produced primarily to recommend safe and appropriate clinical practice in relation to the provision of different contraceptive methods. Therefore, when formulating the recommendations, the GDG takes into consideration the health benefits, side effects and other risks associated with implementing the recommendations, based on the available evidence and expert opinion. Further, the GDG takes into consideration the different financial and organisational barriers that clinicians and services may face in the implementation of recommendations to ensure that the recommendations are realistic and achievable.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reaching Consensus on the Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>When further revisions based on public consultation feedback have been made, members of the GDG were asked to complete a form to indicate whether they agree or disagree with the recommendations proposed. The consensus process is as follows: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Consensus will be reached when 80% of the GDG members agree with the recommendation. </li>
    <li>Recommendations where consensus is not reached will be redrafted in light of any feedback. </li>
    <li>The recommendation consensus form will be sent again for all recommendations. Consensus will be reached when 80% of the GDG members agree with the recommendation. </li>
    <li>If consensus is not reached on certain recommendations, these will be redrafted once more. </li>
    <li>If after one more round of consultation, consensus is still not reached, the recommendation will be taken to the CEC for final decision. </li>
    <li>Any group member who is not content with the decision can choose to have their disagreement noted within the guideline. </li>
</ul></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quick starting contraception, as opposed to waiting for the next menstrual period, could reduce a woman's risk of unintended pregnancy by facilitating immediate initiation of effective contraception. </li>
    <li>Quick starting could:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Reduce the time during which a woman is at risk of pregnancy. Women who have taken emergency contraception (EC) or who have irregular cycles could have an even longer wait until onset of their next menstrual period. </li>
        <li>Prevent a woman from forgetting information on correct usage of her contraception. Avoid waning enthusiasm for the method and use of a less reliable alternative method. </li>
        <li>Avoid costs of, and barriers to, returning for contraception (e.g., transport, time, childcare). </li>
        <li>Reduce health care costs by reducing the number of appointments needed. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>When quick starting contraception there will sometimes be a small risk that the woman is already pregnant or that emergency contraception (EC) will fail and she will conceive from recent unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI). Diagnosis of pregnancy may be delayed if amenorrhoea is assumed to be due to the contraceptive method or if bleeding associated with the contraception is mistaken for a period. There are also theoretical concerns that hormonal contraception (HC) could be harmful to the fetus. See Section 4 in the original guideline document for additional information.</li>
    <li>A systematic review of observational studies found that women who conceived with an intrauterine device (IUD) <em>in situ </em>were at a greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery compared with women who conceived without an IUD <em>in situ</em>. </li>
    <li>Because of the increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Section 7.2 in the original guideline document) intrauterine contraception (IUC) should not be quick started unless pregnancy has been reasonably excluded or a woman meets the criteria for use of the copper (Cu) IUD for EC. </li>
    <li>Removal of IUC in the first trimester is thought to reduce the overall risk of adverse outcomes but is associated with a small risk of miscarriage. </li>
</ul>
