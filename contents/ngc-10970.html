<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formulation of Focused Clinical Questions</span></strong></p>
<p>The participants formulated clinically pertinent focused statements related to the detection and management of dysplasia in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and framed each statement in terms of population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Literature Search</span></strong> </p>
<p>A systematic literature search of multiple bibliographic databases (EMBASE 1980 to 2013 Week 38; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 1898 to August 2013; Ovid MEDLINE, 1946 to present, in-process and other non-indexed citations, and daily update September 24, 2013) was performed for each focused statement by the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal Pancreatic Diseases Review Group. Additional searches from major gastroenterology scientific meetings (e.g., Digestive Disease Week, American College of Gastroenterology, United European Gastroenterology Week) for 2009-2013 and of reference lists from selected articles were also performed (see the figure in the original guideline document). The search strategy keywords were framed for the PICO-formatted focused clinical statements (see Appendix 3 in original guideline document). The search was limited to human studies without any language restriction. Two reviewers performed the initial title and abstract review, review of full-text articles for inclusion, and data extraction independently. Following full text review and article selection, a third person adjudicated any discrepancies.</p>
<p>By using pre-specified criteria, the guideline group excluded abstracts/articles when (1) the population did not include colonic inflammatory bowel disease; (2) the intervention or comparator did not include sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy for the detection, diagnosis or management of colorectal neoplasia, dysplasia or early cancer; (3) the outcome did not include colorectal neoplasia, dysplasia or cancer-related detection, incidence or mortality; (4) the article type was a case report or series; (5) the article contained duplicate data; (6) the article had relevant missing data that could not be obtained despite attempts to contact corresponding authors; (7) the author had articles on the topic retracted from the literature; and (8) the studies included data from the fiberoptic endoscope era (predating 1990).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Meta-analyses</strong></span> </p>
<p>Risk of bias for individual studies was assessed independently by two reviewers with the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool for observational diagnostic studies and a modified Jadad score (one point added if allocation was concealed) for randomized trials; a third person adjudicated any discrepancies. The quality of the evidence for each statement was rated by two reviewers independently as very low quality, low quality, moderate quality, and high quality based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology; disagreements were resolved by discussion (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>
<p>Meta-analyses were performed when multiple studies relevant to a focused question were found and could be appropriately pooled. The guideline group used a fixed effect model, except in cases of significant heterogeneity when it used a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model. The guideline group used the Cochran Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic to assess heterogeneity. Significant heterogeneity was defined as a <em>P</em> &lt;.10 for the Cochran Q test or I<sup>2</sup> statistic &gt;50%. The guideline group performed the data analysis by using the Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 2.2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ) statistical package.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development Panel</span></strong></p>
<p>A 5-member executive committee of content experts, general gastroenterologists, and methodologists oversaw the development process. The executive committee selected a multidisciplinary panel to represent a wide spectrum of stakeholders in the diagnosis and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to provide international viewpoints. This 21-member panel included IBD experts, general gastroenterologists, advanced endoscopists, methodologists, pathologists, a surgeon, an advanced practice IBD nurse, and a patient representative from an IBD non-profit organization. Representation from a wide spectrum of stakeholders and attitudes toward the detection and management of dysplasia in IBD was emphasized. An additional 8 non-voting physicians, chosen for their expertise in areas such as endoscopic techniques or guideline dissemination/ implementation, attended the meeting to provide information as requested by voting panelists. The list of participants is provided in Appendix 1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consensus Process for Development of Recommendations</span> </strong></p>
<p>The guideline group deployed an online consensus platform to facilitate most aspects of the consensus process. The panel received evidence reports for each statement. Two rounds of voting on level of agreement with the statements were conducted by using the online platform prior to a face-to-face meeting of all participants to determine consensus on the recommendations. Modifications to the wording of the statements were made as needed in response to the participants' comments after each round of voting. </p>
<p>The guideline group held a one and a half-day consensus conference in March 2014, where data were presented, wording of the statements was discussed and finalized, and participants voted on their level of agreement by using a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree). They defined the criterion for accepting a statement as a recommendation as &ge;80% of participants voting 4 (agree) or 5 (strongly agree). If a panel member was absent or did not vote at the time of a vote, the denominator of panelists who were present and voted was used. Once a recommendation was accepted, panelists voted on whether to label the recommendation as strong or conditional according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Wording of recommendations was based on the strength of recommendation: <em>recommend </em>was used for strong recommendations, and <em>suggest </em>was used for conditional recommendations. Voting percentages for individual statements could vary based on the number of voting members in attendance at the time of voting on the statement. The executive committee drafted the manuscript, which was then reviewed by the voting panel members and also by the 8 non-voting physicians with expertise in areas including IBD and advanced endoscopic imaging techniques who had attended the guideline meeting to provide information to panelists. The manuscript was revised based on these comments and approved by the participants. Additional revisions for clarity and description were made in response to comments from the peer review process.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>An economic analysis concluded that chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies was less costly and more effective than white-light colonoscopy with random biopsies, suggesting that chromoendoscopy should be used in place of white-light endoscopy when surveillance colonoscopy is performed. The cost-effectiveness of chromoendoscopy increased with increasing surveillance interval, suggesting that varying the surveillance interval based on the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) may be appropriate and could increase the cost-effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation of High-Quality Endoscopic Surveillance</span></strong></p>
<p>Widespread implementation of high-quality endoscopic surveillance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will require a variety of initiatives, which will be discussed in a separate publication. Resources will be needed to train endoscopists in endoscopic surveillance and recognition of visible dysplasia with both white-light endoscopy and chromoendoscopy. These may include training courses, photographic atlases, and video repositories. Quality metrics and methods to document acceptable performance quality also should be developed. In addition, techniques such as chromoendoscopy should be standardized to allow implementation in endoscopy units, and endoscopic resection techniques for nonpolypoid lesions should be taught and disseminated. Development of a procedure code for chromoendoscopy and reimbursement for the increased time and intensity required for chromoendoscopy would increase implementation, at least in the United States.</p></div>

Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ethics</span></strong></p>
<p>An ethics consultant without personal or other conflicts of interest (COI) and an ad hoc ethics advisory committee developed and implemented an ethics framework and distributed it to all participants, with set policies for declarations of interest. Mandatory written disclosures of financial conflicts of interests within 24 months before the meeting and of non-financial conflicts of interest were obtained a priori from all participants. Financial conflicts were disclosed to the entire group and included in conference materials. All potential COIs were reviewed and resolved through proportionality: depending on the judged extent of the COI by the ad hoc ethics committee, resolution was achieved through disclosure for minor COIs and recusal in the case of major COIs. No statement of related COI was deemed to be at such a high risk that recusal was required for any participant. Further information regarding disclosures is provided in Appendix 1 of the original guideline document.</p>
