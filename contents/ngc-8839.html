Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>In patients with suspected transverse myelitis (TM), distinction between acute complete transverse myelitis (ACTM) or acute partial transverse myelitis (APTM) may be considered useful to determine the etiology of TM and the risk for relapse (more common in APTM) (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>Age and gender may be considered useful to determine etiology in a patient presenting with TM syndrome, with spinal infarcts seen more often in older patients and more female than male patients having TM due to multiple sclerosis (MS) (<strong>Level C</strong>). Due to considerable overlap between groups, patient demographic characteristics are not definitive in establishing the cause of myelopathy.</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of ethnicity to determine the cause of a subacute myelopathy (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics consistent with those of MS may be considered useful to predict conversion to MS after a first episode of partial TM (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>Longer spinal lesions extending over more than 3 vertebral segments may be considered useful in determining neuromyelitis optica (NMO) vs MS (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>NMO-immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies should be considered useful to determine the cause of TM in patients presenting with clinical features of ACTM (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination for cells and oligoclonal bands (OCBs) may be considered useful to determine the cause of the TM syndrome (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>The presence of NMO-IgG antibodies (aquaporin-4&ndash;specific antibodies) should be considered useful in determining an increased risk of TM recurrence (<strong>Level B</strong>).</p>
<p>Plasma exchange may be considered in patients with TM who fail to improve after corticosteroid treatment (<strong>Level C</strong>). Rituximab may be considered in patients with TM due to NMO to decrease the number of relapses (<strong>Level C</strong>). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of other therapies (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The strength of practice recommendations is linked directly to the level of evidence:</p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Therapeutic Interventions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p>The following are also required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for dropouts (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and crossovers with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias. </li>
    <li>For noninferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or non-inferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the results of the study is based upon a per protocol analysis that takes into account dropouts or crossovers. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A randomized controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a&ndash;e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b&ndash;e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.**</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus or expert opinion.</p>
<p class="Note">*Note that numbers 1&ndash;3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.<br />
**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Diagnostic Tests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study where a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data was collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Prognostic Articles</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who did not determine the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of a prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p></div>

<p>The guideline sought to answer the following questions regarding patients with myelopathy: which demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory features are useful:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>To distinguish transverse myelitis (TM) from other causes of acute and subacute noncompressive myelopathy? </li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
    <li>Alleviate acute attacks? </li>
    <li>Prevent future attacks? </li>
</ol>
<p>A literature search of Medline was performed for relevant articles published from 1966 to March 2009, using the following key words: myelitis, transverse myelitis, Devic disease, neuromyelitis optica, diagnosis, prognosis, outcomes, MRI, and treatments. The search was limited to reports in humans and abstracts available in English. Subheadings were applied as appropriate. The exact search strategy employed is described in Appendix e-1 of the Data Supplement in the original guideline document. A secondary search of review articles was done to find any missed citations.</p>
<p>The guideline developers reviewed all abstracts; the full text of potentially relevant articles was subsequently reviewed by at least 2 committee members. The guideline developers excluded review articles and case reports.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline developer searched Medline for studies published between January 2013 to January 2015, using the following search strategy: myelitis, transverse myelitis, Devic disease, neuromyelitis optica, diagnosis, prognosis, outcomes, MRI, and treatments. Inclusion criteria were humans only, relevant to clinical questions; exclusion criteria used to screen search results were the same as described in the 2011 published guideline.</p></div>

There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists.</p></div>

Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least three AAN committees, a network of neurologists, <em>Neurology</em> peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields.
