Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The CAHPS Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Survey, Adult Version provides information on patients' experience with practices and gives a general indication of how well a practice meets patient expectations. Results summarize patient experience with care through an overall rating question, composites and question summary rates. </p>
<p>For this "Communication" measure, adult patients reported how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") their provider communicated well. The "Communication" composite measure is based on six questions in the CAHPS PCMH Survey, Adult Version: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Q19</strong>: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider explain things in a way that was easy to understand? </li>
    <li><strong>Q20</strong>: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider listen carefully to you? </li>
    <li><strong>Q22</strong>: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider give you easy to understand information about these health questions or concerns? </li>
    <li><strong>Q23</strong>: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider seem to know the important information about your medical history? </li>
    <li><strong>Q24</strong>: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider show respect for what you had to say? </li>
    <li><strong>Q25</strong>: In the last 12 months, how often did this provider spend enough time with you? </li>
</ul></div>

Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcome&mdash;and that experience is itself a measure of outcome.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) worked with the CAHPS Consortium to incorporate input from the Technical Expert Panel (TEP) and the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Advisory Committee on survey content and proposed domains. We identified a list of topics and potential items (often drawn from existing surveys) and included these items in the PCMH 2011 call for public comment. We also worked with the CAHPS Consortium to develop new items. The CAHPS Consortium conducted focus groups and cognitive testing in English and Spanish, with adult patients and parents of pediatric patients, and included patients in both medical home practices and in primary care practices not categorized as medical homes. </p>
<p>In fall 2010, the CAHPS Consortium conducted cognitive testing of the CAHPS PCMH Survey. Following this, NCQA conducted a field-test of draft versions of both the adult and child CAHPS PCMH Surveys. The field-test survey included 115 items. In several cases, we included items from existing surveys and new items addressing the same content, using CAHPS principles to maintain a level of question standardization. </p>
<p>After reviewing the results of the field-test, the CAHPS Consortium recommended a 58-item adult questionnaire and a 67-item child questionnaire, both including the Clinician &amp; Group core questions and new PCMH items, and representing a 50 percent reduction in length from the survey prepared for the field-test. </p>
<p>NCQA held a public comment period in June 2011 to elicit feedback from stakeholders. After considering comments, the questionnaires and survey methodology were finalized, consistent with the information in this publication. </p></div>
