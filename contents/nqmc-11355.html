<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the time (in minutes) from emergency department (ED) arrival to electrocardiogram (ECG) (performed in the ED prior to transfer) for patients 18 years and older with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or chest pain.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Guidelines recommend patients presenting with chest discomfort or symptoms suggestive of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed within a target of 10 minutes of emergency department (ED) arrival (Krumholz et al., 2008). Evidence supports reperfusion benefits patients with identified STEMI (Antman et al., 2008). The diagnosis and management of STEMI patients is dependent upon practices within the ED. Timely ECGs assist in identifying STEMI patients and impact the choice of reperfusion strategy (Peacock et al., 2007). This measure will identify the median time to ECG for chest pain or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and potential opportunities for improvement to decrease the median time to ECG.</p></div>
