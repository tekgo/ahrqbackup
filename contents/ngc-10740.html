<div class="content_para"><p><em><strong>Note from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: In addition to these evidence-based recommendations, the Guideline Development Group also identifies points of best clinical practice in the full-text guideline document.</em></p>
<p>The grades of recommendations (<strong>strong</strong>, <strong>conditional</strong>) and levels of evidence (<strong>1++</strong>, <strong>1+</strong>, <strong>1-</strong>, <strong>2++</strong>, <strong>2+</strong>, <strong>2-</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, <strong>4</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Identifying High-Risk Tumours</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong></p>
<p><em>Immune Status</em></p>
<p>Immunosuppression should be considered a high-risk clinical feature in patients with primary squamous cell (SCC) carcinoma.</p>
<p><em>Tumour Site</em></p>
<p>The ear should be considered the highest risk tumour site in patients with primary SCC.</p>
<p><em>Maximum Clinical Diameter</em></p>
<p>Clinically determined horizontal tumour diameter of &gt;20 mm should be considered a high-risk feature in patients with primary SCC.</p>
<p><strong>Pathological Features</strong></p>
<p><em>Tumour Depth/Level of Invasion</em></p>
<p>Tumour depth &gt;4 mm should be considered a high-risk feature in patients with primary SCC with depth &gt;6 mm indicating a very high-risk tumour.</p>
<p>Tumour extension beyond the dermis into or through subcutaneous fat should be considered a high-risk feature in patients with primary SCC.</p>
<p><em>Maximum Tumour Diameter</em></p>
<p>Tumour horizontal diameter of &gt;20 mm should be considered a high-risk feature in patients with primary SCC.</p>
<p><em>Perineural Invasion</em></p>
<p>Perineural invasion should be considered a high-risk feature in patients with primary SSC.</p>
<p><em>Tumour Subtype</em></p>
<p>Desmoplastic subtype should be considered a high-risk feature in patients with primary SSC.</p>
<p><em>Differentiation</em></p>
<p>Poorly-differentiated tumour status should be considered a high-risk feature in patients with primary SCC.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral to the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)</span></strong></p>
<p>Where any of the following high-risk features are present, patients with primary SCC should be discussed at a skin cancer MDT meeting:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>SCC arising on the ear </li>
    <li>Tumour diameter &gt;20 mm </li>
    <li>Tumour thickness &gt;4 mm </li>
    <li>Tumour extension beyond dermis into or through subcutaneous fat </li>
    <li>Perineural invasion </li>
    <li>Poorly differentiated </li>
    <li>Desmoplastic subtype </li>
    <li>Immunosuppression </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therapeutic Interventions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Surgical Techniques</strong></p>
<p><em>Standard Surgical Excision</em></p>
<p>For high-risk tumours a clinical peripheral margin of 6 mm or greater is indicated, where surgically achievable and clinically appropriate.</p>
<p>For low-risk tumours a clinical peripheral margin of 4 mm or greater is indicated where surgically achievable and clinically appropriate.</p>
<p><em>Mohs Micrographic Surgery</em></p>
<p>Mohs micrographic surgery should be considered at the MDT, for selected patients with high-risk tumours where tissue preservation or margin control is challenging, and on an individual case basis for patients with any tumour at a critical anatomical site.</p>
<p><strong>Destructive Techniques</strong></p>
<p><em>Curettage and Cautery</em></p>
<p>Curettage and cautery can be considered for patients with low-risk SCCs, if healthcare professionals have had appropriate training with a blunt curette.</p>
<p><em>Photodynamic Therapy</em></p>
<p>Photodynamic therapy should not be used for treatment of primary SSC.</p>
<p><strong>Radiotherapy</strong></p>
<p><em>Primary Radiotherapy</em></p>
<p>Primary radiotherapy should be considered for individual patients where surgical excision would be extremely challenging or difficult to perform or would be likely to result in an unacceptable functional or aesthetic outcome.</p>
<p><em>Adjuvant Radiotherapy</em></p>
<p>Adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered for patients with a high risk of local recurrence or with close or involved margins where further surgery may be associated with increased risk of complications including functional or aesthetic morbidity.</p>
<p><strong>Systemic Retinoids</strong></p>
<p>Selected patients who have developed multiple SCCs following renal transplantation should be considered for low-dose acitretin treatment (10 mg-30 mg/day) for secondary prevention.</p>
<p>Healthcare professionals should be aware that adverse effects are common, are dose related and may lead to dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow Up</span></strong></p>
<p>Patients with SCC with any high-risk features should be offered follow-up appointments every three to six months for 24 months following treatment. One further appointment at three years may be appropriate depending on the clinical risk.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Levels of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>1++</strong>: High quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias</p>
<p><strong>1+</strong>: Well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with a low risk of bias</p>
<p><strong>1-</strong>: Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with a high risk of bias</p>
<p><strong>2++</strong>: High quality systematic reviews of case control or cohort studies</p>
<p>High quality case control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal</p>
<p><strong>2+</strong>: Well-conducted case control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal</p>
<p><strong>2-</strong>: Case control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>: Non-analytic studies (e.g. case reports, case series)</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>: Expert opinion</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the 'strength' of the recommendation).</p>
<p>The 'strength' of a recommendation takes into account the quality (level) of the evidence. Although higher quality evidence is more likely to be associated with strong recommendations than lower quality evidence, a particular level of quality does not automatically lead to a particular strength of recommendation.</p>
<p>Other factors that are taken into account when forming recommendations include: relevance to the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland; applicability of published evidence to the target population; consistency of the body of evidence, and the balance of benefits and harms of the options.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For <strong>'strong'</strong> recommendations on interventions that 'should' be used, the Guideline Development Group is confident that, for the vast majority of people, the intervention (or interventions) will do more good than harm. </li>
    <li>For <strong>'conditional'</strong> recommendations on interventions that should be 'considered', the Guideline Development Group is confident that the intervention will do more good than harm for most patients. The choice of intervention is therefore more likely to vary depending on a person's values and preferences, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time discussing the options with the patient. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence base for this guideline was synthesised in accordance with Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) methodology. A systematic review of the literature was carried out using an explicit search strategy devised by a SIGN Evidence and Information Scientist. Databases searched include Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. The year range covered was 2007-2012. Internet searches were carried out on various Web sites including the U.S. National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC). The main searches were supplemented by material identified by individual members of the development group. Each of the selected papers was evaluated by two members of the group using standard SIGN methodological checklists before conclusions were considered as evidence.</p>
<p>Please refer to the search narrative for further information on the search strategy, including search terms (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search for Patient Issues</span></strong></p>
<p>At the start of the guideline development process, a SIGN Evidence and Information Scientist conducted a literature search for qualitative and quantitative studies that addressed patient issues of relevance to early management of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Databases searched include Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, and the results were summarised by the SIGN Patient Involvement Officer and presented to the Guideline Development Group.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Once papers have been selected as potential sources of evidence, the methodology used in each study is assessed to ensure its validity. The result of this assessment will affect the level of evidence allocated to the paper, which will in turn influence the grade of recommendation that it supports.</p>
<p>The methodological assessment is based on a number of key questions that focus on those aspects of the study design that research has shown to have a significant influence on the validity of the results reported and conclusions drawn. These key questions differ between study types, and a range of checklists is used to bring a degree of consistency to the assessment process. Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has based its assessments on the MERGE (Method for Evaluating Research and Guideline Evidence) checklists developed by the New South Wales Department of Health, which have been subjected to wide consultation and evaluation. These checklists were subjected to detailed evaluation and adaptation to meet SIGN's requirements for a balance between methodological rigour and practicality of use.</p>
<p>The assessment process inevitably involves a degree of subjective judgement. The extent to which a study meets a particular criterion&mdash;e.g., an acceptable level of loss to follow up&mdash;and, more importantly, the likely impact of this on the reported results from the study will depend on the clinical context. To minimise any potential bias resulting from this, each study must be evaluated independently by at least two group members. Any differences in assessment should then be discussed by the full group. Where differences cannot be resolved, an independent reviewer or an experienced member of SIGN Executive staff will arbitrate to reach an agreed quality assessment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Tables</span></strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables are compiled by SIGN executive staff based on the quality assessments of individual studies provided by Guideline Development Group members. The tables summarise all the validated studies identified from the systematic literature review relating to each key question. They are presented in a standard format to make it easier to compare results across studies, and will present separately the evidence for each outcome measure used in the published studies. These evidence tables form an essential part of the guideline development record and ensure that the basis of the Guideline Development Group's recommendations is transparent.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synthesising the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>Guideline recommendations are graded to differentiate between those based on strong evidence and those based on weak evidence. This judgement is made on the basis of an (objective) assessment of the design and quality of each study and a (perhaps more subjective) judgement on the consistency, clinical relevance and external validity of the whole body of evidence. The aim is to produce a recommendation that is evidence-based, but which is relevant to the way in which health care is delivered in Scotland and is therefore implementable.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the grading does not relate to the importance of the recommendation, but to the strength of the supporting evidence and, in particular, to the predictive power of the study designs from which that data was obtained. Thus, the grading assigned to a recommendation indicates to users the likelihood that, if that recommendation is implemented, the predicted outcome will be achieved.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considered Judgement</span></strong></p>
<p>It is rare for the evidence to show clearly and unambiguously what course of action should be recommended for any given question. Consequently, it is not always clear to those who were not involved in the decision making process how guideline developers were able to arrive at their recommendations, given the evidence they had to base them on. In order to address this problem, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has introduced the concept of considered judgement.</p>
<p>Under the heading of considered judgement, Guideline Development Groups summarise their view of the total body of evidence covered by each evidence table.</p>
<p>Each guideline group considers the following factors:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quantity, quality, and consistency of evidence </li>
    <li>External validity (generalisability) of studies </li>
    <li>Directness of application to the target population for the guideline </li>
    <li>Any evidence of potential harms associated with implementation of a recommendation </li>
    <li>Clinical impact (i.e., the extent of the impact on the target patient population, and the resources needed to treat them in accordance with the recommendation) </li>
    <li>Whether, and to what extent, any equality groups may be particularly advantaged or disadvantaged by the recommendations made </li>
    <li>Implementability (i.e., how practical it would be for the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland to implement the recommendation.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Then the group is asked to summarise its view on all of these issues, both the quality of the evidence and its potential impact, before making a recommendation. This summary should be succinct, and taken together with its views of the level of evidence represent the first draft of the text that will appear in the guideline immediately before a recommendation.</p>
<p>Additional detail about SIGN's process for formulating guideline recommendations is provided in Section 7 of the companion document titled "SIGN 50: A Guideline Developers' Handbook." (Edinburgh [Scotland]: Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.

This judgement should only be arrived at following discussion of the options with the patient, covering the diagnostic and treatment choices available. It is, however, advised that significant departures from the national guideline or any local guidelines derived from it should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken. </li>
    <li>Recommendations within this guideline are based on the best clinical evidence. Some recommendations may be for medicines prescribed outwith the marketing authorisation (MA) also known as product license. This is known as 'off label' use.
    <p>Medicines may be prescribed outwith their product licence in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>For an indication not specified within the marketing authorisation </li>
        <li>For administration via a different route </li>
        <li>For administration of a different dose </li>
        <li>For a different patient population </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An unlicensed medicine is a medicine which does not have MA for medicinal use in humans.</p>
    <p>Generally 'off label' prescribing of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed medicines within the marketing authorisation. Such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and experience.</p>
    <p>"Prescribing medicines outside the conditions of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases) the prescribers' professional responsibility and potential liability."</p>
    <p>The General Medical Council (GMC) recommends that when prescribing a medicine 'off label', doctors should:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Be satisfied that such use would better serve the patient's needs than an authorised alternative (if one exists) </li>
        <li>Be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence/experience of using the medicines to show its safety and efficacy, seeking the necessary information from appropriate sources </li>
        <li>Record in the patient's clinical notes the medicine prescribed and, when not following common practice, the reasons for the choice </li>
        <li>Take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient's care, including monitoring the effects of the medicine </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Non-medical prescribers should ensure that they are familiar with the legislative framework and their own professional prescribing standards.</p>
    <p>Prior to any prescribing, the licensing status of a medication should be checked in the summary of product characteristics (SPC). The prescriber must be competent, operate within the professional code of ethics of their statutory bodies and the prescribing practices of their employers.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Implementation of national clinical guidelines is the responsibility of each National Health Service (NHS) Board and is an essential part of clinical governance. Mechanisms should be in place to review care provided against the guideline recommendations. The reasons for any differences should be assessed and addressed where appropriate. Local arrangements should then be made to implement the national guideline in individual hospitals, units and practices.</p>
<p>Refer to Section 8 in the original guideline document for information on resource implications associated with implementing the key clinical recommendations and advice on audit as a tool to aid implementation.</p></div>
