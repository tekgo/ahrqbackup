<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the classification of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>1-3</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facial Nerve Monitoring</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>Does intraoperative facial nerve monitoring during vestibular schwannoma surgery lead to better long-term facial nerve function?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adult patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma surgery regardless of tumor characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: It is recommended that intraoperative facial nerve monitoring be routinely utilized during vestibular schwannoma surgery to improve long-term facial nerve function.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Can intraoperative facial nerve monitoring be used to accurately predict favorable long-term facial nerve function after vestibular schwannoma surgery?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adult patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring can be used to accurately predict favorable long-term facial nerve function after vestibular schwannoma surgery. Specifically, the presence of favorable testing reliably portends a good long-term facial nerve outcome. However, the absence of favorable testing in the setting of an anatomically intact facial nerve does not reliably predict poor long-term function and therefore cannot be used to direct decision-making regarding the need for early reinnervation procedures.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>Does an anatomically intact facial nerve with poor electromyogram (EMG) electrical responses during intraoperative testing reliably predict poor long-term facial nerve function?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adult patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Poor intraoperative EMG electrical response of the facial nerve should not be used as a reliable predictor of poor long-term facial nerve function.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cochlear Nerve Monitoring</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>Should intraoperative eighth cranial nerve monitoring be used during vestibular schwannoma surgery?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adult patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma surgery with measurable preoperative hearing levels and tumors smaller than 1.5 cm.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: Intraoperative eighth cranial nerve monitoring should be used during vestibular schwannoma surgery when hearing preservation is attempted.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p>Is direct monitoring of the eighth cranial nerve superior to the use of far-field auditory brain stem responses?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to adult patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma surgery with measurable preoperative hearing levels and tumors smaller than 1.5 cm.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><em>Level 3</em>: There is insufficient evidence to make a definitive recommendation.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Process Overview</span></strong></p>
<p>The evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the Tumor Section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the management of vestibular schwannomas (VSs). The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were queried. The keywords used during the search of the medical literature databases cited above are documented in Tables 1 and 2 in the full guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Citations were manually reviewed by the team with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria as outlined below. The duplicates from the search were eliminated. Two independent reviewers reviewed and abstracted full-text data for each article, and the 2 sets of data were compared for agreement by a third party. Inconsistencies were re-reviewed and disagreements were resolved by consensus. The evolution of the article selection is illustrated with flow diagrams (see Figures 1 and 2 in the full guideline). All citations that focused on adult patients and surgical treatment of VSs were broadly considered. For literature to be included for further consideration, papers had to meet the following criteria:</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having vestibular schwannomas </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Was not an in vitro study </li>
    <li>Was not a biomechanical study </li>
    <li>Was not performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014 </li>
    <li>Published in a peer-reviewed journal </li>
    <li>Was not a meeting abstract, editorial, letter, or commentary </li>
    <li>Was published in English </li>
    <li>Included quantitatively presented results </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Used an established facial nerve (FN) function grading system, such as the House&ndash;Brackmann (HB) scale or the Sunnybrook (SB) scale </li>
    <li>Used the 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) or Gardner&ndash;Robertson (GR) hearing classification system OR presented data using word recognition score (WRS) and pure tone average (PTA) for defining hearing status or had individual patient data presented such that the latter criteria could be applied and analyzed </li>
    <li>Included pre- and postoperative audiometric data </li>
    <li>Included a median or mean follow-up of 12 months following treatment when assessing long-term facial outcomes </li>
    <li>Included only studies evaluating intraoperative electrophysiological testing of the facial and cochlear nerves </li>
    <li>Used electrically evoked testing with EMG </li>
    <li>NF status was collected when available but was not an exclusion criterion </li>
</ul>
<p>The authors did not include systematic reviews, guidelines, or meta-analyses conducted by others. These documents were developed using different inclusion criteria than those specified in our guideline. Therefore, they may have included studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria listed above. These documents were recalled if their abstract suggested that they might address one of the recommendations set forth in this guideline. The authors searched their bibliographies for additional studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2014. Three electronic databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the medical librarian using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies (see Tables 1 and 2 in the full guideline).</p>
<p>Searches of electronic databases were supplemented with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. Bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations were also searched. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed above. The guideline committee also examined lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions. The guideline task force went to great lengths to obtain a complete set of relevant articles to ensure guideline recommendations are not based on a biased subset of articles. Two datasets were constructed, one for FN monitoring and another for cochlear nerve monitoring.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classification of Evidence and Guideline Formulation</span></strong></p>
<p>The concept of linking evidence to recommendations has been further formalized by the American Medical Association (AMA) and many specialty societies, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). This formalization involves the designation of specific relationships between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations to avoid ambiguity. In the paradigm for prognostication used in this guideline, evidence is classified into 1 of 3 tiers based upon the degree at which the study fulfills 5 technical criteria as outlined in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field.</p>
<p> A basis for these guidelines can be viewed in Haines SJ and Nicholas JS (2006). Evidence-Based Medicine: A Conceptual Framework. In Haines SJ and Walters BC (Eds.), <em>Evidence-Based Neurosurgery: An Introduction</em> (Pages 1-17). New York: Thieme Medical Publishers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>Multidisciplinary writing groups were created for each section based on author expertise to address each of the disciplines and particular areas of therapy selected for these clinical guidelines. Each group was involved with literature selection, creation and editing of the evidence tables, and scientific foundations for their specific section and discipline. Using this information, the writing groups then drafted the recommendations in answer to the questions formulated at the beginning of the process, culminating in the clinical practice guideline for their respective discipline. The draft guidelines were then circulated to the entire clinical guideline panel to allow for multidisciplinary feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The Vestibular Schwannoma Guidelines Task Force members were required to report all possible conflicts of interest (COIs) prior to beginning work on the guideline, using the COI disclosure form of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Guidelines Committee, including potential COIs that are unrelated to the topic of the guideline. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair reviewed the disclosures and either approved or disapproved the nomination. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair are given latitude to approve nominations of Task Force members with possible conflicts and address this by restricting the writing and reviewing privileges of that person to topics unrelated to the possible COIs. The conflict of interest findings are provided in detail in the full-text introduction and methods manuscript (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>
