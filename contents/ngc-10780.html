Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based</strong>, <strong>Formal consensus</strong>, <strong>Informal consensus</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Under what circumstances (i.e., for which patients) should metastases be biopsied or otherwise sampled to test for changes from the primary tumor with respect to endocrine receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1</em>. At initial presentation of metastasis from breast cancer, it is standard of care to biopsy an accessible lesion to confirm metastatic breast cancer. When evaluating the metastatic site(s), it is important to note that the results of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and/or HER2 status may have changed from the primary tumor, and these results may inform treatment decisions. Therefore, this Panel recommends retesting for ER, PR, and HER2 on &ge; one metastasis with careful attention to assay performance, particularly for bone metastases (see the section "Clinical Interpretation" in the original guideline document). However, for patients with documented changes in these biomarkers, data are lacking to determine whether outcomes from systemic therapy are altered when guided by biomarker test results from the metastases. The Panel informal consensus for the management of care when there is discordance of ER, PR, or HER2 results between primary and metastatic tissues is to use the ER, PR, or HER2 status from the metastasis to direct therapy, if supported by the clinical scenario and the patient's goals for care. (Type: evidence based for biomarker change from primary to metastasis, but no evidence to demonstrate that systemic therapy choices affect health outcomes when biomarker change occurs; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>For women with metastatic breast cancer and with known endocrine receptor and HER2 status, which additional tumor markers have demonstrated clinical utility to initiate systemic therapy or direct selection of a new systemic therapy regimen?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2</em>. Decisions concerning the initiation of systemic therapy or selection of systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer should be guided by ER, PR, and HER2 status, in conjunction with clinical evaluation, judgment, and the patient's goals for care. Presently, there is no evidence that therapy decisions based solely on additional biomarker results improve health outcomes; thus, decisions about initiating or selecting therapy for metastatic breast cancer should be based solely on ER, PR, and HER2 status and the specific clinical scenario. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>For women with metastatic breast cancer and with known ER, PR, and HER2 status, which additional tumor markers have demonstrated clinical utility to guide decisions on switching to a different drug or regimen or discontinuing treatment?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for Tissue Biomarkers</span></p>
<p>In patients who are already receiving systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer, decisions on changing to a new drug or regimen or discontinuing treatment should be based on the patient's goals for care and clinical evaluation and judgment of disease progression or response, given that there is no evidence at this time that changing therapy solely on the basis of biomarker results beyond ER, PR, and HER2 improves health outcome, quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for Circulating Tumor Markers</span></p>
<p>In patients already receiving systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer, decisions on changing to a new drug or regimen or discontinuing treatment should be based on the patient's goals for care and clinical evaluation and judgment of disease progression or response, given that there is no evidence at this time that changing therapy solely on the basis of circulating biomarker results improves health outcome, quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.)</p>
<p>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, and CA 27-29 may be used as adjunctive assessments to contribute to decisions regarding therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Data are insufficient to recommend use of CEA, CA 15-3, and CA 27-29 alone for monitoring response to treatment. The Panel acknowledges the lack of evidence of clinical utility in support of use of these circulating biomarkers; biochemical assessments of CEA, CA 15-3, and CA 27-29 were developed before the present standards for measuring clinical utility. The recommendation for use is based on clinical experience and Panel informal consensus in the absence of studies designed to evaluate the clinical utility of the markers. As such, it is also reasonable for clinicians to not use these markers as adjunctive assessments. (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>For biomarkers shown to have clinical utility to guide decisions on systemic therapy for metastatic disease in questions 2 and 3, what are the appropriate assays, timing, and frequency of measurement?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4</em>. Decisions for systemic therapy should be influenced by ER, PR, and HER2. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recently updated the guideline addressing optimization of HER2 assays. To date, clinical utility has not been demonstrated for any additional biomarkers. (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong.)</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel developed its recommendations based on evidence identified through online searches of Medline and the Cochrane Library (from January 2006 through August 2014, to overlap with the search end date for the 2007 guideline update on tumor markers in breast cancer [Harris et al., 2007]), and their own clinical experience. See Data Supplement 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for full details on the search string. A combined PubMed search was conducted for this guideline and for a similar guideline on use of biomarkers to guide decisions on systemic therapy in metastatic breast cancer, with articles selected for each guideline's systematic review based on the patient population studied. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>Population: Women with metastatic breast cancer being considered for initiation of systemic therapy, or for changes in the drug or regimen they are receiving, with separate sub-questions and analyses on patient groups with:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Endocrine receptor positive disease </li>
    <li>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), positive disease </li>
    <li>Triple negative disease </li>
    <li>And on use of tumor marker assay results to guide decisions on: </li>
    <li>First-line therapy </li>
    <li>Second- or subsequent-line therapy </li>
</ul>
<p>Publications in English were included if they reported rigorously conducted systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective biomarker analyses of samples from completed prospective RCTs, or prospective observational studies that directly compared outcomes of treatment decisions made on the basis of assay results with outcomes of treatment decisions made regardless of assay results.</p>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative reviews; (3) published in a non-English language; (4) retrospective observational studies.</p></div>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) and the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, and community oncology, statistician, health outcome researchers, the Practice Guidelines Implementation Network, and patient/advocacy representation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. The Panel had one face-to-face meeting and three webinars. The Co-Chairs and ASCO staff prepared a draft guideline for review and rating by the Expert Panel. The Expert Panel members are listed in Appendix Table A1 of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel met on several occasions and corresponded frequently through email; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs and ASCO staff. The purpose of the Panel meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document, which was then disseminated for external review and submitted to the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology </em>(<em>JCO</em>) for peer review and publication.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the principles of the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality, to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>

Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A biomarker-based test is judged to have clinical utility if use of the test is demonstrated to result in a favorable balance of benefits to harms. If clinical care options result in similar patient survival, biomarker tests may still have clinical utility if they direct care to options that result in improved quality of life (e.g., less toxicity or inconvenience) or lower cost. A new biomarker test must be shown to contribute clinically useful information beyond that already provided by standardly used clinical or pathologic indicators, unless the new test can provide equivalent information at a lower cost, less invasively, or with less inconvenience or risk.</p></div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For needle biopsies of metastatic breast cancer to bone, submitting the accompanying blood clot in the specimen container separately from the fragments of bony tissue may yield viable tumor that would not have to undergo decalcification and could be used for the analysis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancer metastatic to skeletal tissue. If it is not possible to test a sample that has not undergone decalcification, a negative result should be interpreted with caution, and consideration should be given to an additional and more suitable biopsy sample for testing. </li>
    <li>Caution should be used when interpreting increasing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, or CA 27-29 level during the first 4 to 6 weeks of administration of a new therapy, given that spurious early increases may occur. </li>
    <li>There have been reports of liver and renal dysfunction affecting the values of serum tumor markers, which demonstrates that multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) may confuse the interpretation of serum tumor markers. There is insufficient evidence to calibrate how MCCs may affect the results of biomarker testing. </li>

    <li>The clinical practice guideline and other guidance published herein are provided by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to assist providers in clinical decision making. The information herein should not be relied on as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified herein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Furthermore, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, because the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary.

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and usually published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology </em>(<em>JCO</em>) and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
