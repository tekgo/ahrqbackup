<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 25 who have improved outcomes from the treatment.</p>
<p>Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial disease with complex psychological, environmental (social and cultural), genetic, physiologic, metabolic and behavioral causes and consequences. The prevalence of overweight and obese people is increasing worldwide at an alarming rate in both developing and developed countries. Environmental and behavioral changes brought about by economic development, modernization and urbanization have been linked to the rise in global obesity. The health consequences are becoming apparent.</p>
<p>Obesity is a national epidemic in the United States with 78 million obese adults. In 2009 to 2010, the prevalence of obesity was 35.5% among men and 35.8% among women. The prevalence of extreme obesity has also increased. Approximately 6% of U.S. adults now have a BMI of 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher. One in every three children (31.7%) is overweight or obese. More than one quarter of all Americans ages 17 to 24 are unqualified for military service because they are too heavy. Specifically, 16.9% of children were considered obese in 2009 to 2010. This data is concerning, for the Healthy People 2010 goals for obesity prevalence in the United States were not met.</p>
<p>A 5% to 10% weight loss can reduce a patient's risk of heart disease and diabetes that is clinically significant, and should be encouraged for all patients who are overweight and obese. This amount of weight loss and maintenance should be considered a clinical success and commended. This can be achieved and maintained with a high-intensity medical weight loss program even for the morbidly obese.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical costs associated with obesity were estimated at as much as $147 billion to $210 billion a year. Obese persons had estimated medical costs that were $1,429 higher per person, per year than persons of normal weight. </li>
    <li>Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States (U.S.), with only tobacco use causing more deaths. More than 112,000 preventable deaths per year are associated with obesity. </li>
    <li>Obesity and major depression frequently co-occur. A meta-analysis study showed obesity was found to be an increased risk of depression, and depression was found to be a predictor of developing obesity. </li>
    <li>Several of the comorbidities associated with obesity include type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia and certain cancers. The prevalence of various medical conditions increases with those who are overweight and obese. </li>
