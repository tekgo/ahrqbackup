Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version provides information on parents'/caretakers' experience with their child's health plan for the population of children with chronic conditions (CCC). </p>
<p>Results include the same ratings, composites and individual question summary rates as those reported for the <a href="/browse/by-organization-indiv.aspx?orgid=8&amp;objid=49785" title="CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version Measures" target="_blank">CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version</a>. In addition, three CCC composites summarize satisfaction with basic components of care essential for successful treatment, management and support of children with chronic conditions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Access to Specialized Services </li>
    <li>Family Centered Care: Personal Doctor Who Knows Child </li>
    <li>Coordination of Care for Children with Chronic Conditions </li>
</ol>
<p>Item-specific question summary rates are reported for each composite question. Question summary rates are also reported individually for two items summarizing the following concepts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Access to Prescription Medicines </li>
    <li>Family Centered Care: Getting Needed Information </li>
</ol>
<p>For this "Access to Specialized Services" measure, parents/caretakers of children with chronic conditions report how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," or "Always") it was easy to get special medical equipment or devices, therapy, and treatment or counseling for their child in the last 6 months. The "Access to Specialized Services" composite measure is based on three questions in the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H, Child Version.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA's) Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM) has long felt that consumer experience with health care is a critical component of quality of care, that experience affects care outcome&mdash;and that experience is itself a measure of outcome. Survey results give health plans the opportunity for continuous improvement in member care.</p></div>
