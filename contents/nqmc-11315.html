Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure assesses hospital-level, 30-day risk-standardized excess days in acute care (EDAC) for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal diagnosis of heart failure (HF). Days in acute care are defined as days spent in an emergency department (ED), admitted to observation status, or admitted as an unplanned readmission for any cause to a short-term acute care hospital.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p>
<p>CMS calculates EDAC, for each hospital, as the difference ("excess") between a hospital's predicted days and expected days per 100 discharges. "Expected days" is the average number of risk-adjusted days in acute care a hospital's patients would have been expected to spend if discharged from an average performing hospital with the same case mix. "Predicted days" is the average number of days a hospital's patients spent in acute care after adjusting for the risk factors (see Table D in the original measure documentation).</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In the context of the publicly reported Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) 30-day heart failure readmission measure, the increasing use of emergency department (ED) visits and observation stays has raised concerns that the current CMS 30-day heart failure readmission measure does not capture the full range of unplanned acute care in the post-discharge period. In particular, there exists concern that high use of observation stays could in some cases replace readmissions, and hospitals with high rates of observation stays in the post-discharge period may therefore have low readmission rates that do not accurately reflect the quality of care (Carlson, 2013). In response to these concerns, CMS has built a measure for heart failure that incorporates the full range of post-discharge use of acute care.</p>
<p>The goal of this measure is to improve patient care by providing patients, physicians, and hospitals with information about hospital-level, risk-standardized acute care use following hospitalization for heart failure. Measurement of patient outcomes allows for a broad view of quality of care that cannot be captured entirely by individual process-of-care measures. Safely transitioning patients from hospital to home requires a complex series of tasks which would be cumbersome to capture individually as process measures: timely and effective communication between providers, prevention of and response to complications, patient education about post-discharge care and self-management, timely follow-up, and more. Suboptimal transitions contribute to a variety of adverse outcomes post-discharge, including ED evaluation, need for observation, and readmission. Measures of unplanned readmission already exist, but there are no current measures for ED and observation stay utilization. It is thus difficult for providers and consumers to gain a complete picture of post-discharge outcomes. Moreover, separately reporting each outcome encourages "gaming," such as recategorizing readmission stays as observation stays to avoid a readmission outcome. By capturing a range of outcomes that are important to patients, CMS can produce a more complete picture of post-discharge outcomes that better informs consumers about care quality and incentivizes global improvement in transitional care.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Heart failure was the second most common principal discharge diagnosis among patients with Medicare in 2012 (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, n.d.) Heart failure also accounts for a large fraction of hospitalization costs and it was the third most expensive condition billed to Medicare in 2011 (Torio &amp; Andrews, 2013). </li>
    <li>Patients admitted for heart failure have disproportionately high readmission rates. Readmission rates following discharge for heart failure are highly variable across hospitals in the United States (U.S.) (Krumholz et al., 2009; Bernheim et al., 2010). For the time period between July 2012 and June 2013, hospitals' 30-day risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) for heart failure ranged from 17.0% to 28.2% (Yale New Haven Health Services Corporation [YNHHSC] &amp; Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation [CORE], 2014). </li>
    <li>Patients, however, are not only at risk of requiring rehospitalization in the post-discharge period. Emergency department (ED) visits represent a significant proportion of post-discharge acute care utilization. Two recent studies conducted in patients of all ages have shown that 9.5% of patients return to the ED within 30 days of hospital discharge and that about 12.0% of these patients are discharged from the ED and are not captured by the current Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) 30-day heart failure readmission measure (Rising et al., 2013; Vashi et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>Additionally, over the past decade, the use of observation stays has rapidly increased. Between 2001 and 2008, the use of observation services increased nearly three-fold (Venkatesh et al., 2011), and significant variation has been demonstrated in the use of observation services for conditions such as chest pain (Schuur et al., 2011). These rising rates of observation stays among Medicare beneficiaries have gained the attention of patients, providers, and policymakers (Feng, Wright, &amp; Mor, 2012; Rising et al., 2013; Vashi et al., 2013). A report from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) noted that in 2012, Medicare beneficiaries had 1.5 million observation stays. Many of these observation stays lasted longer than the intended one day. The OIG report also noted the potential relationship between hospital use of observation stays as an alternative to short-stay inpatient hospitalizations as a response to changing hospital payment incentives (Wright, 2013). </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models</strong></p>
<p>The heart failure (HF) excess days of acute care (EDAC) measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause EDAC using a hierarchical generalized linear model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology reports for further details. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the model using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies in each year. </p>
<p>CMS assessed the overall fit of the model using posterior predictive checking (PPC) for the three-year combined period. For the logit model of zero versus non-zero days, which includes all patients in the cohort, they calculated the c-statistic. For the truncated Poisson model of non-zero days, which includes only patients with some acute care, they calculated the deviance R<sup>2</sup>. The deviance R<sup>2</sup> is computed from the difference in the log-likelihoods between the final model and an empty model (no covariates) attributed to each observation, averaged over all observations (Cameron &amp; Windmeijer, 1996). </p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.3 of the original measure documentation. </p>
<p><strong>HF EDAC 2017 Model Results </strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of HF Model Variables </em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were quite stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Increases in asthma (10.1% to 13.3%), cardio-respiratory failure and shock (29.9% to 33.7%), other psychiatric disorders (21.1% to 23.6%), and renal failure (62.8% to 65.0%) </li>
    <li>A decrease in other urinary tract disorders (30.9% to 28.5%) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>HF Model Parameters and Performance </em></p>
<p>Table 4.3.2 in the original measure documentation shows the parameter estimates and 95% credible intervals (CIs) for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.3.3 in the original measure documentation shows the PPC results for the combined three-year dataset. The c-statistic for the logit part was 0.60. The deviance R<sup>2</sup> for the truncated Poisson part was 0.029. </p>

All-cause days in acute care within 30 days from the date of discharge from an index heart failure (HF) admission</p>
<p>Days in acute care are defined as days spent in an emergency department (ED), admitted to observation status, or admitted as an unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days from the date of discharge from the index admission. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Each ED visit is counted as one half-day (0.5 days). </li>
    <li>Observation stays are recorded in terms of hours and converted for the measure into half-days (rounded up). </li>
    <li>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) defines a readmission as any unplanned acute care hospital inpatient hospitalization within 30 days of the discharge date for the index hospitalization. "Planned" readmissions are those planned by providers for anticipated medical treatment or procedures that must be provided in the inpatient setting. To exclude planned readmissions, use the planned readmission algorithm previously developed for the publicly reported CMS 30-day HF readmission measure (see Appendix E in the original measure documentation). Each rehospitalization is counted according to the length of stay, which is calculated as the discharge date minus the admission date. Admissions that extend beyond the 30-day follow-up period are truncated on day 30. </li>
    <li>When an ED visit, observation stay, or readmission overlaps with another event on the same day, only the most severe of the overlapping events is counted. </li>

<p>Because some patients do not survive 30 days, not all patients are at risk for an acute event for the same amount of time. "Exposure time" is calculated as the number of days each patient survived after discharge, up to 30. This exposure time was incorporated as part of the outcome to reflect differential risk for EDAC after discharge. This differs from the existing CMS HF 30-day readmission measures, which consider all patients to be equally at risk for a hospital event regardless of survival time.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome. </p>
<p class="Note">See the <em><a href="https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;cid=1228775310395" title="QualityNet Web site">2017 Condition-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Excess Days in Acute Care Measures</a></em> for more details. </p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Admissions identified as planned by the planned readmissions algorithm are not counted. The planned readmission algorithm is a set of criteria for classifying readmissions and planned among the general Medicare population using Medicare administrative claims data. The algorithm identifies admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. </p>
<p>The planned readmission algorithm has three fundamental principles: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, rehabilitation); </li>
    <li>Otherwise, a planned readmission is defined as a non-acute readmission for a scheduled procedure; and </li>
    <li>Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned.
    <p>The planned readmission algorithm uses a flow chart and four tables of specific procedure categories and discharge diagnosis categories to classify readmissions as planned. The flow chart and tables are available in the original measure documentation. </p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables </strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission. </p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment. </p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of healthcare that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum's (NQF's) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed days in acute care is higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the for the logit part of the models and the deviance R<sup>2</sup> values for the Poisson part of the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables. </p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission.</p></div>
