Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patient-months of pediatric (less than 18 years) in-center hemodialysis patients (irrespective of frequency of dialysis) with documented monthly normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) measurements.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) provides an estimate of dietary protein intake and has been shown to provide additional information to spKt/V. Studies have shown that in adolescent patients who achieved target spKt/V levels, nPCR was associated with nutritional status. Furthermore, there is evidence that nPCR less than 1 gram/kg/day is predictive of malnutrition and sustained weight loss among adolescent patients.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb data were used to calculate the inter-unit reliability (IUR) for the overall 12 months to assess the reliability of this measure. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based IUR was estimated using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. The developer notes that the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. Since this measure is not normally distributed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The overall IUR was 0.985, which indicates that about 98.5% of the variation in the measure can be attributed to the between facility differences and 1.5% to within facility variation.</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The IUR suggests this measure is reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Concurrent validity was used as a method for testing the association between facility percentage of patients with normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) data elements and mean serum albumin. Although serum albumin is not a gold standard for nutritional assessment, it is a strong indicator of patient health and mortality in dialysis patients.</p>
<p>Using calendar year 2013 CROWNWeb data, average facility-mean albumin was compared between the two groups using a two-sided two-sample t-test, using facility percent of patients with nPCR data elements and mean serum albumin. Facilities were then categorized into one of two groups:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Facilities with 100% reporting of nPCR among their pediatric patients; </li>
    <li>Facilities with less than 100% reporting of nPCR among their pediatric patients </li>
</ol>
<p>nPCR values outside the range of [0.2, 1.8] were excluded.</p>
<p>This measure was also reviewed and approved by a clinical technical expert panel (TEP) in 2010.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Among facilities with at least 11 eligible pediatric patients with recorded nPCR values, facilities with 100% reporting of recorded nPCR values had a mean serum albumin of 3.77, while facilities with less than 100% reporting of recorded nPCR values had a mean serum albumin of 4.0. Using a t-test, these values were statistically significant (p-value 0.02).</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>These findings are somewhat unexpected, and in the opposite direction of analyses previously conducted. This difference may have resulted from a larger sample utilized for the current analyses (previous analyses were conducted over a limited timeframe). The developer speculates that the observed findings may have resulted if facilities are more likely to collect necessary data elements for nPCR assessment in patients for which nutritional concerns exist. These results therefore do not necessarily contradict the importance of evaluating nPCR.</p></div>

Number of all patient-months for pediatric (less than 18 years old) in-center hemodialysis patients (irrespective of frequency of dialysis)</p>
<p>The duration of hemodialysis treatment will be calculated as the difference between the first "Kt/V Collection Date" and "Date Regular Chronic Dialysis Began." The patient's age will be determined by subtracting the patient's date of birth from the first day of the reporting month. In-center hemodialysis patients are defined as follows: "Admit Date" to the specified facility is prior or equal to the first day of the study period, AND the patient has not been discharged ("Discharge Date" is null or blank), OR "Discharge Date" from the facility is greater than or equal to the last day of the study period AND "Treatment Dialysis Broad Start Date" is prior or equal to the first day of the study period, AND "Dialysis Broad Type of Treatment" = 'HD,' AND "Primary Dialysis Setting" = 'Dialysis Facility/Center' on the last day of the study period, AND "Date Regular Chronic Dialysis Began" is prior to the first day of the study period.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Exclusions that are implicit in the denominator definition include adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 years old), all patients who have not been in the facility for the entire reporting month, and all home hemodialysis patients. There are no additional exclusions for this measure.</p></div>
