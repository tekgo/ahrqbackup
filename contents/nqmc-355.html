<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Nutritional interventions are commonly advised for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A major goal of these interventions is to retard the progression of kidney disease and therefore delay the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). To achieve this goal, the standard recommendation has been to restrict the intake of dietary protein, especially animal protein. This recommendation is based on animal studies that have shown that higher dietary intakes of protein can accelerate the progression of CKD, and in turn, restriction of dietary protein intake has been shown to slow progression of CKD. Another major goal of low-protein diets (LPDs) is to reduce the symptoms of uremia, metabolic acidosis and hyperphosphatemia that occur as CKD inevitably progresses.</p>

<p>Results from higher quality studies in humans with CKD are inconclusive regarding the beneficial effects of these diets on the progression of kidney disease; they also suggest that patients on lower protein diets may be at risk for malnutrition. For these reasons, the use of low-protein diets in CKD patients remains controversial.</p>

<p>Nutritional interventions have several other important goals. Regardless of prescribed diet, CKD  patients are at risk for malnutrition, generally because of inadequate energy and protein intake resulting from decreased appetite. Therefore, many nutritional interventions recommend an increase in energy intake. Another goal is prevention of hyperphosphatemia; therefore it is often recommended that CKD patients restrict intake of organic and inorganic phosphates. Other nutritional interventions focus on the prevention of bone disease, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and hyperlipidemia.</p>

<p>Two large, one medium-sized, and one small observational studies provide evidence to suggest that malnutrition in this population may be a function of decreased protein and energy intake. Most diet intervention studies in this population have emphasized energy intakes greater than 30 kcal/kg body weight/day. In addition, most studies evaluating a LPD did not limit protein intake much lower than 0.6 g/kg body weight/day. It was the opinion of the&nbsp;measure developer&nbsp;that patients with signs of malnutrition should have protein intakes at least this high.</p>
