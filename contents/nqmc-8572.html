Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) who received calcium and vitamin D level testing within 3 months of diagnosis. </p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The pathogenesis of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is poorly understood. Symptoms usually present within 3 years after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and are often preceded by a history of acute GVHD. Manifestations of chronic GVHD may be restricted to a single organ or tissue or may be widespread. Chronic GVHD can lead to debilitating consequences, e.g., joint contractures, loss of sight, end-stage lung disease, or mortality resulting from profound chronic immune suppression leading to recurrent or life-threatening infections. </p>
<p><em>Support (verbatim) from National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Project</em>: Musculoskeletal complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are caused by chronic GVHD and its treatment with corticosteroids. The most frequent problems include fasciitis, sclerotic contractures and limitation in the range of motion, steroid-induced myopathy, and osteoporosis. </p>
<p>In patients with chronic GVHD, a baseline calcium (total and ionized) and vitamin D levels should be tested. These tests should be repeated at least annually when normal or as clinically indicated when abnormal or predicted to become abnormal.</p>
<p><em>Statements (verbatim) on gap</em>: Bone mineral density declines measurably by 12 months post transplant in both males and females receiving allogeneic HCT, particularly if treated for chronic GVHD. Investigators report nontraumatic fractures in 11% of patients and avascular necrosis in 10% by 3 years post-transplant. In a different sample of survivors 10 years post transplant, osteoporosis rate was 18% and restricted to women. </p>
<p>Vitamin D (VD) deficiency can cause osteomalacia, bone pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, and increased risk of fracture, and may precipitate or exacerbate osteopenia and osteoporosis. Patients receiving treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may have limited exposure to sunlight and often experience gastrointestinal side effects that may decrease their ability to maintain an adequate VD level. We hypothesized that patients with AML and ALL would have a low VD level after allogeneic HCT, and that these patients would have a high incidence of osteoporosis/osteopenia. We therefore studied the incidence of low VD level and low bone mineral density after HCT. Of 289 patients with AML or ALL undergoing HCT between January 1, 2000, and January 31, 2009, at the Cleveland Clinic, 58 (20.1%) patients had VD testing after HCT. Of these, 52 (89.7%) patients had a low VD level, and 6 (10.3%) had a normal level. Most patients with VD testing had GVHD and were taking corticosteroids (94.8% and 98.3%, respectively). Of the 49 patients with VD testing who also had bone mineral density testing, 65% had abnormal (low bone density) results. Only 21% of patients with VD testing were taking VD supplements prior to testing, and 65% had an elevated parathyroid hormone level. We found that most patients did not have VD testing after HCT, but those that did were very likely to have a low level and have low bone mineral density. Those with a low VD level were likely to have received corticosteroids, have GVHD, and have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Given the potential morbidity of low VD level, VD deficiency should be considered after HCT. Prospective study of VD level and its impact on morbidity and mortality after HCT is warranted. </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Reported incidence rates of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after allogeneic transplantation range from 6% to 80% according to recipient age, donor type, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) source (peripheral blood, bone marrow, or umbilical cord blood stem cells), graft manipulation (T-cell depletion), and use of post transplantation donor lymphocyte infusion (DLIs). Reliable incidence estimates in different cohorts of HCT recipients are compromised by (1) lack of standardized, widely used diagnostic guidelines; (2) variability in observer experience; (3) limited expert follow-up at a distance from transplant centers; (4) differences in the statistical methods applied (e.g., use of the Kaplan-Meier versus cumulative incidence estimates and variable requirement for some minimal survival [60-100 days] for patients to be considered at risk of chronic GVHD); and (5) the sometimes protean nature of early chronic GVHD symptoms, which mimic alternative diagnoses.</p></div>
