Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the quality of evidence assessment (<strong>I-III</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>A-E, L</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Pressure (BP) Measurement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>BP should be measured with the woman in the sitting position with the arm at the level of the heart. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>An appropriately sized cuff (i.e., length 1.5 times the circumference of the arm) should be used. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Korotkoff phase V should be used to designate diastolic BP. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>If BP is consistently higher in one arm, the arm with the higher values should be used for all BP measurements. (<strong>III-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>BP can be measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer, a calibrated aneroid device, or an automated BP machine that has been validated for use in preeclampsia. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Automated BP machines that have not been validated for use in women with preeclampsia may underestimate or overestimate BP in those women; a comparison of readings using mercury sphygmomanometry or a calibrated aneroid device is recommended. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>In the office setting, when BP elevation is non-severe and preeclampsia is not suspected, ambulatory BP monitoring or home BP monitoring is useful to confirm persistently elevated BP. (<strong>II-2C</strong>) </li>
    <li>When home BP monitoring is used, maternity care providers should ensure that patients have adequate training in measuring their BP and interpreting the readings. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The accuracy of all BP measurement devices used in hospitals or offices should be checked regularly against a calibrated device. (<strong>II-3C</strong>) </li>
    <li>The accuracy of all automated devices used for home BP monitoring should be checked regularly against a calibrated device. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Hypertension</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="11">
    <li>The diagnosis of hypertension should be based on office or in-hospital BP measurements. (<strong>II-B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Hypertension in pregnancy should be defined as an office (or in-hospital) systolic BP &ge;140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &ge;90 mmHg, based on the average of <em>at least</em> 2 measurements, taken at least 15 minutes apart, using the same arm. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Resistant hypertension should be defined as the need for 3 antihypertensive medications for BP control at &ge;20 weeks' gestation. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>A transient hypertensive effect should be defined as an office systolic BP &ge;140 mmHg or a diastolic BP &ge;90 mmHg that is not confirmed after rest, on repeat measurement, on the same or on subsequent visits. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>A white-coat hypertensive effect refers to BP that is elevated in the office (i.e., systolic &ge;140 mmHg or diastolic &ge;90 mmHg), but &lt;135 mmHg (systolic) and &lt;85 mmHg (diastolic) on ambulatory or home BP monitoring. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>A masked hypertensive effect refers to blood pressure that is normal in the office (i.e., systolic &lt;140 mmHg and diastolic &lt;90 mmHg) but elevated on ambulatory or home BP monitoring (i.e., systolic &ge;135 mmHg or diastolic &ge;85 mmHg). (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Severe hypertension should be defined, in any setting, as a systolic BP of &ge;160 mmHg or a diastolic BP of &ge;110 mmHg based on the average of <em>at least</em> 2 measurements, taken at least 15 minutes apart, using the same arm. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Measurement of Proteinuria</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="18">
    <li>All pregnant women should be assessed for proteinuria. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Urinary dipstick testing (by visual or automated testing) may be used for screening for proteinuria when the suspicion of preeclampsia is low. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Significant proteinuria should be defined as &ge;0.3 g/d in a complete 24-hour urine collection or &ge;30 mg/mmol urinary creatinine in a spot (random) urine sample. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Significant proteinuria should be suspected when urinary dipstick proteinuria is &ge;1+. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>More definitive testing for proteinuria (by urinary protein:creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine collection) is encouraged when there is a suspicion of preeclampsia, including: &ge;1+ dipstick proteinuria in women with hypertension and rising blood pressure and in women with normal blood pressure, but symptoms or signs suggestive of preeclampsia. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Proteinuria testing does not need to be repeated once significant proteinuria of preeclampsia has been confirmed. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient information to make a recommendation about the accuracy of the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio. (<strong>II-2L</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Classification of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDPs)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="25">
    <li>HDPs should be classified as pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or "other hypertensive effects" on the basis of different diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) See Table 2 in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>The presence or absence of preeclampsia must be ascertained, given its clear association with more adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>In women with pre-existing hypertension, preeclampsia should be defined as resistant hypertension, new <em>or</em> worsening proteinuria, one or more adverse conditions, or one or more severe complications. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>In women with gestational hypertension, preeclampsia should be defined as new-onset proteinuria, one or more adverse conditions, or one or more severe complications. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Severe preeclampsia should be defined as preeclampsia complicated by one or more severe complications. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Severe preeclampsia, as defined in this guideline, warrants delivery. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>The term PIH (pregnancy-induced hypertension) should be abandoned, as its meaning in clinical practice is unclear. (<strong>III-D</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Investigations to Classify HDPs</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="32">
    <li>For women with pre-existing hypertension, the following should be performed in early pregnancy (if not previously documented): serum creatinine, fasting blood glucose, serum potassium, and urinalysis (<strong>III-D</strong>), and electrocardiogram (EKG). (<strong>II-2C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Among women with pre-existing hypertension or those with a strong clinical risk marker for preeclampsia, additional baseline laboratory testing may be based on other considerations deemed important by health care providers. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women with suspected preeclampsia should undergo the maternal laboratory (<strong>II-2B</strong>) and pertinent fetal (<strong>II-1B</strong>) testing. See Table 4 in the original guideline document. </li>
    <li>Doppler velocimetry-based assessment of the fetal circulation may be useful to support a placental origin for hypertension, proteinuria, and/or adverse conditions including intrauterine growth restriction, (<strong>II-2B</strong>) and for the timing of delivery. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of the biophysical profile as part of a schedule of fetal testing in women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. (<strong>II-2L</strong>) </li>
    <li>If initial testing is reassuring, but there is ongoing concern about preeclampsia (e.g., change in maternal and/or fetal condition), maternal and fetal testing should be repeated. (<strong>III-C</strong>) </li>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Knowledge Translations Tools and Implementation of the Guideline</strong></p>
<p>The Appendix (see Table 10 in the full version of the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) lists tools to support the application of this guideline. Some Web sites provide general information about blood pressure (BP) measurement for non-pregnant patients, but the recommendations are similar enough to those for pregnant women to be useful. Patients, their partners, and their care providers should be well educated about the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and relevant sites are listed.</p>
<p>Implementation of any evidence depends on individual knowledge and beliefs, as well as institutional culture. Strong recommendations should be incorporated into clinical practice. In well-resourced settings, almost all preeclampsia-related maternal deaths involve substandard care.</p>
<p>Some updates to the 2008 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) guidelines on the HDP may require additional effort to implement.</p>
<p>Recommendation 9 states that all measurement devices used in hospitals or offices should be checked regularly against a calibrated device may not be possible for all Canadian hospitals and offices to do on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Physicians should consider the category "other HDP" (white-coat and masked hypertension) as part of the classification of hypertensive women and consider using some form of out-of-office BP measurement to evaluate women with non-severe pre-existing or gestational hypertension.</p>
<p>Health care providers should inform pregnant women about the symptoms and signs of the HDPs and refer them to appropriate knowledge translation tools.</p>
<p>The developer recommends the use of corticosteroids for women &le;34+6 weeks' gestation who are at high risk of delivery within the next seven days. This gestational age cut-off represents a fundamental change in practice that will require discussion.</p>
<p>Physicians should be familiar with the blood bank policies of their own hospital.</p>
<p>Physicians should be aware of postpartum signs of maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and the maternal and perinatal long-term effects of HDPs, especially at this vulnerable time in maternal care when the maternity care provider is often handing back care to the primary care physician.</p>
<p>The reader is reminded to refer to the full open-access guideline published in <em>Pregnancy Hypertension</em>, which contains not only the recommendations presented here, but also all explanatory text and additional references.</p></div>
