Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of deliveries of live births between November 6 of the year prior to the measurement year and November 5 of the measurement year that received a prenatal care visit as a member of the organization in the first trimester <em>or</em> within 42 days of enrollment in the organization.</p>
<p>This measure is a component of a composite measure; it can also be used on its own. See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measure <a href="/content.aspx?id=49780" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Postpartum care: percentage of deliveries that had a postpartum visit on or between 21 and 56 days after delivery</a>.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Administrative and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Administrative Specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid Specification. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Preventive medicine is fundamental to prenatal care. Healthy diet, counseling, vitamin supplements, identification of maternal risk factors and health promotion must occur early in pregnancy to have an optimal effect on outcome. Poor outcomes include spontaneous abortion, low-birth-weight babies, large-for-gestational-age babies and neonatal infection. Early prenatal care is also an essential part of helping a pregnant woman prepare to become a mother. Ideally, a pregnant woman will have her first prenatal visit during the first trimester of pregnancy. Some women enroll in an organization at a later stage of pregnancy; in this case, it is essential for the organization to begin providing prenatal care as quickly as possible.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although many women experience uncomplicated pregnancies, timely and adequate prenatal care can prevent poor birth outcomes (Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2012). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (2012) recommend that a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy be examined every 4 weeks for the first 28 weeks of pregnancy, every 2 to 3 weeks until 36 weeks of gestation and weekly thereafter. </li>
    <li>In 2012, the low-birth weight rate was 8 percent and the preterm birth rate was 11.5 percent (Martin et al., 2013). The cost of lost work and pay over the lifespan of babies born preterm is $5.7 billion (March of Dimes Foundation, 2013). </li>
    <li>Each year in the United States, one in eight infants is born preterm. In 2009, preterm births represented 35 percent of infant deaths (Partridge et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Nearly 30 percent of pregnant women 25 years of age and older do not receive timely prenatal care (Maternal and Child Health Bureau [MCHB], 2011). Pregnancies with limited prenatal care have twice the risk of preterm birth and infant mortality than pregnancies with sufficient care (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). </li>
    <li>Appropriate perinatal services and education are crucial components of a healthy birth. Understanding how to stay healthy is important for preventing complications that can affect the health of both mother and baby before, during and after pregnancy. </li>
</ul>
