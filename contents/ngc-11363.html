<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategy of Systematic Reviews</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Chinese Databases</strong></p>
<p>The guideline development team searched Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANFANG DATA, China Biology Medicine and VIP). They ran the search with the date restrictions of database inception through October 2015.</p>
<p><strong>English Databases</strong></p>
<p>The guideline development team searched English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science). They ran the search with the date restrictions of database inception through December 2015. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategy of Original Research</span></strong> </p>
<p>After the search of existing systematic reviews, there were still some clinical questions the guideline development group needed to answer. So, they searched the original research to develop new systematic reviews. They searched Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANFANG DATA, China Biology Medicine) and English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science). They ran the search with the date restrictions of database inception through March 2016. Refer to the Appendix (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for searches of different clinical questions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Two independent reviewers conducted title scans and advanced articles if either one thought them relevant. The abstract review phase was designed to identify studies reporting the effectiveness or safety of the intervention. Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts. Differences between investigators regarding the inclusion or exclusion of abstracts were resolved through consensus adjudication. Full articles underwent another independent parallel review regarding their appropriateness for inclusion. Refer to the Appendix (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for selection criteria for systematic reviews and original studies.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Data extraction was conducted in the development of new systematic reviews. The guideline development group used standardized forms from the previous reviews as templates for data extraction and pilot tested them for the new medications and outcomes. By creating standardized forms for data extraction, they sought to maximize consistency in identifying all pertinent data available for synthesis.</p>
<p>For all articles, the reviewers extracted information on the general study characteristics (e.g., title, study site, source of funding, study design, study period); study participants (e.g., age, gender, inclusion criteria); interventions (e.g., characteristic, frequency of use, duration of use), comparisons and the outcome results. </p>
<p>For continuous outcomes, they extracted the mean difference between groups and a measure of dispersion. For dichotomous outcomes, they extracted the number of events and the number of participants in each group. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Evaluation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Quality Evaluation of Existing Systematic Reviews </strong></p>
<p>Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of existing systematic reviews. They assessed the quality of existing systematic reviews using the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (R-AMSTAR). It could produce quantifiable assessments of systematic review quality. </p>
<p><strong>Risk of Bias Assessment of Individual Studies </strong></p>
<p>They evaluated the risk of bias in individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis</span></strong> </p>
<p>Data synthesis was conducted in the development of new systematic reviews. The guideline development group conducted meta-analyses when there were sufficient data (at least 2 trials) and studies were sufficiently homogeneous. They tested the heterogeneity among the trials considered for quantitative pooling using a chi-squared test with a significance level of alpha less than or equal to 0.05, and also examined heterogeneity among studies with an <em>I</em>&sup2; statistic. They pooled the mean difference/risk ratio between groups using a random-effects model with the low heterogeneity (<em>I</em>&sup2;&lt;50%) or fixed-effects model with no heterogeneity.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of the Body of Evidence</span></strong> </p>
<p>The newly developed systematic reviews and existing systematic reviews of high quality (Score of R-AMSTAR &ge;70) were used as the evidence for key clinical questions. After the completion of the newly developed systematic reviews, the guideline development group assessed the strength of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach. </p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Going from Evidence to Recommendation</span></strong></p>
<p>According to the GRADE approach, the guideline development group adopted the GRADE grid and used a modified Delphi technique to develop the grade of recommendation. In this process, they considered the patient value and preference, economic factors, benefits and harms and quality of evidence together.</p>
<p><strong>Patient Value and Preference</strong></p>
<p>The guideline development group conducted a survey to acquire the information about patient values and preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Factors </strong></p>
<p>The guideline development group considered the economic factors from the cost of non-pharmaceutical therapies and cost of Chinese patent medicine. </p>
<p><strong>Consensus Rules</strong> </p>
<p>Here are some rules about the consensus:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Except "0", the vote of any choices is more than 50%, which is deemed to reach a consensus. The guideline development group can make a decision about the direction and strength of the recommendation. </li>
    <li>The vote of any two choices (happened simultaneously at the right of "0" or the left of "0") is more than 70%, which is deemed to reach a consensus. The guideline development group can make a decision about the direction of the recommendation, and the strength of the recommendation is "weak". </li>
    <li>And, the other situations are not deemed to reach a consensus. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Result - Going from Evidence to Recommendation</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Patient Values and Preferences</strong></p>
<p>A total of 217 subjects took part in their investigation of patient values and preferences. There were 72 men and 145 women, aged from 18 to 72 years. The results are as follows: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>When patients chose the treatment for primary headache disorders, first, they would consider the cure, reducing recurrence, low incidence of adverse reactions, and then, the convenience of treatment and rapid pain relief and, last, the treatment cost and health insurance. </li>
    <li>When patients chose the treatment for primary headache disorders, they would choose non-pharmaceutical therapy, and then the pharmaceutical therapy. </li>
    <li>When patients chose non-pharmaceutical therapy, they would choose acupuncture and tuina, and then other non-pharmaceutical therapies. </li>
    <li>When patients chose pharmaceutical therapy, they would choose Chinese patent medicine, and then Western medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation Consensus </strong></p>
<p>A total of 21 experts (see Table 1 in the Appendix [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) took part in the consensus conference. On the basis of quality of evidence, benefits and harms, patient value and preference and economic factors, the guideline development group conducted a 3 rounds consensus and developed 15 recommendations. Consensus results of each round are presented in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 in the Appendix.</p></div>
