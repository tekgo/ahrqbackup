Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of the recommendation (strongly recommended, recommended, or no recommendation) and the quality of the evidence (1a‒5b) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>It is strongly recommended that physical therapists provide exercise therapy, including endurance and strength training, throughout the hemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) process to reduce/minimize the effects of immobility and consequences of the HSCT treatment, which contributes to improved quality of life (QoL) (Wolin et al., 2010 [1a]; Wiskemann &amp; Huber, 2008 [1b]; Baumann et al., 2011 [2b]; Hacker et al., 2011 [2b]; Baumann et al., 2010 [2b]; Hayes et al., 2004).
    <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: Side effects of immunosuppressive therapy and bed rest can include loss of muscle mass, strength and endurance (Wolin et al., 2010 [1a]; Knols et al., 2005 [1a]; Wiskemann &amp; Huber, 2008 [1b]; Baumann et al., 2011 [2b]).</p>
    <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Pediatric patients benefitted from frequent, supervised intervention, suggesting the need for higher frequency to achieve desired outcomes (Wolin et al., 2010 [1a]).</p>
    <p><strong>Note 3</strong>: Full recovery from HSCT is a 3 to 5 year process. Recovery may be accelerated by exercise interventions to increase work related capabilities, improve social support and manage depression (Syrjala et al., 2004 [4a]).</p>
    </li>
    <li>It is recommended that a physical therapist provide the following interventions in the pre-transplant phase:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Complete a physical therapy examination to establish a baseline level of function and QoL (Local Consensus, 2013 [5]). </li>
        <li>Make recommendations for treatment (based upon) specific to the evaluation results, as appropriate (Wiskemann et al., 2011 [2b]; Local Consensus, 2013 [5]). </li>
        <li>Educate families regarding the benefits of structured exercise therapy throughout the HSCT process to reduce the effects of immobility and consequences of the HSCT treatment (Local Consensus, 2013 [5]).
        <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: It is preferred the physical therapy examination be completed, including assessments of strength, endurance and QoL, prior to the initiation of the preparative regimen and inpatient admission for HSCT in order to obtain an accurate baseline measurement and identify needs for physical therapy intervention (Wiskemann et al., 2011 [2b]; Local Consensus, 2013 [5]).</p>
        <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Caregiver and patient education should be provided using appropriate methods including, but not limited to instructional materials or 1:1 educational sessions (Local Consensus, 2013 [5]).</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>It is strongly recommended that during the HSCT inpatient stay, starting at admission or the initiation of the preparative treatment regimen and continuing until discharge, a physical therapist provide a supervised, low to moderate intensity exercise program to positively affect QoL, including:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Aerobic endurance training (Wolin et al., 2010 [1a]; Wiskemann &amp; Huber, 2008 [1b]; Knols et al., 2011 [2a]; Baumann et al., 2011 [2b]; Baumann et al., 2010 [2b]; Jarden et al., 2009 [2b]; Jarden et al., 2007 [2b]) </li>
        <li>Exercises dealing with strength, balance/coordination and flexibility (Wolin et al., 2010 [1a]; Wiskemann &amp; Huber, 2008 [1b]; Knols et al., 2011 [2a]; Baumann et al., 2011 [2b]; Baumann et al., 2010 [2b]; Jarden et al., 2009 [2b]; Jarden et al., 2007 [2b])
        <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: During the inpatient stay for HSCT, the risk of infection is high and physical activity options may be restricted, therefore equipment and exercise options may be reduced (Wolin et al., 2010 [1a]; Local Consensus, 2013 [5]).</p>
        <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: A higher frequency exercise program (i.e., 5 times per week or daily) is beneficial in stabilizing physical performance (Wolin et al., 2010 [1a]; Wiskemann &amp; Huber, 2008 [1b]; Jarden et al., 2009 [2b]).</p>
        <p><strong>Note 3</strong>: A low to moderate intensity exercise program for 30 to 60 minutes (with rest intervals as needed) may include:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Aerobic exercise at 50% to 75% of the heart rate max and a rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of 10 to 13 </li>
            <li>Strengthening/stretching exercises at an RPE of 10 to 13 </li>
            <li>Progressive relaxation exercises at an RPE of 6 to 9 (Jarden et al., 2009 [2b]; Local Consensus, 2013 [5]) </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>It is recommended that during the HSCT inpatient stay, a physical therapist provide interventions to promote functional mobility, including transfers, walking and stair climbing (Baumann et al., 2011 [2b]; Local Consensus, 2013 [5]) and relaxation through progressive relaxation exercises (Jarden et al., 2009 [2b]; Jarden et al., 2007 [2b]). </li>
    <li>It is strongly recommended that following discharge from the HSCT inpatient stay, a physical therapist provide a supervised, scheduled moderate intensity exercise program (with the goal to return the individual to functional baseline level or until progress is no longer demonstrated) including the following:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Aerobic endurance training (Wolin et al., 2010 [1a]; Wiskemann &amp; Huber, 2008 [1b]; Knols et al., 2011 [2a]; Wiskemann et al., 2011 [2b]) </li>
        <li>Exercises dealing with strength, balance/coordination and flexibility (Wolin et al., 2010 [1a]; Wiskemann &amp; Huber, 2008 [1b]; Knols et al., 2011 [2a]; Wiskemann et al., 2011 [2b])
        <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: The exercise program is designed to reduce fatigue, improve physical function and positively affect QoL (Wiskemann et al., 2011 [2b]).</p>
        <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: A minimum frequency and duration (i.e., 2x/week for 6 to 12 weeks) may be beneficial at this stage of recovery (Knols et al., 2005 [1a]; Local Consensus, 2013 [5]; Hayes et al., 2004).</p>
        <p><strong>Note 3</strong>: A moderate intensity exercise program for 30 to 60 minutes may include:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Aerobic exercise starting at 50% to 60% and increasing up to 70% to 80% of the heart rate max and a RPE up to 15 </li>
            <li>Strengthening/stretching exercises at an RPE of 10 to 13 (Knols et al., 2011 [2a]; Local Consensus, 2013 [5]) </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>It is recommended that during outpatient program following HSCT a physical therapist provide interventions to promote functional mobility, including transfers, walking and stair climbing (Knols et al., 2011 [2a]; Local Consensus, 2013 [5]). </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This Best Evidence Statement addresses only key points of care for the target population; it is not intended to be a comprehensive practice guideline. These recommendations result from review of literature and practices current at the time of their formulation. This Best Evidence Statement does not preclude using care modalities proven efficacious in studies published subsequent to the current revision of this document. This document is not intended to impose standards of care preventing selective variances from the recommendations to meet the specific and unique requirements of individual patients. Adherence to this Statement is voluntary. The clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient must make the ultimate judgment regarding the priority of any specific procedure.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Applicability Issues</strong></p>
<p>Hemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients need to be identified early by members of the health care team in order to facilitate referral for physical therapy (PT) evaluation of appropriate patients in the pre-HSCT phase. Hindrances to early referral may include patient geographic location, medical status and schedule conflicts within the HSCT work-up.</p>
<p>Exercise intervention should be provided by physical therapists who have knowledge of the HSCT process. Additional staffing resources need to be identified, to cover the demands for high utilization of therapy resources.</p>
<p>Collaboration and planning is required to expedite management of patient care across inpatient and outpatient settings, including appropriate notification, referral and sharing of information by inpatient and outpatient physical therapists.</p></div>
