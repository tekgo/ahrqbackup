<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The removal of any pressure to not perform a cesarean birth has led to a skyrocketing of state and national cesarean section (C-section) rates. There are no data that higher rates improve any outcomes, yet the C-section rates continue to rise. This measure seeks to focus attention on the most variable portion of the C-section epidemic, the term labor C-sections in nulliparous women. This population segment accounts for the large majority of the variable portion of the C-section rate, and is the area most affected by subjectivity.</p>
<p>There are clear cut quality improvement activities that can be done to address the differences. Over 60% of the variation among providers can be attributed to first birth labor induction rates and first birth early labor admission rates (Main et al., 2006). The results showed if labor was forced when the cervix was not ready the outcomes were poorer. Labor and delivery guidelines can make a difference in labor outcomes (Alfirevic, Edwards, &amp; Platt, 2004). Many authors have shown that physician factors, rather than patient characteristics or obstetric diagnoses are the major driver for the difference in rates (Berkowitz et al., 1989; Goyert et al., 1989; Luthy et al., 2003).</p>
<p>Safe and healthy pregnancies and births are a primary goal for society and particularly for expectant mothers and their families, healthcare providers, and payers. While most births are positive experiences with healthy outcomes, childbirth also brings substantial risks for both the mother and the infant. </p>
<p>For consumers, Minnesota lacks publicly reported maternity measures to aid and inform decision making. Several other states have public reporting for maternity care measures, most commonly C-section and vaginal birth after C-section delivery (VBAC) rates due to the high volume, high costs and increased morbidity associated with C-section procedures.</p>
<p>Recently, new clinical guidelines offering more direction regarding the care and management of pregnant women and childbirth have been released along with new quality measures that can be used to highlight variation and underscore appropriate maternal care.</p></div>
