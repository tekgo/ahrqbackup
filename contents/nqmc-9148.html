<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the rate of pediatric patients up-to-date with Level I preventive services.</p>
<p>Level I preventive services are worthy of attention at every opportunity. Busy clinicians cannot deliver this many services in any single encounter. However, with systems in place to track whether or not patients are up-to-date with the high-priority preventive services for their age group, clinicians can recommend the high-priority services as opportunities present.</p>
<p>Level II services have been shown to be effective and should be recommended whenever possible. If systems/care management teams are successful in keeping patients on time with high-priority services during illness and disease management visits, preventive services in the second group can be delivered.</p>
<p>Vision screening should be recommended for all children three to five years of age. Screening should be used to detect amblyopia, strabismus and defects in visual acuity.</p>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is adequate evidence that early treatment for amblyopia, including the use of cycloplegic agents, patching, and eyeglasses for children three to five years of age leads to improved visual outcomes. The effectiveness of screening in preschool children is supported by indirect evidence that screening is effective in identifying strabismus and amblyopia, treatment of strabismus and amblyopia is effective, and more intensive screening leads to improved visual acuity compared to usual screening.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) has long had a policy of transparency in declaring potential conflicting and competing interests of all individuals who participate in the development, revision and approval of ICSI guidelines and protocols. </p>
<p>In 2010, the ICSI Conflict of Interest Review Committee was established by the Board of Directors to review all disclosures and make recommendations to the board when steps should be taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, including recommendations regarding removal of work group members. This committee has adopted the Institute of Medicine Conflict of Interest standards as outlined in the report Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2011). </p>
<p>Where there are work group members with identified potential conflicts, these are disclosed and discussed at the initial work group meeting. These members are expected to recuse themselves from related discussions or authorship of related recommendations, as directed by the Conflict of Interest committee or requested by the work group.</p>
