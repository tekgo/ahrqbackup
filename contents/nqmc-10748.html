<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence to date suggests that complication measures are less sensitive to hospital characteristics, after adjusting for severity of illness, than mortality based measures. This is an underlying assumption of failure to rescue (FTR) theory&mdash;complications are undesirable outcome measures because they reflect underlying patient severity and diagnosis coding more than they reflect hospital care. Instead, a hospital's quality is put to the test when a patient develops a complication, and whether a patient is salvaged after a complication will be a function of the care delivered by the hospital and its knowledge base, depth, and facilities. Thus, "good" hospitals will rescue patients by identifying complications quickly and treating them aggressively, resulting in lower FTR. Although many "failures," just like deaths, are often not preventable, we have argued that FTR may be a better measure for comparing hospital quality because of better severity adjustment properties, and because of its focus on hospital actions. By studying a population of patients who, by definition, have already developed a complication, the specifics of severity of illness adjustment becomes less important in failure rate analyses, because all patients have experienced complications and thus are more uniformly ill.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Split half sample reliability had a correlation of 0.39, similar to in-hospital mortality (0.36).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Marginal and partial coefficients in logit models using detailed patient characteristics and hospital characteristics shown to be associated with better outcomes in previous studies (Silber et al., 2007; Aiken et al., 2002). The marginal results use one hospital characteristic at a time along with all patient characteristics. "Partial" regression results, using all hospital and patient variables simultaneously have the disadvantage that correlation between hospital characteristics can cause difficulty in interpreting the effects of individual hospital variables. The following hospital characteristics have been shown to be associated with better outcomes: (1) teaching hospital status (member of the American Council of Teaching Hospitals); (2) high technology status (does the hospital perform open heart surgery or perform organ transplantation); (3) hospital size greater than 200/250 beds; (4) bed-to-nurse ratio (where nurses are the sum of registered nurse [RN] plus licensed practical nurse [LPN] full-time equivalent [FTE] positions); and (5) nursing skill mix (the ratio of RN/[RN+LPN]) (Silber et al., 2007; Silber et al., 1995; Silber et al., 1997; Silber et al., 2000; Silber et al., 2002; Aiken et al., 2002; Aiken et al., 2003). </li>
    <li>The relative contribution of patient-to-hospital characteristics that predicted each outcome of interest, as provided by the omega statistic (Silber et al., 2007; Silber, Rosenbaum, &amp; Ross, 1995). The omega statistic computes a ratio of the squared sum of the log odds for model patent variables divided by a similar quantity calculated for the model hospital variables. All else being equal, outcome measures that have lower omega ratios may be more desirable quality indicators, since the lower the omega, the greater the hospital's impact on outcome relative to the patient's impact. This is especially important if modeling patient severity is difficult (as with claims data) so that the lower the omega suggests the higher relative influence of hospital characteristics as compared to patient characteristics. </li>
