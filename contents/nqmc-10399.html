<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess average change between pre-operative and one year (9 to 15 months) post-operative health related quality of life as measured with the EQ-5D-5L.</p>
<p>This health related quality of life measure will be reported as separate rates (stratified) for primary knee replacement and for revision knee replacement.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Annually there are over 500,000 total knee replacement procedures performed in the United States (U.S.). It is projected that by 2030, the volume of this procedure will increase to over 3.48 million per year due to the aging baby-boomers, increased obesity and indications for total knee replacement that extend to both younger as well as older patients (Kurtz, 2006). From 2000 to 2006, the Medicare total knee replacement rate overall in the U.S. increased by 58%, from 5.5 to 8.7 per 1,000 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009). Total knee replacement revisions currently represent 8.2% of all Medicare dollars spent (Ong et al., 2006). During this same timeframe, total knee replacement rates in Minnesota regions increased from 7.2 to 8.6 per 1,000 to 10.8 to 12.9 per 1,000 (Fisher et al., 2010). It is estimated that annual hospital charges for total knee replacement will approach 40.8 billion dollars annually by 2015 (Kurtz et al., 2007). </p>
<p>For consumers, there is a lack of publicly reported information that would provide patients with an understanding of potentially how well they will function after having total knee replacement surgery. These measures will provide outcome data for patients that currently does not exist.</p></div>
