<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of recommendation (<strong>strong</strong> or <strong>weak/conditional</strong>) and levels of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low</strong> or <strong>very low</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does epidural analgesia (I) versus nonregional modalities of pain control (C) (i.e., intravenous or enteral analgesics such as opioids, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma, the guideline authors <strong>conditionally recommend</strong> epidural analgesia over nonregional modalities of pain control (i.e., intravenous or enteral analgesics such as opioids, acetaminophen, NSAIDs) for the treatment of pain. This recommendation is based on <strong>very low-quality evidence</strong> but places a high value on patient preferences for analgesia. If certain confounders (or effect modifiers) such as age, number of rib fractures, or severity of injury are considered, a stronger positive magnitude of effect may be observed for certain outcomes of interest.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does paravertebral block (I) versus nonregional modalities of pain control (C) (i.e., intravenous or enteral analgesics such as opioids, acetaminophen, NSAIDs) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>It is important to note that paravertebral block had equivalent pain control compared with epidural analgesia and provided significant pain relief compared with baseline. While desirable consequences probably outweigh undesirable consequences, because of the lack of studies comparing paravertebral block to nonregional pain control modalities, the guideline authors are <strong>unable to make a recommendation</strong> regarding the use of paravertebral blocks.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does continuous intrapleural infusions of local anesthetics (I) versus other regional modalities of pain control (C) (i.e., epidural or paravertebral nerve blocks) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is limited available literature regarding intrapleural analgesia for blunt thoracic trauma. The few studies that were identified were of very poor methodological quality. Because of <strong>insufficient evidence</strong>, the guideline authors are <strong>unable to make a recommendation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does multimodal analgesia (I) (i.e., use of different classes of analgesics, including combinations of opioids with other agents such as NSAIDs, pregabalin/gabapentin, acetaminophen) compared with opioids alone (C) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Although the quality and quantity of evidence for the use of multimodal analgesia in adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma are very limited, the guideline authors <strong>conditionally recommend</strong> this modality. This recommendation is based on <strong>very low-quality evidence</strong> but places a high value on patient preferences for analgesia. There is some indirect evidence that multiple analgesic modalities (i.e., transdermal fentanyl, NSAIDs), when combined, decrease pain in patients with blunt thoracic trauma. Use of alternative agents for patients with refractory pain is consistent with the clinical experience of the group, as patients often seek alternatives when a standard sole opioid regimen fails. Moreover, standard sole opioid regimens are often associated with adverse effects, especially as doses are escalated, thus requiring consideration for additional nonopioid analgesics.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PICO Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p>In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does continuous intercostal infusions of local anesthetics (I) versus nonregional modalities of pain control (C) (i.e., intravenous or enteral analgesics such as opioids, acetaminophen, NSAIDs) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Because of the lack of studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, no evidence profile was created. Because of <strong>insufficient evidence</strong>, the guideline authors are <strong>unable to make a recommendation</strong>.</p>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inclusion Criteria for This Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Study Types</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control studies, and prospective or retrospective observational cohort studies (with a comparator group). Reviews containing no original data or comments were excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Participant Types (Population, P)</strong></p>
<p>Only studies pertaining to the treatment of hospitalized patients with blunt thoracic trauma were included. Blunt thoracic trauma was defined as chest wall injuries such as rib fracture, flail chest, sternal fracture, and soft tissue contusion; intrapleural lesions such as hemothorax and pneumothorax; parenchymal lung injuries such as pulmonary contusion and lung laceration; and mediastinal lesions such as blunt cardiac injury or great vessel injury. The guideline authors included studies of adult patients (&gt;16 years of age) without restricting gender, ethnicity, or degree of comorbidity.</p>
<p><strong>Intervention Type (I)</strong></p>
<p>The guideline authors included studies in which regional anesthetic techniques, such as epidural or paravertebral catheters, intercostal nerve blocks, multimodal approaches (i.e., opioids plus pregabalin/gabapentin, or other nonregional drug combinations), or intrapleural infusions of anesthetics, were used compared with nonregional techniques such as use of intravenous or enteral analgesics (i.e., opioids, acetaminophen, NSAIDs).</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measure Types (O)</strong></p>
<p>Outcomes were chosen by group consensus as recommended by the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Outcomes were chosen by the committee and rated in importance from 1 to 9, with scores of 7 to 9 representing critical outcomes and scores of 4 to 6 representing important outcomes. Critical outcomes for all five PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions included analgesia (as measured by a validated pain scale such as the visual analog scale), postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), and pulmonary function as evidenced by objective measures, requirement for intubation, and mortality. Important outcomes included hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Additional outcomes considered by the committee were cost, ventilator days, and labor-intensiveness.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review Methods</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, MEDLINE (OVID), and The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials electronic databases was performed by the primary author for studies published from January 1967 to October 2015. A systematic search of the National Institutes of Health MEDLINE database was performed using PubMed. Search terms included the following: <em>Epidural Analgesia</em> [MeSH], <em>thoracic epidural analgesia, thoracic epidural, blunt thoracic trauma, Thoracic Injuries</em> [majr], <em>pneumothorax, hemothorax, rib fracture(s), sternal fracture, chest contusion, Randomized Controlled Trial [Publication Type], Cohort Studies</em> [MeSH], <em>Case-control Studies</em> [majr], <em>Mortality</em> [MeSH], <em>Hospital Mortality</em> [MeSH], <em>reintubation, pneumonia</em> [MeSH], <em>Pulmonary Atelectasis</em> [majr], <em>Respiratory Function Tests</em> [MeSH], <em>Analgesia</em> [MeSH], <em>Analgesia, Patient-controlled</em> [MeSH], <em>Pain Measurement</em> [MeSH], <em>Length of Stay</em> [MeSH], <em>postoperative pulmonary contusions</em>. A similar systematic search of the EMBASE database was performed using the following search terms (including Emtree mapping terms): <em>epidural anesthesia, thorax blunt trauma, blunt</em> AND <em>thoracic</em> AND <em>trauma, pneumothorax, hemothorax, lung</em> AND <em>contusion, pulmonary</em> AND <em>contusion, flail chest, chest</em> AND <em>contusion, thoracic</em> AND <em>epidural</em> AND <em>analgesia, epidural</em> OR <em>regional</em> AND <em>anesthesia, postoperative complications, reintubation, randomized controlled trial, cohort analysis, case control study</em>. For PICO Questions 2 to 5, the searches were adjusted accordingly, using terms for the analgesic intervention of interest (i.e., "epidural analgesia" was replaced with "paravertebral block," etc.). The methodology for the MEDLINE and EMBASE searches was used to conduct searches in The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and CINAHL. Non-English articles, when included, were reviewed by multilingual members of the research team. In addition to the electronic search, the guideline authors manually searched the bibliographies of included studies and recent review articles.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>All 28 studies included in the guideline for recommendations were analyzed qualitatively, whereas only 12 of these studies could be included for quantitative analysis (meta-analysis). All 12 studies analyzed quantitatively pertained to Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Question 1. For PICO Questions 2, 4, and 5, although no articles that met the strict inclusion criteria for evaluation could be found, a qualitative review was performed for articles that were tangentially pertinent to this recommendation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of the Quality of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The quality of the evidence for each outcome in a PICO was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered high-quality evidence, the guideline authors rated down for quality if there were concerns that lowered their certainty in the estimate of effect for that outcome. The guideline authors evaluated for risk of bias, inconsistency (also referred to at heterogeneity), indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations (e.g., publication bias). Observational studies, by default, were considered low-quality evidence, but could be rated up under the following circumstances: large effect, dose-response gradient, or if all possible confounders would decrease an effect or move the effect in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk-of-Bias Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Risk of bias was assessed for each outcome using the instrument developed by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Jadad Scale. The Cochrane instrument includes the domains of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and baseline imbalance and bias due to vested financial interest. The Jadad score, which assesses randomization, blinding, and patient withdrawals/dropouts, was used to grade included studies with a score between 0 and 5. For nonrandomized studies, the Downs and Black assessment tool was used. This instrument includes assessment items for reporting bias, external validity, internal validity, confounding, and selection bias. For both the Cochrane and Downs and Black assessment tools, if one or more domains were judged as being high or unclear, the guideline authors classified the trial as having a high risk of bias. Systematic reviews were assessed with the AMSTAR instrument, a tool designed to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical Analyses</span></strong></p>
<p>When a quantitative analysis was indicated, the guideline authors calculated relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcome measures and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcome measures using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model. These measures were pooled in conventional cumulative meta-analyses for each critical and important outcome included in this recommendation. Heterogeneity, or inconsistency, was assessed using the <em>I&sup2;</em> statistic (inconsistency factor). An <em>I&sup2;</em> value more than 50% was suggestive of moderate heterogeneity, and a value greater than 75% indicated substantial heterogeneity due to real differences in protocols, trial populations, interventions, and/or outcomes. The meta-analysis was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration's "Revman" software (version 5.3; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Evidence tables were created using the GRADE Working Group's open access Guideline Development Tool (May 25, 2015, update; Evidence Prime, Inc., Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). All tests were two-tailed, and <em>p</em> &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline has been developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework adopted by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The GRADE framework, now in use by more than 90 international societies and organizations worldwide, provides a systematic and transparent framework for clarifying questions, determining the outcomes of interest, summarizing the evidence for such questions, and moving from evidence to a recommendation or decision. Importantly, within GRADE, the evidence is rated not according to each individual study, but across studies for specific patient-important clinical outcomes. Recommendation strength and direction are based not only on evidence quality but also on the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes and patient values and preference.</p>
<p>The Population (P), Intervention (I), Comparator (C), and Outcome (O) (PICO) questions are defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 1</strong>: In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does epidural analgesia (I) versus nonregional modalities of pain control (C) (i.e., intravenous or enteral analgesics such as opioids, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 2</strong>: In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does paravertebral blockade (I) versus nonregional modalities of pain control (C) (i.e., intravenous or enteral analgesics such as opioids, acetaminophen, NSAIDs) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 3</strong>: In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does continuous intrapleural infusions of local anesthetics (I) versus other regional modalities of pain control (C) (i.e., epidural or paravertebral nerve blocks) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 4</strong>: In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does multimodal analgesia (I) (i.e., use of different classes of analgesics, including combinations of opioids with other agents such as NSAIDs, pregabalin/gabapentin, acetaminophen) compared with opioids alone (C) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p>
<p><strong>PICO Question 5</strong>: In adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma (P), does continuous intercostal infusions of local anesthetics (I) versus nonregional modalities of pain control (C) (i.e., intravenous or enteral analgesics such as opioids, acetaminophen, NSAIDs) improve analgesia, decrease pulmonary complications and need for mechanical ventilation, shorten length of stay, and/or decrease mortality (O)?</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Pain is acknowledged as a contributing element for much of the morbidity associated with blunt thoracic trauma, and optimization of analgesia is an essential component of a strategy that uses early mobilization and chest physiotherapy to enhance recovery.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Epidural analgesia is associated with potentially troublesome adverse effects such as hypotension, and is technically demanding. Historical concerns about epidural analgesia include loss of lower-extremity sensation, a requirement for bladder catheterization, and venous pooling, which might precipitate deep venous thrombosis. </li>
    <li>Standard sole opioid regimens are often associated with adverse effects, especially as doses are escalated, thus requiring consideration for additional nonopioid analgesics. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad Hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment </li>
    <li>These guidelines represent a detailed summary and comprehensive overview of the literature regarding analgesia for blunt thoracic trauma. They are meant to inform the decision-making process and not replace clinical judgment. The overall risk of bias for all studies was high (see Figure 5 in the original guideline document), with the exception of a few small, underpowered studies. The limitations with the available literature precluded the formulation of strong recommendations by the panel (see Table 3 in the original guideline document). </li>
