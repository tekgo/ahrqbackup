<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendations (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Level II</strong></p>
<p>Spinal immobilization of all trauma patients with a cervical spine or spinal cord injury or with a mechanism of injury having the potential to cause cervical spinal injury is recommended.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Triage of patients with potential spinal injury at the scene by trained and experienced emergency medical services (EMS) personnel to determine the need for immobilization during transport is recommended. </li>
    <li>Immobilization of trauma patients who are awake, alert, and are not intoxicated; who are without neck pain or tenderness; who do not have an abnormal motor or sensory examination; and who do not have any significant associated injury that might detract from their general evaluation is not recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level III</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A combination of a rigid cervical collar and supportive blocks on a backboard with straps is effective in limiting motion of the cervical spine and is recommended. </li>
    <li>The longstanding practice of attempted spinal immobilization with sandbags and tape is insufficient and is not recommended. </li>
    <li>Spinal immobilization in patients with penetrating trauma is not recommended because of increased mortality from delayed resuscitation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>Spinal immobilization can reduce untoward movement of the cervical spine and can reduce the likelihood of neurological deterioration in patients with unstable cervical spinal injuries after trauma. Immobilization of the entire spinal column is necessary in these patients until a spinal cord injury (or multiple injuries) has been excluded or until appropriate treatment has been initiated. Although immobilization of the cervical spine after trauma is not supported by <strong>Class I</strong> or <strong>II</strong> medical evidence, this effective, time-tested practice is based on anatomic and mechanical considerations in an attempt to prevent spinal cord injury and is supported by years of cumulative trauma and triage clinical experience.</p>
<p>Not all trauma patients must be treated with spinal immobilization during prehospital resuscitation and transport. Many patients do not have spinal injuries and therefore do not require such intervention. The development of specific selection criteria for those patients for whom immobilization is indicated remains an area of investigation. Current publications on the use of contemporary, well-defined EMS triage protocols provide <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence for their utility.</p>
<p>The variety of techniques used and the lack of definitive evidence to advocate a uniform device for spinal immobilization make immobilization technique and device recommendations difficult. It appears that a combination of a rigid cervical collar with supportive blocks on a rigid backboard with straps and tape to immobilize the entire body is effective at achieving safe, effective spinal immobilization for transport. The longstanding practice of attempted spinal immobilization with sandbags and tape with the patient strapped to a rigid backboard is not sufficient and is not recommended.</p>
<p>Cervical spine immobilization devices are effective but can result in patient morbidity. Spinal immobilization devices should be used to achieve the goals of spinal stability for safe extrication and transport. They should be removed as soon as a definitive evaluation is accomplished and/or definitive management is initiated. Spinal immobilization of trauma patients with penetrating injuries is not recommended.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A National Library of Medicine computerized literature search from 1966 to 2011 was conducted with the terms "spinal injuries" and "immobilization." The search was limited to human subjects and the English language and yielded no articles. A second search combining the terms "spinal injuries" and "transportation of patients" yielded 81 articles. A third search combining the terms "spinal injuries" and "emergency medical services" produced 331 articles. Additional references were culled from the reference lists of the remaining papers. Finally, the author group was asked to contribute articles known to them on the subject matter that were not found by other search criteria. Duplicate references were discarded. The abstracts were reviewed and articles unrelated to the specific topic were eliminated. This process yielded a total of 109 articles for this review, which are listed in the bibliography in the original guideline document.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A more uniform, universally accepted method for prehospital spinal immobilization for patients with potential spinal injury after trauma may reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of prehospital spinal injury management.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Cervical spinal immobilization has a few potential drawbacks. Immobilization can be uncomfortable; it can be difficult to apply properly; it takes time to apply; application may delay transport; and it is associated with modest morbidity. </li>
    <li>Morbidity is more likely to occur when concomitant head injury exists, in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, and in the setting of delayed resuscitation. </li>
    <li>Refer to the "Safety of Prehospital Spinal Immobilization" section in the original guideline document for more information. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
</ul>
