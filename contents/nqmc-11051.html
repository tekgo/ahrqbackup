<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of female patients aged 18 years and older with Stage I (T1b) through IIIC, estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) positive breast cancer who were prescribed tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) during the 12-month reporting period. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Despite evidence suggesting the role of adjuvant endocrine therapy in lowering the risk of tumor recurrence, many female patients who should be receiving this therapy are not. </p>
<p>This measure assesses whether patients with a certain stage of breast cancer [I (T1b) through IIIC] and estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) positive (ER/PR+) are currently receiving the therapy. </p>
<p>There are allowable medical, patient, and system reasons to document instances in which a woman with Stage I (T1b) through IIIC, ER/PR+ may not be a candidate for the therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statement</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;" start="1">
    <li>Women diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who are pre- or perimenopausal should be offered adjuvant endocrine therapy with:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>Tamoxifen for an initial duration of 5 years. </li>
        <li>After 5 years, women should receive additional therapy based on menopausal status.
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;" start="1">
            <li>If women are pre- or perimenopausal, or if menopausal status is unknown or cannot be determined, they should be offered continued tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years. </li>
            <li>If women have become definitively postmenopausal, they should be offered continued tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years or switching to up to 5 years of an aromatase inhibitor (AI), for a total duration of up to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Women diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who are postmenopausal should be offered adjuvant endocrine therapy with one of the following options:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>Tamoxifen for a duration of 10 years Or </li>
        <li>An AI for a duration of 5 years. There are insufficient data currently to recommend an AI for a duration of greater than 5 years. Or </li>
        <li>Tamoxifen for an initial duration of 5 years, then switching to an AI for up to 5 years, for a total duration of up to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Or </li>
        <li>Tamoxifen for a duration of 2 to 3 years and switching to an AI for up to 5 years, for a total duration of up to 7 to 8 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Women who are postmenopausal and are intolerant of either tamoxifen or an AI should be offered the alternative type of adjuvant endocrine therapy.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>If women have received an AI but discontinued treatment at less than 5 years, they may be offered tamoxifen for a total of 5 years. </li>
        <li>If women have received tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years, they should be offered switching to an AI for up to 5 years, for a total duration of up to 7 to 8 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Women who have received 5 years of tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy should be offered additional adjuvant endocrine treatment.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>If women are postmenopausal, they should be offered continued tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years or switching to up to 5 years AI, for a total duration of up to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. </li>
        <li>If women are pre- or perimenopausal, or menopausal status cannot be ascertained, they should be offered 5 additional years of tamoxifen, for a total duration of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (Burstein et al., 2014). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Patients with invasive breast cancers that are ER- or PR-positive should be considered for adjuvant endocrine therapy regardless of patient age, lymph node status, or whether adjuvant chemotherapy is to be administered (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2015).</p>
<p>The most firmly established adjuvant endocrine therapy is tamoxifen for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In women with ER-positive breast cancer, adjuvant tamoxifen decreases the annual odds of recurrence by 39% and the annual odds of death by 31% irrespective of the use of chemotherapy, patient age, menopausal status, or axillary lymph node (ALN) status. In patients receiving both tamoxifen and chemotherapy, chemotherapy should be given first, followed by sequential tamoxifen. Prospective, randomized trials have demonstrated that 5 years of tamoxifen is more effective than 1 to 2 years of tamoxifen (NCCN, 2015). </p>
<p>Patients with lymph node involvement or with tumors greater than 1 cm in diameter are appropriate candidates for adjuvant systemic therapy. For women with lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-negative tumors greater than 1 cm in diameter, chemotherapy is recommended. For those with lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer tumors greater than 0.5 cm, the panel recommends endocrine therapy with the consideration of chemotherapy (NCCN, 2015). </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a measure testing project in 2011 with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), to ensure the <em>Breast Cancer: Hormonal Therapy for Stage IC-IIIC Estrogen Receptor/Progesterone Receptor (ER/PR) Positive Breast Cancer</em> measure was reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator and exception case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing chart data. Inter-rater reliability was tested. Five sites participated in the testing of the measures. Two sites were in urban settings, two sites were in suburban settings, and one had multiple practice sites in urban, rural and suburban settings. Site A was a hospital-based practice with 21 physicians. Site B was a physician-owned private practice with four physicians. Site C was a physician-owned private practice with 41 physicians. Site D was an academic practice with nine physicians. Site E was an academic practice with 14 physicians.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from chart records were used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the measures. </p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing Results</strong></p>
<p>There were 156 observations from five sites used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide-by-zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used. </p>
<p>Of the 156 observations that were initially selected, 156 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide-by-zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval)</span><br />
Denominator: 156, 100.00%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)*<br />
Numerator: 156, 100.00%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)*<br />
Exceptions: 156, 100.00%, Non-Calculable (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)*</p>
<p>This measure demonstrates perfect reliability, as shown in results from the above analysis. </p>
<p class="Note">*Cannot calculate kappa statistics when only one response (Yes/Yes) was used, as this causes a divide-by-zero error in the statistic formula.</p></div>
