Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of individuals aged 50 to 74 years who had a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) performed during the measurement year or a colonoscopy during the previous nine years (including the measurement year).</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In Israel, approximately 5% of the population is susceptible to rectal and intestinal cancer. This type of cancer is responsible for one-tenth of fatalities due to malignant disease. Cancer mortality can be reduced with early detection. For the general population of individuals aged 50 to 74 years at standard risk, the Ministry of Health recommends performing a yearly fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (Ministry of Health, 2014). FOBT is an evidence-based method shown to reduce colon cancer mortality (Hewitson et al., 2008). Another evidence-based method shown to reduce colon cancer mortality includes the flexible sigmoidoscopy (Atkin et al., 2010), however this test is rarely done in Israel since colonoscopy is the preferred visual inspection method. Colonoscopy is an optical examination that enables a visual inspection of the colon to detect colonic lesions, biopsy the colon, and the remove of polyps. This examination is recommended following positive results from an FOBT, as well as for people at high risk due to family history, people who suffer from pain or discomfort in the digestive system, and those with previous colon complications. The colonoscopy screen is a highly effective tool for the diagnosis of pre-cancerous tumors. In the general population of individuals aged 50 to 74 years, some groups often recommend a colonoscopy once every few years as a screening test for colon cancer (instead of an FOBT) (Telford et al., 2010); unfortunately, the rate of its use is low due to the discomfort caused by the examination. In Israel there are no formal recommendations for colonoscopy examinations.</p></div>
