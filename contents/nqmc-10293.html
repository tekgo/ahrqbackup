<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>State health agencies, which are vested with the legal authority to require disease reporting and collect health data, play a central role in public health surveillance. Whereas public health surveillance was once focused primarily on infectious diseases, it has expanded in recent years to include surveillance of a wide range of health outcomes and their determinants, including chronic diseases, injuries and health behaviors (Halperin &amp; Horan, 1998). National statistics on occupational injuries and illnesses have been collected largely outside of the public health infrastructure and rely almost entirely on data reported by employers. State health agencies that have access to a wide variety of public health data systems have an important role in the surveillance of occupational diseases, injuries and hazards.</p>
<p>Pneumoconiosis frequency varies geographically being largely determined by local industrial activities and migration of affected individuals. Control of occupational dust exposure is the single most effective means of preventing pneumoconiosis. Tracking of pneumoconiosis is essential for tracking progress towards elimination of the disease, as well as for targeting prevention and disease management programs.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure
</h2>

<h3>
Type of Evidence Supporting the Criterion of Quality for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
A formal consensus procedure, involving experts in relevant clinical, methodological,  public health and organizational sciences
</div>
<div class='FieldValue'>
One or more research studies published in a National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexed, peer-reviewed journal

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Nearly all pneumoconioses are attributable to occupational exposure, and millions of workers are at risk. Common types include asbestosis, coal workers' pneumoconiosis, and silicosis. Pneumoconiosis is more commonly listed as a contributing cause of death than as the underlying cause of death. Consequently, this indicator monitors all listed causes of death on the death certificate.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 1998, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), in association with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), convened the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group to make recommendations to NIOSH concerning State-based surveillance activities for the coming decade. </p>
<p>The Work Group recognized the need to pilot test 19 indicators to assess the feasibility of widespread implementation and to develop specific guidance on how to compute the proposed measures. In summer 2002, the five "Core" states with NIOSH Cooperative Agreements to conduct "Core Occupational Health Surveillance" (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Washington) agreed to pilot test the indicators and to create user-friendly "how-to" guides so that other states could calculate the indicators. </p>
<p>Subsequent to the initial pilot testing by the five "Core" states, eight additional states (Connecticut, Maine, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin) pilot tested the "how-to" guides. Feedback from these additional states was incorporated into the development of the final "how-to" guides for 19 indicators in November 2004.</p>
<p>Procedures to review, approve, and implement new indicators were developed by the Work Group. In 2013, a fourteenth health effect indicator (<em>Asthma among Adults Caused or Made Worse by Work</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-first indicator. In 2014, a fifteenth health effect indicator (<em>Work-Related Severe Traumatic Injury Hospitalizations</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-second indicator. </p></div>
