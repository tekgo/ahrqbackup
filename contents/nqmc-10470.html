<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C with whom a physician or other qualified healthcare professional reviewed the range of treatment options appropriate to their genotype and demonstrated a shared decision making approach with the patient.</p>
<p>To meet the measure, there must be documentation in the patient record of a discussion between the physician or other qualified healthcare professional and the patient that includes all of the following: treatment choices appropriate to genotype, risks and benefits, evidence of effectiveness, and patient preferences toward treatment.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Shared decision making has the potential to provide numerous benefits for patients, clinicians, and the health care system, including increased patient knowledge, less anxiety over the care process, improved health outcomes, reductions in unwarranted variation in care and costs, and greater alignment of care with patients' values (Oshima Lee &amp; Emanuel, 2013). In hepatitis C, the decision about whether to initiate treatment is sensitive to patient preferences about achieving cure and limiting symptoms versus tolerating side effects of medications (Cotler et al., 2001). It is also intuitive that patients are more likely to be adherent to treatment if they are engaged in the decision to start. Numerous studies have documented problems with patient-physician communication in this population (Zickmund et al., 2004), and patient misperceptions and lack of education have been implicated as barriers to treatment (Zickmund, Brown, &amp; Bielefeldt, 2007; Richmond, Dunning, &amp; Desmond, 2007; McNally et al., 2006). For these reasons, it is likely that shared decision making would improve decision quality, result in more effective antiviral therapy, and better patient health outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>: </p>
<p>The decision to defer treatment for a specific patient should consider the patient's preferences and priorities, the natural history and risk of progression, the presence of co-morbidities, and the patient's age (European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2014).</p>
<p>Treatment decisions should be individualized based on the severity of liver disease, the potential for serious side effects, the likelihood of treatment response, the presence of comorbid conditions, and the patient's readiness for treatment (Ghany et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The Institute of Medicine (2001) endorses shared decision making and the strongly recommends use of decision aids as a way to foster patient-centered care. </p></div>
