Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children who live in neighborhoods or communities perceived as safe, based on parents' response to the following question on the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>K10Q40: How often do you feel that [child] is safe in your community or neighborhood? Would you say never, sometimes, usually, or always?
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Response choices for the above question are "Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always," "Don't know," and "Refused." </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Perceived neighborhood safety is important to all children, particularly populations of vulnerable children. Neighborhood safety has both direct and mediated impacts on child health. Increasing perceived safety of neighborhoods can lead to increased child welfare indicators, such as overall child health. </p>
<p>Parental perception of neighborhood safety is also important to assess. Neighborhood safety and characteristics have been shown to correlate with several important health indicators. Perception of safety has particular relevance to whether or not children are allowed to play outside and engage in other out-of-door activities. </p>
<p>Feeling safe and secure in all residential neighborhoods is a major policy goal and is included in Healthy People 2010 guidelines. Nationally, 11.0% of parents of children age 0-17 years only sometimes feel safe in their community, and 2.4% of parents feel that their children are never safe in their community. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted testing of the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) to make sure the entire survey instrument was functioning properly. A total of 95,677 surveys were completed nationally for children between the ages of 0 and 17 years. The questionnaire was then revised and finalized based on feedback from participants in these interviews.</p>
<p>The Maternal and Child Health Bureau leads the development of the NSCH and National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) survey and indicators, in collaboration with the NCHS and a national technical expert panel. The expert panel includes representatives from other federal agencies, state Title V leaders, family organizations, and child health researchers, and experts in all fields related to the surveys (adolescent health, family and neighborhoods, early childhood and development, etc.). Previously validated questions and scales are used when available. Extensive literature reviewing and expert reviewing of items is conducted for all aspects of the survey. Respondents' cognitive understanding of the survey questions is assessed during the pretest phase and revisions made as required. All final data components are verified by NCHS and Data Resource Center/Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (DRC/CAHMI) staff prior to public release. Face validity is conducted in comparing results with prior years of the survey and/or results from other implementations of items. No specific reliability results are available for this measure.</p></div>
