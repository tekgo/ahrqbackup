Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (I-III) and levels of recommendations (A-C) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Tubal occlusion by laparoscopy is a safe and effective method of permanent contraception. </li>
    <li>Tubal occlusion does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (including human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]). </li>
    <li>Compared with abdominal approaches to female sterilization, vasectomy is safer, more effective, and less expensive. </li>
    <li>Laparoscopic tubal occlusion is far more effective than short-term, user-dependent, reversible contraceptive methods, such as oral contraceptive pills, injections, and barrier methods. </li>
    <li>Long-acting methods of contraception, including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the contraceptive implant, are at least as effective as tubal occlusion and are associated with lower morbidity and mortality. </li>
    <li>Although pregnancy after a sterilization procedure is uncommon, there is substantial risk that any post-sterilization pregnancy will be ectopic. </li>
    <li>Patients who have undergone sterilization procedures have a lower ectopic risk than noncontraceptive users. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Hysteroscopic occlusion techniques, followed by a confirmatory hysterosalpingography (HSG), have at least equal if not superior efficacy to tubal occlusion done via laparoscopy or minilaparotomy. </li>
    <li>Hysteroscopic procedures require the use of an alternative method of contraception for at least 3 months after the procedure and until a confirmatory HSG indicates successful tubal occlusion. </li>
    <li>Postpartum partial salpingectomy is associated with lower failure rates than interval tubal occlusions done via laparoscopy. </li>
    <li>Laparoscopic tubal occlusion reduces the incidence of ovarian cancer. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Women should be counseled about the risk of failure, risk of regret, and alternatives (including long-acting reversible contraception [LARC] and vasectomy). In a well-informed woman, age and parity should not be a barrier to sterilization. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case&ndash;control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 1990-October 2012. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists were used.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Women</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Tubal occlusion via <em>laparoscopy</em> has a low overall complication rate, and procedure-related death is a rare event. This complication rate did not vary significantly according to the method of occlusion used. Intraoperative complications include unplanned major surgery needed because of a problem related to the tubal surgery, transfusion, or a life-threatening event. Postoperative complications include unintended major surgery, transfusion, febrile morbidity, a life-threatening event, or rehospitalization. Use of general anesthesia, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, obesity, and diabetes were independent predictors of complication. </li>
    <li>The disadvantages of <em>laparoscopy</em> include the risk of bowel, bladder, or major vessel injury. </li>
    <li>Monopolar <em>electrocoagulation</em> is associated with thermal bowel injury. </li>
    <li><em>Mechanical devices</em> are most likely to be effective when used to occlude a normal fallopian tube; tubal adhesions, thickened tubes, or dilated fallopian tubes may increase the risk of misapplication and subsequent failure. Spontaneous clip migration or expulsion is rare. </li>
    <li>For <em>all methods of sterilization</em> except postpartum partial salpingectomy, the probability of ectopic pregnancy was greater for women sterilized before age 30 years than for women sterilized at age 30 years or older. </li>
    <li>There is some concern that <em>salpingectomy</em> may adversely affect ovarian function. </li>
    <li>Although there are certain key indicators for future <em>regret</em>&mdash;such as young age (less than age 30) at the time of sterilization&mdash;many indicators of regret are part of individual social circumstances, which should be explored with the patient before a decision is made. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Men</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Minor complications of <em>vasectomy</em> include infection at the site of incision, bleeding, hematoma formation, granuloma formation, and epididymitis. Vasectomy-related major morbidity and mortality are extremely rare in the United States. </li>
    <li>Chronic testicular pain may rarely result from obstructive epididymitis or sperm granuloma. </li>

Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Hysteroscopic techniques are not indicated for sterilization after delivery or abortion. </li>
    <li>Minilaparotomy generally is reserved for postpartum procedures and rarely considered for patients at high risk of complications associated with laparoscopic procedures. </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: In 2011, the nickel sensitivity contraindication was removed from the Essure procedure instructions. Patients with nickel sensitivity are candidates for Essure and do not require preprocedure confirmatory skin testing. However, they should be counseled that microinserts do contain minute amounts of nickel, which are likely to be of no clinical significance.</p>
