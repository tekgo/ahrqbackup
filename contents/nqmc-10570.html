<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure uses survey data to assess the percentage of Medicare members 65 years of age and older as of January 1 of the measurement year who have ever received a pneumococcal vaccination.</p>
<p>This measure is collected by Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) using the Medicare CAHPS Survey (Medicare).</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Pneumonia infection is a common cause of illness and death in the elderly. Each year, pneumonia causes an estimated 40,000 deaths among adults in the United States (U.S.). Pneumonia accounts for more deaths than any other vaccine-preventable bacterial disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1997). The burden of this disease is high for older adults, but the potential for prevention is also high. Pneumonia infections result in significant health care costs each year, and vaccination is safe and effective.</p>
<p>The specifications for this measure are consistent with current recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (Bridges et al., 2002), which recommends pneumococcal vaccine for all individuals who are 65 and older to protect against infection. Many people are unaware of the need for flu shots; many seniors are unaware of the need for vaccination against pneumonia or they harbor misconceptions about the vaccinations' usefulness.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Pneumococcal disease is caused by bacteria and can result in a range of ailments, from mild ear infections to meningitis, sepsis and fatal pneumonia (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 2014). Adults over the age of 65 years, especially those with chronic illnesses, are at an increased risk for pneumococcal disease and death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014). </li>
    <li>In people over 65 years of age, pneumococcal disease causes approximately 242,000 hospitalizations and 16,000 deaths every year and results in $1.8 billion in health care costs (Huang et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>The percentage of adults 65 years of age and older who received a pneumococcal vaccination is 20.6 percent and 17.6 percent lower among the Hispanic population and the non-Hispanic black population, respectively, than the non-Hispanic white population (CDC, 2013). </li>
    <li>There are approximately 73 million adults in the United States who have an indication for pneumococcal vaccination, but have not yet been vaccinated (National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, 2012). </li>
    <li>The pneumococcal vaccination has been shown to be 56 percent to 81 percent effective at preventing disease (CDC, 1997). </li>
    <li>Pneumococcal disease in older adults can result in complications and death. The best way to prevent pneumococcal disease is by getting vaccinated. </li>
