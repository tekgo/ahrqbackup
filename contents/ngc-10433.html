<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Review of AIM Guideline References</strong></p>
<p>The first screening process identified 52 AIM Specialty Health (AIM) guideline references relevant to the guideline. A full-text review retained 38 references and 1 article was added from reference list.</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines Search</strong></p>
<p>A manual search of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) Web sites was conducted on February 3, 2014 yielding 9 systematic reviews and 17 guidelines. A National Guideline Clearinghouse search using the keywords "sleep apnea", "polysomnography", "sleep apnoea", "narcolepsy", and "positive airway pressure" was conducted on the same day, yielding 108 results. These searches resulted in 3 guidelines for full-text review. Two of these guidelines were added to the evidence tables.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Literature Update Search</strong></p>
<p>A manual search of the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI), Blue Cross Blue Shield Health Technology Assessment (BCBS HTA), Oregon Health Evidence Review Commission, Washington HTA Program, National Health Service (NHS) HTA Programme and of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), California committee, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for grey literature on February 4, 2014 gave 1 result and 5 reports, respectively. Two reports had full-text review and were added to the evidence tables. A PubMed/MEDLINE update search on the same day for literature published from January 2012 to February 2014, using keywords and index terms for polysomnography, home sleep testing, positive airway pressure treatment, oral appliances, and narcolepsy yielded 767 results. Fifty-four had abstract review and 2 articles were added through ongoing surveillance. Thirty-one of these articles had full-text review and 19 of these were added to the evidence tables.</p>
<p><strong>Research Process</strong></p>
<p>The research and development process is primarily conducted by the lead physician author with staff support, including medical librarians, and is overseen by the AIM members of the Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC). The resources considered during AIM Guidelines development can include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Professional Society Guidelines </li>
    <li>Professional Society Appropriateness Criteria </li>
    <li>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Comparative Effectiveness Guidance </li>
    <li>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) </li>
    <li>Initiatives sponsored by Specialty Licensing Boards </li>
</ul>
<p>Additional web-based searches for evidence-based clinical guidelines and appropriate use criteria may also be performed using the National Guideline Clearinghouse website. Searches of the primary literature for an AIM Guideline under review are also conducted using standard databases and clinical knowledge resources. Relevant evidence-based literature or information may be brought to AIM's attention at any time by providers, AIM's physician reviewers, committee members, or other interested parties. This additional information may warrant off-cycle review and modification to include clinically-important recommendations, in addition to the usual process as determined by the Chair of the CGC.</p>
<p>A database is used to track the various sources of information referenced. A digital copy of each source document, including primary literature, is stored. If the content license prohibits storing a digital copy, a print copy is stored. Quality data on actual case review by AIM's physician reviewers using the guidelines under consideration shall also be made available during the guideline review process.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development and Review Process</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Review Process</strong></p>
<p>When a new Guideline(s) is considered, the Chair of the Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) may choose to form a Specialty Panel to assist with the drafting and review of the Guideline. Similarly, the assigned AIM Medical Director may use a Specialty Panel to review and comment on proposed revisions to existing Guidelines.</p>
<p>In order for a new or revised Guideline to be approved for use by AIM, it must be reviewed by the Internal Panel of AIM physician reviewers. The Internal Panel considers supporting evidence as well as usability and validity within the education and adjudication process. The Internal Panel votes to forward recommendations to the Independent Physician Panel.</p>
<p>The Independent Physician Panel considers supporting evidence and the potential impact of draft AIM Guidelines on clinical outcomes and practice. The external panel votes to forward recommendations onto the CGC.</p>
<p>An AIM Medical Director is assigned to each program or solution for purposes of the guideline development and review process. These AIM Medical Directors are responsible for drafting new Guidelines as necessary and ensuring that every Guideline and the procedures for applying it, is reviewed and assessed for continued validity at least once annually. The assigned AIM Medical Directors are responsible for monitoring the clinical and regulatory environment with the support of AIM medical librarians to determine when Guideline revisions are necessary, based on new, potentially-relevant evidence and other factors. The assigned AIM Medical Directors are responsible for supporting the Vice President, Clinical Operations in facilitating education and training for the staff regarding the Guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Committee and Panel Operational Process</strong></p>
<p>Review requires that the Guideline and any supporting materials be provided to members who are given sufficient time for review. The body then meets (either in person or telephonically) to discuss the proposed changes or enhancements. Approval of a Guideline is demonstrated by a vote of at least a majority of the members of that body who are present at the meeting (but in no event fewer than three [3] affirmative votes). If approval is received, then the Guideline can proceed to the next stage of the process. If committee approval is not received at any stage of the process, then the assigned AIM Medical Director shall be responsible for addressing committee member concerns and resubmitting the Guideline for committee review.</p>
<p>Minutes of all meetings are maintained as well as documentation of all proposed, approved and tabled Guidelines and changes to Guidelines. All input received during any level of review is recorded and noted in any subsequent review. Input received after approval of a Guideline is presented at the next regularly scheduled CGC meeting.</p>
<p>The AIM Quality Improvement Committee (QIC) reviews and accepts the Guidelines.</p>
<p>Ultimate responsibility and accountability for the development, review and updating of AIM's Guidelines are delegated to the CGC. No new or revised Guideline can be implemented without CGC approval.</p></div>
