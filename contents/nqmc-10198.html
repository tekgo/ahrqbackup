<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a new diagnosis or recurrent episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) with three follow-up visits in the first 90 days following diagnosis of a new or recurrent episode of MDD.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The ongoing assessment of a patient's response to depression treatment is necessary to track changes in symptomology, side-effects due to treatment, adherence to treatment and functional status. The ongoing assessment also allows for the development and refinement of a treatment plan. The conclusion of the acute phase of treatment is remission, which ideally occurs within the first 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. The primary goal of the second phase, the continuation phase, is to sustain remission and prevent relapse (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009). Recurrence of depression after a first episode is common (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009). Clinicians should educate patients and their families to self-assess for symptoms and risk for recurrent episodes. Surveillance for recurrence or relapse should continue indefinitely (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009).</p>
<p>Of those diagnosed with depression, McGlynn and colleagues (2003) found that only 26% have medication treatment visits or telephone contacts at least once in the 2 weeks following initial diagnosis. Furthermore, during the first year of treatment, only 54% of patients have the degree of response/remission and side effects of medication assessed and documented at each visit during which depression is discussed (McGlynn et al., 2003). Hepner and colleagues (2007) found that of those with depression, only 59% of vulnerable patients receive adequate monitoring by primary care physicians during the continuation phase of treatment, and only 38% of nonresponsive patients receive a treatment adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines. Only selected portions of the clinical guidelines are quoted here; for more details, please refer to the full guideline</strong>. </p>
<p>The patient's response to treatment should be carefully monitored (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2010). </p>
<p>Generally, 4 to 8 weeks of treatment are needed before concluding that a patient is partially responsive or unresponsive to a specific intervention (APA, 2010). </p>
<p>During the acute phase of treatment, patients should be carefully and systematically monitored on a regular basis to assess their response to pharmacotherapy, identify the emergence of side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms, sedation, insomnia, activation, changes in weight, and cardiovascular, neurological, anticholinergic, or sexual side effects), and assess patient safety (APA, 2010).</p>
<p>During the continuation phase of treatment, the patient should be carefully monitored for signs of possible relapse (APA, 2010).</p>
<p>After initiation of therapy or change in medication or dose adjustment, patients should be monitored in person or by phone on a monthly basis. Clinicians can use these encounters to assess adherence to medication and psychotherapy, emergence of adverse effects, symptom breakthrough, suicidality, and psychosocial stress (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009). </p>
<p>The goal of treatment should be to achieve remission. Remission is defined as the absence of depressive symptoms or the presence of minimal depressive symptoms. Response is defined as a 50 percent or greater reduction in symptoms (as measured on a standardized rating scale) and partial response is typically defined as a 25 to 50 percent reduction in symptoms. For some standardized questionnaires (e.g., Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), specific changes in scores have been defined for the minimum clinically important improvement. Patients who have not shown at least a partial response by 4 to 6 weeks are unlikely to respond to that treatment. Therefore, a reasonable criterion for extending the initial treatment is if the patient is tolerating the treatment and experiencing clinically significant improvement at 4 weeks of therapeutic dose. For psychological treatments, response may be delayed, so the decision point for continued treatment may be delayed to 6 to 8 weeks (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009). </p>
<p>A large body of literature studying the effectiveness of either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy or both, typically report at least a partial remission (50 percent symptom reduction) within four to six weeks of treatment. Full response, defined as minimal or no symptoms, often requires a longer duration of treatment and full restoration of psychosocial functioning may take several months. Patients may discontinue treatment at the four to six week interval if either the symptoms are not improving or the symptoms have remitted somewhat despite the natural course of the illness. The four to six week patient visit is an important time to reinforce the need for continued treatment, possible treatment modification, patient education and assessment of adherence (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Prevalence and Incidence</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depressive disorder affects approximately 14.8 million American adults, or about 6.7 percent of the U.S. population aged 18 and older in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2010). </li>
    <li>While major depressive disorder can develop at any age, the median age at onset is 32 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>Major depressive disorder is more prevalent in women than in men (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>Depressive disorders are more common among persons with chronic conditions (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and cancer) and among those with unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity, and binge drinking) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disability</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for ages 15 to 44 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suicide</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Research has shown that more than 90% of people who kill themselves have depression or another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder (Conwell &amp; Brent, 1995). </li>
    <li>Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the 30,000 reported suicides in the U.S. each year (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). </li>
    <li>The suicide rate for older adults is more than 50% higher than the rate for the nation as a whole. Up to two-thirds of older adult suicides are attributed to untreated or misdiagnosed depression (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disparities</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic persons of other races are more likely to report major depression than non-Hispanic whites, based on responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8), which covers eight of the nine criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) for diagnosis of major depressive disorder (CDC, 2010). </li>
    <li>For individuals who experienced a depressive disorder in the past year, 63.7% of Latinos, 68.7% of Asians, and 58.8% of African Americans, compared with 40.2% of non-Latino whites, did not access any mental health treatment in the past year (Alegr&iacute;a et al., 2008). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Populations: Geriatrics</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The rate of depression in adults older than 65 years of age ranges from 7% to 36% in medical outpatient clinics and increases to 40% in the hospitalized elderly (Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [ICSI], 2010). </li>
    <li>Comorbidities are more common in the elderly. The highest rates of depression are found in those with strokes (30% to 60%), coronary artery disease (up to 44%), cancer (up to 40%), Parkinson's disease (40%), and Alzheimer's disease (20% to 40%) (ICSI, 2010). </li>
    <li>Similar to other groups, the elderly with depression are more likely than younger patients to underreport depressive symptoms (ICSI, 2010). </li>
