<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Should patients with recurrent or residual nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs) undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), fractionated radiation therapy (e.g., fractionated radiotherapy [XRT], fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy [SRT], or intensity modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]), or repeat resection?</p>
<p><strong>Target Population</strong></p>
<p>These recommendations apply to adult patients with recurrent or residual NFPAs.</p>
<p><strong>Level II Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Radiosurgery and radiation therapy are recommended for treatment of residual or recurrent NFPAs to lower the risk of subsequent tumor progression. </li>
    <li>When no residual tumor is present or only a small intrasellar tumor exists postoperatively, serial neuroimaging studies are recommended. </li>
    <li>Radiosurgery using single-session doses of 12 or more Gy or radiation therapy with fractionated doses of 45 to 54 Gy is recommended for greater local tumor control rate of 90% or higher at 5 years after treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Assessment of NFPA proliferative index and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) staining to identify silent corticotrophic adenomas are recommended for providing guidance regarding the risk of adenoma progression and the benefit of earlier adjuvant radiation. </li>
    <li>Repeat resection is recommended for the treatment of symptomatic recurrent or residual NFPAs. </li>
    <li>Radiosurgery or radiation therapy for NFPAs is recommended when residual/recurrent sellar or parasellar tumor exists and the risk of a repeat resection is high. </li>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The guideline task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published from January 1, 1966, to October 1, 2014. Searches were conducted in two electronic databases, PubMed and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the guideline task force members and medical/research librarians using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies. The root search strategies are provided in Appendix A of the introduction and methodology companion and the chapter-specific search strategies are provided in the appendix of the full version of the guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The searches of electronic databases were supplemented with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations were also screened. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed below. The guideline task force also examines lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions.</p>
<p><strong>Article Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were retrieved and included only if they met specific inclusion criteria. These criteria were also applied to articles provided by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline task force members who supplemented the electronic database searches with manual searches of the bibliographies. To reduce bias, these criteria were specified <em>a priori</em> before conducting the literature searches. For the purposes of this guideline, articles had to meet the following criteria to be included as evidence to support the recommendations presented in this guideline:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having a pituitary mass </li>
    <li>Enrolled patients &ge;18 years of age </li>
    <li>Either enrolled exclusively nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) patients OR combined the results of patients with NFPAs and functioning pituitary adenomas and/or other pituitary masses with &ge;90% of the patients having NFPAs </li>
    <li>Was a full article report of a clinical study </li>
    <li>If a prospective case series, reported baseline values </li>
    <li>Appeared in a peer-reviewed publication </li>
    <li>Enrolled &ge;10 NFPA patients per arm per intervention (20 total) for each outcome </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Was published in or after 1966 </li>
    <li>Quantitatively presented results </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Article Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles of the following types were excluded as evidence to support the recommendations presented in this guideline:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In vitro studies </li>
    <li>Studies performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Studies not published in English </li>
    <li>Medical records reviews, meeting abstracts, historical articles, editorial, letters, or commentaries </li>
    <li>Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or guidelines developed by others </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Methods for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published from January 1, 1966, to October 1, 2014. Authors searched 2 electronic databases, PubMed and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the medical librarian, using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies (see Appendix A in the full guideline). The Cochrane Library was searched for all NFPA articles. There were no specific Cochrane reviews for pituitary adenomas. Therefore, all appropriate references were found in the PubMed search.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The search resulted in 95 articles, and 46 were excluded based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned above according to the title and abstract.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical Analyses of Pooled Data</span></strong></p>
<p>To compare the tumor control rates between patients who underwent adjuvant radiation therapy and patients who were treated conservatively, the pooled data were analyzed using Review Manager version 5.2.8. The tumor control rates were extracted for the patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), and fractionated radiation therapy (XRT) as adjuvant treatment, and for patients who chose observation. Studies with tumor control rates of nonfunctioning adenoma (NFA) comparing adjuvant SRS and observation were included in the meta-analysis. Odds ratios for individual studies and the sum of the included studies were computed using the Mantel-Haenszel test.</p>
<p>Under the assumptions of possible clinical diversity among the included studies, the random effects model was implemented in the analyses for this review. Study heterogeneity was detected using the chi-square and I<sup>2</sup> test statistics. In general, a small number of studies in the analyses lower the power of the chi-square test. Therefore, both a chi-square value within the 10% (<em>P</em> &lt;.10) and an I<sup>2</sup> value exceeding 50% were required for significance.</p>
<p>The result of the meta-analysis is demonstrated in Figure 2 in the full version of the guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rating the Quality of the Evidence and Levels of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The quality and classification of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field) was rated using an evidence hierarchy developed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Guidelines Committee for each of four different study types: therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic, and economic or decision modeling. The methodology used to conduct quality evaluations of the evidence can be located on the <a href="https://www.cns.org/guidelines/guideline-procedures-policies/guideline-development-methodology" title="CNS Web site">CNS Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The level/strength of recommendation (i.e., Level I, II, or III) was linked to the quality of the overall body of evidence included in the chapter and in support of a given recommendation.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Process Overview</span></strong></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary task force comprised of physician volunteers and evidence-based medicine trained methodologists conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the management of non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). The physician volunteers represented neurosurgeons, neuro-ophthalmologists, neuroradiologists, and endocrinologists with expertise in pituitary adenomas. The evidence-based medicine trained methodologists had previous experience in guidelines production for the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). During the development process, the task force participated in a series of conference calls and meetings. Multiple iterations of written review were conducted by the individuals of the panel and various CNS/AANS Committees prior to approval.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Task Force Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline task force panel included context experts from multiple disciplines and various areas of therapy to address the topics addressed in this guideline. Sub-task force members were assigned to a specific chapter and were involved in the literature review, the creation and editing of the evidence tables, reviewing and voting of the final recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Voting on the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force used a structured voting technique to finalize and approve the final recommendations, language, and strength of recommendations, presented in this review. The voting technique is referred to as the nominal group technique. This technique includes up to three rounds of voting, using secret ballots to ensure task force members are blinded to the responses of other task force members. All the recommendations in this review were approved following the first round of voting and no further discussion was needed to finalize the recommendations. During the course of editing and finalization of the document, changes were made to allow recommendations to conform to the rules of evidence and language as described above. When this occurred, the changes were reviewed and approved by the group.</p></div>

<p>The guideline draft was circulated to the entire task force for final review and approval prior to submission for peer review by the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). Due to the reviewers' knowledge of evidence-based medicine and clinical practice guidelines methodology training, the JGC peer reviewers served as the journal's editorial reviewers. As a part of the JGC review process, the reviewers provided input on the content of the guideline and suggested revisions prior to approval and endorsement of the draft guideline by the CNS and AANS prior to publication. The development of this guideline was editorially independent from the funding agencies (CNS Executive Committee, and AANS/CNS Joint Tumor Section Executive Committee), the CNS and Joint Tumor Section.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For patients with residual or recurrent NFPA, long-term tumor control can be achieved with radiation. For those with a known residual adenoma, radiographic signs of progression make for a more compelling reason to intercede and retreat the adenoma. Radiographic signs of progression in the setting of younger patients or patients with symptoms attributable to progression should be considered even more strongly for intervention.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Repeat Resection</strong>: Although there is no direct comparison, second transsphenoidal approaches appear to convey higher complication rates, varying from 1% to 22%. The complications include hypopituitarism (&lt;5%), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage (1.5%-2.5%), postoperative hyponatremia (3.7%), transient or permanent diabetes insipidus (&lt;5%), visual deterioration (&lt;5%), meningitis (2.5%), hematoma on the tumor bed (1.7%), epistaxis, sinusitis, and anesthetic risks. Incomplete resection or failure to identify the remaining adenoma secondary to obscured anatomy can also occur during repeat resection. </li>
    <li><strong>Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)</strong>: Hypopituitarism is the most frequently occurring unintended side effect of radiosurgery. Rates of hypopituitarism ranged from 0% to 39% in the identified series. The second most common side effect from radiosurgery is a cranial neuropathy. Optic nerve dysfunction varied from 0% to 12.8%. Other deficits involving cranial nerves III, IV, and VI varied from 0% to 13.7%. </li>
    <li><strong>Fractionated Radiation Therapy</strong>: Immediate side effects may include nausea and some fatigue. These symptoms are usually mild, but they may last 1 to 2 months after radiation treatment. Hair loss at the entry sites, decreased taste, and diminished olfaction can also occur. Similar to SRS, the most common side effect is radiation-induced hypopituitarism. Hypopituitarism in the studies that met inclusion criteria ranged from 0% to 88%. Using conventional dose and fractionation schemes, the rate of radiation-induced damage to the visual pathways is 1% to 5%. Rare instances of radiation-induced tumor formation (e.g., parasellar fibrosarcomas), cerebral ischemia from carotid stenosis, and neuropsychological or cognitive changes have also been described. Cerebrovascular complications following radiation therapy were noted to be 4.5% in one series. In another series of 120 patients previously noted, radiation-induced neoplasia occurred in 1.7% of patients. </li>

<p>All Nonfunctioning Pituitary Adenoma (NFPA) Guideline Task Force members were required to disclose all potential conflicts of interest (COIs) prior to beginning work on the guideline, using the COI disclosure form of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Guidelines Committee. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair reviewed the disclosures and either approved or disapproved the nomination and participation on the task force. The CNS Guidelines Committee and Guideline Task Force Chair may approve nominations of Task Force Members with possible conflicts and restrict the writing, reviewing and/or voting privileges of that person to topics that are unrelated to the possible COIs.</p>
