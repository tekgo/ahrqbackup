<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 1. Primary Prevention</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should explain proper ear hygiene to prevent cerumen impaction when patients have an accumulation of cerumen.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Communicating safe preventive measures to patients (National Quality Strategy domain: patient and family engagement) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on preponderance of survey studies and 1 prospective pilot study </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefit: Promote safe and effective self-care behaviors in ear hygiene; prevent self-inflicted harms, such as abrasions, cuts, and impaction; reduction in health care utilization </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Induced patient anxiety regarding an asymptomatic condition; time spent in counseling; potential for increased use of health care resources if self-cleaning with cotton-tipped applicators is abandoned </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Perception by the group that patients overmanipulate the ears (i.e., cotton swab use) and that there is benefit in educating patients about proper ear hygiene </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The term <em>proper ear hygiene</em> is used and is discussed in detail in the text. The term <em>accumulation</em> is used but not precisely defined, as it is up to the clinician to determine. This statement applies to patients with impacted cerumen and those who are at risk. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Small; patient can decline education </li>
    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Statement 2A. Diagnosis of Cerumen Impaction</strong></span></p>
<p>Clinicians should diagnose cerumen impaction when an accumulation of cerumen, as seen with otoscopy, 1) is associated with symptoms, 2) prevents needed assessment of the ear, or 3) both.</p>

    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B for diagnostic studies with minor limitations regarding impact of cerumen on hearing and visualizations and grade C with respect to signs and symptoms associated with cerumen impaction </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Identify individuals with cerumen impaction who require intervention, including those with otologic symptoms and those who require diagnostic assessment (raise awareness of the consequences of cerumen impaction&mdash;e.g., cerumen impaction prevents caloric stimulation during electronystagmography) </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Overdiagnosis of cerumen impaction based on symptoms as a criterion resulting in failure to identify another cause of the symptoms; no additional cost </li>
    <li>Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefits over harms </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Emphasis on clinical symptoms and signs for initial diagnosis; importance of avoiding unnecessary diagnostic tests; consensus on using the term <em>cerumen impaction</em> to imply cerumen that requires treatment </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: Symptoms are defined in the supporting text (see the original guideline document); prevention of needed assessments is defined by the clinician </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>

<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Avoidance of harm, efficient use of health care resources (National Quality Strategy domains: patient safety and efficient use of health care resources) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, control groups in randomized trials and observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: Medium </li>
    <li>Benefit: Avoid unnecessary treatment with potential adverse events and costs </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Potential progression to impaction </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harms </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The presence of cerumen is not in itself harmful, and it may not progress to impaction; in fact, it may resolve spontaneously. If it progresses, it can be managed at that time. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The word <em>routinely</em> was added to this statement to acknowledge that there may be circumstances where cerumen removal may be offered anyway, as in a patient with hearing aids. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Substantial role for shared decision making. The patient may still opt for removal of the cerumen. </li>
    <li>Exceptions: Medical reasons for exceptions to this statement include, but are not limited to, history of recurrent cerumen impaction </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation against </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 3C. Need for Intervention in Special Populations</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should identify patients with obstructing cerumen in the ear canal who may not be able to express symptoms (young children and cognitively impaired children and adults), and they should promptly evaluate the need for intervention.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span></em> based on cohort and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</p>
<p><strong>Action Statement Profile</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality improvement opportunity: Efficient use of health care resources and coordination of care (National Quality Strategy domains: care coordination and efficient use of health care resources) </li>
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, cohort and observational studies </li>
    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Improved hearing and functional health status; improved evaluation of external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, and middle ear </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Potential overtreatment of cerumen that is asymptomatic; evaluation and treatment costs; substantial administrative burden in settings with a high prevalence of cognitively impaired individuals, such as nursing homes and institutional facilities </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Importance of identifying and treating cerumen impaction in special populations </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The term <em>young children</em> does not specify age but rather indicates children who are unable or too immature to express symptoms or who fail to disclose real symptoms out of fear of treatment. Additionally, the term <em>promptly</em> does not specify a time frame but allows for clinical judgment regarding how expedient the evaluation should be. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None for the patient but moderate for patient advocates </li>
    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
    <li>Differences of opinion: None </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement 4. Intervention in Hearing Aid Users</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should perform otoscopy to detect the presence of cerumen in patients with hearing aids during a health care encounter.</p>

    <li>Level of confidence in the evidence: High </li>
    <li>Benefit: Prevent hearing aid dysfunction and associated repair costs </li>
    <li>Risks, harms, costs: Overtreatment of asymptomatic cerumen </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Cerumen can have a disproportionate effect on patients with hearing aids due to their underlying hearing loss and the impact of the cerumen on the hearing aids, even if there is not an actual impaction. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The term <em>health care encounter</em> is somewhat vague but is intended to indicate any time that a patient with a hearing aid is assessed by a health care worker. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Small </li>
    <li>Exceptions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A literature search was performed by an information specialist to identify systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published since the prior guideline cutoff (September 2007). The following databases were searched from October 2007 to April 2015: MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), AMED (OvidSP), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, PubMed, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The databases were searched for the topic of interest with use of controlled vocabulary words and synonymous free text words (cerumen, earwax, and impaction). The search strategies were adjusted for the syntax appropriate for each database/platform.</p>
<p>The initial English-language search identified 1 potential clinical practice guideline, 7 systematic reviews, 5 RCTs and 10 other studies. All searches were conducted on April 3, 2015. Clinical practice guidelines were included if they met quality criteria of (a) an explicit scope and purpose, (b) multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement, (c) systematic literature review, (d) explicit system for ranking evidence, and (e) explicit system for linking evidence to recommendations. Systematic reviews were emphasized and included if they met quality criteria of (a) clear objective and methodology, (b) explicit search strategy, and (c) valid data extraction methods. RCTs were included if they met quality criteria of (a) trials involved study randomization, (b) trials were described as double blind, or (c) trials denoted a clear description of withdrawals and dropouts of study participants. Additional evidence was identified, as needed, with targeted searches to support needs of the guideline development group in updating sections of the guideline text. Specifically, ear candling/coning was identified as an area of concern by the reviewers. The databases were also searched through use of controlled vocabulary words and synonymous free text words for the topic of interest (ear candling and ear coning) in this population. The search strategies were adjusted for the syntax appropriate for each database/platform. The search was not limited by date range or study design, but was limited to English language.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The guideline update was developed with an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm, as outlined in the "Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition: A Quality-Driven Approach for Translating Evidence into Action" (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The original cerumen impaction guideline was first sent to a panel of expert reviewers, who were asked (1) to assess the key action statements and decide if they should be revised, kept as stands, or removed on the basis of relevancy, omissions, or controversies that the guideline spurred and (2) to identify any new literature or treatments that might affect the guideline recommendations. The reviewers concluded that the original guideline action statements remained valid but should be updated with minor modifications. A suggestion was also made for a new key action statement on the role of alternative therapies in management.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) assembled a Guideline Update Group (GUG) representing the disciplines of otolaryngology&ndash;head and neck surgery, otology/neurotology, family medicine, audiology, advanced practice nursing, pediatrics, geriatrics, a resident physician (otolaryngology), and a consumer advocate. The GUG also included a staff liaison from the AAO-HNSF, but this individual was not a voting member of the GUG and served only in an editorial capacity in writing the guideline. Several group members had significant prior experience in developing clinical practice guidelines.</p>
<p>The GUG had several conference calls and one in-person meeting, during which comments from the expert panel review and the literature search were reviewed for each key action statement. The GUG then decided to leave the statements unaltered, change slightly, or rewrite per the impact of the literature search, the reviewer comments, and the benefit-harm balance. The supporting text was then edited to explain any changes from the original key action statement, and the recommendation level was modified accordingly.</p>
<p>The evidence profile for each statement was then converted into an action statement profile, which was moved to immediately follow the action statement. Statements about the quality improvement opportunity, level of confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, intentional vagueness, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply were added to the action statement profiles. These additions reflect the current methodology for guideline development by the AAO-HNSF and conform to the Institute of Medicine's standards for developing trustworthy guidelines. The updated guideline then underwent GuideLine Implementability Appraisal to appraise adherence to methodologic standards, improve clarity of recommendations, and predict potential obstacles to implementation. The GUG received summary appraisals in October 2015 and modified an advanced draft of the guideline on the basis of the appraisal.</p></div>

    <li>Contraindicated intervention (ear candling/coning): Clinicians should recommend against ear candling/coning for treating or preventing cerumen impaction. </li>
    <li>If the ear canal is currently infected, irrigation should be avoided. Ear irrigation should not be performed in individuals who have a nonintact tympanic membrane or those who have had ear surgery, since the tympanic membrane may be thinned or atrophic and vulnerable to perforation. </li>
    <li>Jet irrigators should be avoided for home use due to risk of damage to ear structures. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the "Exceptions" statements in the "Action Statement Profiles" for additional guidance on medical reasons to avoid certain interventions or procedures.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing cerumen impaction. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions, but they are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible physician, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, Inc emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results.</li>
    <li>Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less-frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than what might be expected with a recommendation. Options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic.</li>
    <li>Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline update group (GUG) sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy. A major goal of the GUG was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process.</li>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The complete guideline is published as a supplement to <em>Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em> to facilitate reference and distribution. A full-text version of the guideline will also be accessible free of charge at the <a href="http://www.entnet.org/" title="AAO-HNSF Web site">American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) Web site</a>. Existing brochures and publications by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline recommendations.</p>
<p>An anticipated barrier to diagnosis is distinguishing modifying factors for cerumen impaction in a busy clinical setting. This will be addressed with a laminated teaching card or visual aid summarizing important factors that modify management. Laminated cards will be available for purchase through Guideline Central.</p>
<p>An anticipated barrier to the "observation option" for nonimpacted cerumen is patient and clinician reluctance to not intervene when cerumen is observed. This barrier can be overcome with educational pamphlets and information sheets that outline the favorable natural history of nonimpacted cerumen, the moderate incremental benefit of removal on clinical outcomes, the potential adverse effects of treatment, and the benefits of cerumen for a healthy ear canal.</p>
<p>Prompt evaluation of special populations may be hindered by the high prevalence of cerumen impaction in these populations and additional treatment time that may be necessary in busy practice settings. Information sheets outlining the high prevalence and the potential morbidity of cerumen impaction in these populations may increase awareness and willingness to manage this problem.</p>
<p>Performance of irrigation and instrument removal other than irrigation, when appropriate, may be hindered by access to equipment and by procedural cost. Lastly, successfully achieving an understanding of the lack of efficacy and potential harms of ear candling, a popular alternative therapy, will require patient and clinician access to educational materials. Pamphlets may help in dispelling myths about comparative efficacy.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Financial Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call and were updated at each subsequent call and in-person meeting. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed to not discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established "stake" in an issue.</p>
