<p>Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A recommendations.</strong> Generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level B recommendations.</strong> Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level C recommendations.</strong> Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances in which consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least 2 subcommittee members and assigned a Class of Evidence. In doing so, subcommittee members assigned design classes to each article, with design 1 representing the strongest study design and subsequent design classes (e.g., design 2, design 3) representing respectively weaker study designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic clinical reports, or meta-analyses (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, including but not necessarily limited to randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, sample size, and generalizability. Using predetermined formulas related to the study's design, methodological quality, and applicability to the critical question, articles received a final Class of Evidence grade (i.e., Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X) (see Appendix B in the original guideline document). Articles identified with fatal flaws or that were not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade "X" and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the specific critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different Classes of Evidence as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-specific Classes of Evidence grading may be found in the Evidentiary Table at the end of the original guideline document.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This policy is a product of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy development process, including expert review, and is based on the existing literature; where literature was not available, consensus of emergency physicians was used.</p></div>

<h3>
Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A recommendations.</strong> Generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level B recommendations.</strong> Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).</p>
<p><strong>Level C recommendations.</strong> Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances in which consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Expert review comments were received from emergency physicians, pediatric emergency physicians, toxicologists, a pediatric anesthesiologist, a pharmacist, and individual members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Medical Toxicology, American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP) Emergency Medicine Practice Committee, Medical-Legal Committee, and Pediatric Emergency Medicine Committee, ACEP's Toxicology Section, and ACEP's Emergency Medicine Workforce Section. The draft was also open to comments from ACEP membership through <em>EM Today</em>. Their responses were used to further refine and enhance this policy; however, their responses do not imply endorsement of this clinical policy.</p>
<p>This clinical policy was approved by the ACEP Board of Directors, October 11, 2013.</p>
<p>This guideline was endorsed by the Emergency Nurses Association, December 6, 2013.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate management of patients requiring procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department (ED) </li>
    <li>Appropriate monitoring of patients requiring procedural sedation and analgesia in the ED </li>
    <li>Avoidance of unnecessary delays for fasting prior to performance of procedural sedation in the ED, thus enabling more rapid patient management </li>
    <li>Appropriate and safe administration of moderate and deep sedatives used in procedural sedation in the ED </li>
    <li>Agents propofol and ketamine have been combined in studies in an effort to maximize benefits and limit unwanted side effects. Propofol-associated hypotension and respiratory depression can theoretically be reduced with increases in circulatory norepinephrine induced by ketamine. Similarly, the relatively greater risks for ketamine associated nausea and emergence reactions are theoretically reduced by the antiemetic and anxiolytic properties of propofol. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Detectable respiratory events such as hypoxia, respiratory depression, and/or apnea are common and can be precursors of more serious events during procedural sedation and analgesia. </li>
    <li>One disadvantage of etomidate use during procedural sedation is etomidate-associated myoclonus. </li>
    <li>Intravenous ketamine use in the adult population remains less common than in children, likely because of reported rates of emergence phenomena, including recovery agitation. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Qualifying Statements

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of <em>Annals of Emergency Medicine</em> and its editors. </li>
    <li>This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. </li>
    <li>It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain adequate empirical data to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. </li>
    <li>Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic and management options available to the emergency physician. ACEP clearly recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment and patient preferences. Rather, this guideline defines for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the crucial questions addressed in this policy. </li>
</ul>
