<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) be performed in patients with suspected ampullary adenocarcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma if the EUS findings or positive fine needle aspiration (FNA) results would change management (+++O). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) to assess for resectability if a computed tomography (CT) scan suggests cholangiocarcinoma, particularly of the bifurcation. If the lesion is unresectable, endoscopic palliation of jaundice should be performed by using MRC as a guide for unilateral drainage to minimize the risk of cholangitis (++++). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to obtain tissue or facilitate further evaluation of indeterminate strictures (+++O). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends that symptomatic patients with gallbladder polyp (GBP) undergo cholecystectomy (+++O). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee suggests that asymptomatic patients with a GBP larger than 10 mm undergo cholecystectomy (++OO). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee suggests that asymptomatic patients with a GBP 6 mm to 10 mm in size and without other risk factors for gallbladder cancer be followed by transabdominal ultrasound (TUS) every 12 months (++OO). </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends that the presence of any GBP should prompt cholecystectomy in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (+++O). </li>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Risk of post-procedural cholangitis or pancreatitis </li>
    <li>Complications related to procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). If the level of obstruction is at or above the hilum, extensive injection of contrast in ERCP should be avoided to minimize the risk of postprocedural cholangitis because the entire biliary tree may not drain adequately. Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) can be helpful in defining ductal anatomy before ERCP to reduce the risk of this adverse event. </li>

Qualifying Statements

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of this guideline. This guideline may be revised as necessary to account for changes in technology, new data, or other aspects of clinical practice. </li>
    <li>This guideline is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. This guideline is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment. Clinical decisions in any particular case involve a complex analysis of the patient's condition and available courses of action. Therefore, clinical considerations may lead an endoscopist to take a course of action that varies from these guidelines. </li>
