<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This indicator is intended to flag cases of complications that arise due to technical difficulties in medical care, specifically those involving a pneumothorax.</p>
<p>Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a relatively frequent and potentially serious complication of procedures adjacent to the lung or pleural space. For example, 1.9% of critical care patients developed iatrogenic pneumothorax within 2 days after central venous catheter (CVC) insertion at 2 tertiary care hospitals (Ayas et al., 2007). In another study from an academic center, 0.38% of feeding tube placements resulted in pneumothorax (Marderstein, Simmons, &amp; Ochoa, 2004). A nationwide study of administrative data from 994 acute care hospitals across 28 states (Zhan, Smith, &amp; Stryer, 2006) revealed that the rate of iatrogenic pneumothorax was 0.67 per 1000 hospitalized patients at risk, and procedure-specific rates varied from 2.68% for patients who underwent thoracentesis to 0.06% for those who underwent gastrostomy.</p>
<p>This measure focuses on a potentially preventable postprocedural complication, or adverse outcome.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The incidence of Pediatric Quality Indicator (PDI) 05 has decreased somewhat over time, despite virtually no change in the underlying specification of the indicator: 0.28 per 1,000 eligible discharges in 1997, 0.19 in 2000, 0.21 in 2003, 0.18 in 2006, and 0.16 (preliminary) in 2008. Similarly, Friedman et al. (2011) used data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project from 2000 to 2007 to examine trends in pediatric care. The overall rate of iatrogenic pneumothorax decreased 17.8% from 2000 to 2007, with a notable decrease in regional disparities (i.e., from 0.13 per 1,000 eligible discharges in the South and 0.30 in the Northeast in 2000 to 0.15 and 0.18, respectively, in 2007). However, the authors cautioned that present on admission data were not used and the sample of hospitals varied over the years. In any case, the recent decrease is thought to be a "success story" related to improved patient safety practices.</p>
<p>In a case control study using nearest-neighbor propensity score matching, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) pediatric-specific Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) were used to identify adverse events in 431,524 discharges from 38 freestanding, academic, not-for-profit pediatric hospitals affiliated with the Child Health Corporation of American and participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database in 2006 (Kronman et al., 2008). They reported a PDI 05 rate of 0.37 per 1,000 discharges, which is similar to the AHRQ reported rate of 0.44 per 1,000 discharges from children's hospitals for the same year. Records with a pressure ulcer (PU) event had mean excess length of stay of 3.39 days and mean excess hospital charges of $53,604, relative to matched controls. The excess charges came from all hospital cost centers, including pharmacy ($4,957), supplies ($889), laboratory ($3,958), imaging ($795), and other clinical activities ($5,562). </p>
<p>Several recent studies have focused on the potential to prevent these events. A meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials (Hind et al., 2003) with 579 participants showed that the risk of any procedural complication, including pneumothorax, is reduced when internal jugular (IJ) venous catheters are inserted with real-time ultrasound guidance (relative risk [RR] = 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.22 to 0.87). A subsequent randomized trial that involved 450 critically ill adults who underwent real-time ultrasound-guided cannulation of the IJ vein and 450 comparison patients for whom the landmark technique was used confirmed that ultrasound reduces the risk of pneumothorax (i.e., from 2.4% to 0%, P less than .001) and other complications (Karakitsos et al., 2006). Three randomized trials involving 167 infants (Calvert et al., 2003) also demonstrated that real-time ultrasound guidance reduces the risk of procedural complications during IJ cannulation (RR = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.91). For subclavian vein cannulation, the evidence that ultrasound guidance reduces the risk of procedural complications is less convincing because it comes from just 1 trial (RR = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.01-0.71) (Gualtieri et al., 1995).</p>
<p>The exact proportion of PDI 05 events that is preventable, with optimal procedural technique, is unknown. However, in one series of 148 confirmed cases from 28 participating hospitals in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions (Scanlon et al., 2008), 43 (29%) were deemed preventable, 53 (36%) were deemed nonpreventable, and 52 (35%) were characterized as having uncertain preventability. This determination was made independently by clinicians at each site, who lacked formal training but were guided by teleconference discussions. The authors concluded that the average children's hospital in the US reports 0.7 to 1.5 preventable PDI 05 events each year. In a previous review of 108 cases from 14 children's hospitals (Scanlon et al., 2006), using similar methods, 42% were deemed preventable, 39% were deemed unpreventable, and 19% were classified as "unable to determine"</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Includes approximately 6 million pediatric discharges for 2,500 hospitals ("Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [HCUP] State Inpatient Databases [SID]," 2008). </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. The signal to noise ratio is the ratio of the between hospital variance (signal) to the within hospital variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). The ratio itself is only a diagnostic for the degree of variance in the risk-adjusted rate systematically associated with the provider. Therefore, what matters is the magnitude of the variance in the "smoothed" rate (that is, the variance in the risk-adjusted rate after the application of the univariate shrinkage estimator based on the signal ratio). </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. What the data demonstrate is systematic variation in the provider level rate of 0.128 to 0.841 per 1,000 from the 5th to 95th percentile after a signal ratio of 0.463 is applied as the shrinkage estimator (that is, after accounting for variation due to random factors). </p>
<p>California data from 2005 to 2007, which included "present on admission" reporting, were used to determine the percentage of hospitals with patient volumes sufficient to readily use the Quality Indicator (QI) for tracking performance over time. Zero of 401 California hospitals (0.0%) had sufficient patient volume to detect a hypothetical doubling of the Pediatric Quality Indicator (PDI) 05 rate. This problem could be minimized by focusing public reporting of this indicator on hospitals that meet a minimum pediatric volume threshold, or by incorporating it into a more robust composite measure (Bardach, Chien, &amp; Dudley, 2010).</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. The most recent study of the criterion validity of PDI 05 was based on a consecutive sample of 184 flagged cases from 28 participating hospitals in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions (NACHRI) from 2003 through 2005 (Scanlon et al., 2008). Records were reviewed independently by clinicians at each site, who lacked formal training but were guided by teleconference discussions. A previous review of 108 flagged cases from 14 self-selected children's hospitals in the NACHRI Pediatric Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) Collaborative (Scanlon et al., 2006) used similar methods.</p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Calculation of the positive predictive value, which is defined as the percentage of reported events that are confirmed as true events based upon application of a "criterion (gold) standard." Sensitivity is defined as the percentage of all eligible events (based upon the same criterion standard) that are reported by hospitals in the administrative data set used for validation. In the cited studies, the criterion standard was based on review of randomly or chronologically sampled medical records by an experienced clinician, using a standard data collection tool and guidelines.</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. The larger, more recent study published in 2008 estimated a positive predictive value (PPV) of 80% (148/184), which is very consistent with the PPV estimates for the adult version of this indicator (e.g., 73% [95% confidence interval (CI), 64% to 81%] and 78% [95% CI, 73% to 82%] for PSI 06). Fewer details are reported from the earlier (2006) study, but Table 1 in that paper suggests a PPV of at least 61%.</p>
<p>False positive rates were low, as reported for PSI 15. Some false positives were due to complications that were actually present on admission (i.e., 19 of 36 false positives in the NACHRI study), which would automatically be excluded by users with "present on admission" (POA) data. (Current AHRQ PSI specifications assume that this data element is available.) Adjusting for the availability of POA data, the estimated PPV in the 2008 NACHRI study was 90%. The remaining false positives were mostly due to expected pneumothoraces in the course of procedures that did not trigger denominator exclusion or residual pneumothoraces after removal of a thoracostomy tube that had been placed for other reasons (e.g., elective surgery). </p>
<p>Face validity was systematically assessed using an expert panel process, as described in our original submission documents (McDonald et al., 2006). The methodology for the structured review was adapted from the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and consisted of an initial independent assessment of each indicator by clinician panelists using an initial questionnaire, a conference call among all panelists, followed by a final independent assessment by clinician panelists using the same questionnaire. Specifically, this indicator was reviewed by a pediatric specialty panel with eleven pediatric clinicians, including one general pediatrician, one hospitalist, one critical care physician, one neonatologist, one infectious disease specialist, one hematologist oncologist, one cardiothoracic surgeon, one emergency medicine specialist, one interventional radiologist, and two surgeons. The panel unanimously recommended splitting the original indicator into two separate indicators: 1) iatrogenic pneumothorax (neonates), and 2) iatrogenic pneumothorax (non-neonates). The second indicator, which is presented here, examines all other pediatric patients, using an exclusion of both normal newborns and neonates with a recorded birthweight of less than 2500 grams. The neonatal indicator has less evidence regarding preventability and has not been submitted for National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement. </p>

Description of Allowance for Patient or Population Factors
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The predicted value for each case is computed using a hierarchical model (logistic regression with hospital random effect) and covariates for gender, birthweight (500g groups), age in days (29 to 60, 61 to 90, 91+), age in years (in 5-year age groups), modified Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Classifications Software (CSS) comorbidities. The reference population used in the regression is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Data (SID) for the year 2008, a database consisting of 43 states and approximately 6 million pediatric discharges. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., hospital). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population rate.</p></div>
