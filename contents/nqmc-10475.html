<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) who had a suicide risk assessment completed during the visit in which a new diagnosis or recurrent episode was identified.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Research has shown that more than 90% of people who kill themselves have depression or another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder (Conwell &amp; Brent, 1995). Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the reported suicides in the U.S. each year (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). The intent of this measure is for a clinician to assess suicide risk at initial intake or at visit in which depression was diagnosed. As the guidelines state, it is important to assess for additional factors which may increase or decrease suicide risk, such as presence of additional symptoms (e.g., psychosis, severe anxiety, hopelessness, severe chronic pain); presence of substance abuse, history and seriousness of previous attempts, particularly, recent suicidal behavior, current stressors and potential protective factors (e.g., positive reasons for living, strong social support), family history of suicide or mental illness or recent exposure to suicide, impulsivity and potential for risk to others, including history of violence or violent or homicidal ideas, plans, or intentions, and putting one's affairs in order (e.g., giving away possessions, writing a will). In addition, although the measure focuses on the initial visit, it is critical that suicide risk be monitored especially for the 90 days following the initial visit and throughout major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment.</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines. Only selected portions of the clinical guidelines are quoted here; for more details, please refer to the full guideline</strong>.</p>
<p>A careful and ongoing evaluation of suicide risk is necessary for all patients with MDD. (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2010) </p>
<p>Such an assessment includes specific inquiry about suicidal thoughts, intent, plans, means, and behaviors; identification of specific psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychosis, severe anxiety, substance use) or general medical conditions that may increase the likelihood of acting on suicidal ideas; assessment of past and, particularly, recent suicidal behavior; delineation of current stressors and potential protective factors (e.g., positive reasons for living, strong social support); and identification of any family history of suicide or mental illness. (APA, 2010)</p>
<p>As part of the assessment process, impulsivity and potential for risk to others should also be evaluated, including any history of violence or violent or homicidal ideas, plans, or intentions. (APA, 2010) </p>
<p>The patient's risk of harm to him- or herself and to others should also be monitored as treatment proceeds. (APA, 2010)</p>
<p>Guidelines for Selecting a Treatment Setting for Patients at Risk for Suicide or Suicidal Behaviors (APA, 2003):</p>
<p><em>Admission Generally Indicated</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After a suicide attempt or aborted suicide attempt if:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patient is psychotic </li>
    <li>Attempt was violent, near-lethal, or premeditated </li>
    <li>Precautions were taken to avoid rescue or discovery </li>
    <li>Persistent plan and/or intent is present </li>
    <li>Distress is increased or patient regrets surviving </li>
    <li>Patient is male, older than age 45 years, especially with new onset of psychiatric illness or suicidal thinking </li>
    <li>Patient has limited family and/or social support, including lack of stable living situation </li>
    <li>Current impulsive behavior, severe agitation, poor judgment, or refusal of help is evident </li>
    <li>Patient has change in mental status with a metabolic, toxic, infectious, or other etiology requiring further workup in a structured setting </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the presence of suicidal ideation with:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Specific plan with high lethality </li>
    <li>High suicidal intent </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Admission May Be Necessary</em></p>
<p>[In addition to the list above, these additional circumstances may warrant admission]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After a suicide attempt or aborted suicide attempt:</span> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the presence of suicidal ideation with:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major psychiatric disorder </li>
    <li>Past attempts, particularly if medically serious </li>
    <li>Possibly contributing medical condition (e.g., acute neurological disorder, cancer, infection) </li>
    <li>Lack of response to or inability to cooperate with partial hospital or outpatient treatment </li>
    <li>Need for supervised setting for medication trial or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) </li>
    <li>Need for skilled observation, clinical tests, or diagnostic assessments that require a structured setting </li>
    <li>Lack of an ongoing clinician-patient relationship or lack of access to timely outpatient follow-up </li>
    <li>[Evidence of putting one's affairs in order (e.g., giving away possessions, writing a will)] </li>
</ul>
<p>In the absence of suicide attempts or reported suicidal ideation/plan/intent but evidence from the psychiatric evaluation and/or history from others suggests a high level of suicide risk and a recent acute increase in risk.</p>
<p><em>Release from Emergency Department with Follow-up Recommendations May Be Possible</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After a suicide attempt or in the presence of suicidal ideation/plan when:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Suicidality is a reaction to precipitating events (e.g., exam failure, relationship difficulties), particularly if the patient's view of situation has changed since coming to emergency department </li>
    <li>Plan/method and intent have low lethality </li>
    <li>Patient has stable and supportive living situation </li>
    <li>Patient is able to cooperate with recommendations for follow-up, with treater contacted, if possible, if patient is currently in treatment </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Outpatient Treatment May Be More Beneficial Than Hospitalization</em></p>
<p>Patient has chronic suicidal ideation and/or self-injury without prior medically serious attempts, if a safe and supportive living situation is available and outpatient psychiatric care is ongoing.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong></p>
<p><em>Prevalence and Incidence</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects approximately 14.8 million American adults, or about 6.7% of the U.S. population aged 18 and older in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2010). </li>
    <li>While MDD can develop at any age, the median age at onset is 32 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>MDD is more prevalent in women than in men (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>Depressive disorders are more common among persons with chronic conditions (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and cancer) and among those with unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity, and binge drinking) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disability</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>MDD is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for ages 15 to 44 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Suicide</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Research has shown that more than 90% of people who kill themselves have depression or another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder (Conwell &amp; Brent, 1995). </li>
    <li>Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the 30,000 reported suicides in the U.S. each year (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010) </li>
    <li>The suicide rate for older adults is more than 50% higher than the rate for the nation as a whole. Up to two-thirds of older adult suicides are attributed to untreated or misdiagnosed depression (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Disparities</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic persons of other races are more likely to report major depression than non-Hispanic whites, based on responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8), which covers eight of the nine criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) for diagnosis of major depressive disorder (CDC, 2010). </li>
    <li>For individuals who experienced a depressive disorder in the past year, 63.7% of Latinos, 68.7% of Asians, and 58.8% of African Americans, compared with 40.2% of non-Latino whites, did not access any mental health treatment in the past year (Alegr&iacute;a et al., 2008). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Special Populations: Geriatrics</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The rate of depression in adults older than 65 years of age ranges from 7% to 36% in medical outpatient clinics and increases to 40% in the hospitalized elderly (Mitchell et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>Comorbidities are more common in the elderly. The highest rates of depression are found in those with strokes (30% to 60%), coronary artery disease (up to 44%), cancer (up to 40%), Parkinson's disease (40%), and Alzheimer's disease (20% to 40%)](Mitchell et al., 2013). </li>
    <li>Similar to other groups, the elderly with depression are more likely than younger patients to underreport depressive symptoms (Mitchell et al., 2013). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Hepner and colleagues (2007) found that primary care physicians (PCPs) assess for suicide only 24% of the time in patients with depression. In the same study, only 28% of PCPs adhered to the quality indicator "Treatment for suicidal ideation among patients not already followed in mental health care" (Hepner et al., 2007). McGlynn and colleagues (2003) found that only 25.8% of PCPs document the presence or absence of suicidal ideation during the first or second diagnostic visit. The same study showed that only 28.9% of patients who have suicidality and have any of the following risk factors: psychosis, current alcohol or drug abuse or dependency, and specific plans to carry out suicide (e.g., obtaining a weapon, putting affairs in order, making a suicide note) are hospitalized (McGlynn. et al., 2003). Additionally, Luoma and colleagues (2002) found that 40% of patients who completed suicide had seen their primary care physician in the past month.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a testing project in 2012 to ensure the <em>Adult Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Suicide Risk Assessment</em> measure is reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator and denominator case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing electronic health record data. Parallel forms reliability was tested. Three sites participated in the parallel forms testing of the measure. Site A was a regional extension center comprised of a network of community health centers with 4,065 providers. Site B was a physician-owned private practice in an urban setting. Site C was a non-profit community mental health center with 5 psychiatrists, 30 therapists and 4 nurse practitioners.</p>
<p><strong>Measures Tested</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Adult Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) - Suicide Risk Assessment </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from electronic health records were used to calculate parallel forms reliability for the measure.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing Results</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parallel Forms Reliability Testing (Site A, B and C)</span></p>
<p>There were 120 observations from three sites used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.80 demonstrates substantial agreement between the automated report and reviewer.</p>
<p>Of the 120 observations that were initially selected, 117 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.37 demonstrates fair agreement between the automated report and reviewer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval)</span></p>
<p>Denominator: 120, 99.17%, 0.80 (0.40, 1.00)<br />
Numerator: 117, 66.67%, 0.37 (0.20-0.53)*</p>
<p class="Note">*This is an example of the limitation of the Kappa statistic. While the agreement can be 90% or greater, if one classification category dominates, the Kappa can be significantly reduced (<a href="http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/184/5/1391" title="American Journal of Roentgenology Web site">http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/184/5/1391</a>).</p></div>
