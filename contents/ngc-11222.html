</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For patients with low-risk prostate cancer who require or choose active treatment, LDR alone, EBRT alone, or RP should be offered to eligible patients. </li>
    <li>For patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer choosing EBRT with or without androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), brachytherapy boost (LDR or high-dose rate [HDR]) should be offered to eligible patients. For low-intermediate risk prostate cancer (Gleason 7, prostate-specific antigen, 10 ng/mL or Gleason 6, prostate-specific antigen, 10 to 20 ng/mL) LDR brachytherapy alone may be offered as monotherapy. For patients with high-risk prostate cancer receiving EBRT and ADT, brachytherapy boost (LDR or HDR) should be offered to eligible patients. </li>
    <li><sup>125</sup>I and <sup>103</sup>PD are each reasonable isotope options for patients receiving LDR brachytherapy; no recommendation can be made for or against using <sup>131</sup>Cs or HDR monotherapy. </li>
    <li>Patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials to test novel or targeted approaches to this disease. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Update Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) uses a "signals" approach to facilitate guideline updating. This approach is intended to identify new, potentially practice-changing data&mdash;signals&mdash;that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on routine literature searching and the expertise of ASCO guideline panel members to identify signals. The Methodology Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provides additional information about the signals approach.</p>
<p>For this update, the signal was the presentation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing dose-escalated (DE)-external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy boost (LDR-B) that could potentially expand the patient population to whom the original recommendations would apply. The full Update Committee was then convened to review the evidence.</p>
<p>Evidence was also collected through a systematic review of the medical literature. Publications were included if they were phase III randomized clinical trials of brachytherapy compared with either external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or radical prostatectomy (RP) in men with prostate cancer. These publications were identified by rerunning the original strategy in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews, for the period from the original search in 2011 through to the end of August 2015. A final search for important papers was made in December 2016.</p>
<p>Further details on the search strategy and results are provided in Data Supplements 2 and 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by one American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewer in consultation with the Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by one staff reviewer and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study quality was formally assessed for the studies identified. Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer and included factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, etc. The risk of bias is assessed as "low," "intermediate," or "high" for most of the identified evidence.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) and Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Program in Evidence-based Care (PEBC) convened an Update Panel with multidisciplinary representation in radiation oncology, medical oncology, urology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Update Panel was led by two Co-Chairs (one from each organization) who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. For this guideline product, the Co-Chairs selected additional members to assist in the development and review of the guideline drafts.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Update Panel held teleconferences on several occasions and corresponded frequently through e-mail; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Update Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software.&trade; This method helps Guideline Expert Panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Expert Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recognizes that there is often a wide array of choices for treating many cancer types, with often a wide disparity in cost to patients and payers (despite much difference in effectiveness or toxicity). One study reported that of the radiation modalities used in the treatment of prostate cancer, from the Medicare payer perspective, low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy is the cheapest (compared with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy [SABR], external beam radiation therapy [EBRT], or protons). Another study showed that in the Canadian health care context, SABR had the higher quality-adjusted life-years and was more cost effective compared with LDR (and both were better than EBRT). Further work is needed to articulate cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility differences between the various prostate cancer treatment approaches.</p></div>
