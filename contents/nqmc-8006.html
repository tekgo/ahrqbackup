<h2>Brief Abstract
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and older initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who are not candidates for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment who receive aspirin within 24 hours of hospitalization, after a negative head computed tomography (CT), unless contraindicated.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and over receiving appropriate thrombolytic and appropriate antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] and aspirin, other antiplatelet agents, or an anticoagulant).</p>
<p>Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.</p>
<p>Although the benefits of aspirin therapy for long-term preventive therapy for stroke are well established, the use of aspirin to improve outcome in the acute treatment setting has also been demonstrated. Large randomized controlled trials have identified a small but measurable benefit with use of aspirin started within the first 48 hours following ischemic stroke onset.</p></div>
