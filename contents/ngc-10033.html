Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the quality of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low, and very low</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>strong and conditional</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) is most often established by the presence of 2 of the 3 following criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) serum amylase and/or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and/or (iii) characteristic findings from abdominal imaging (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48&ndash;72 hours after hospital admission or to evaluate complications (<strong>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Etiology</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Transabdominal ultrasound should be performed in all patients with AP (<strong>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In the absence of gallstones and/or history of significant history of alcohol use, a serum triglyceride should be obtained and considered the etiology if &gt;1,000 mg/dl (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In a patient &gt;40 years old, a pancreatic tumor should be considered as a possible cause of AP (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Endoscopic investigation of an elusive etiology in patients with AP should be limited, as the risks and benefits of investigation in these patients are unclear (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients with idiopathic AP (IAP) should be referred to centers of expertise (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Genetic testing may be considered in young patients (&lt;30 years old) if no cause is evident and a family history of pancreatic disease is present (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Initial Assessment and Risk Stratification</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation and resuscitative measures begun as needed (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Risk assessment should be performed to stratify patients into higher- and lower-risk categories to assist triage, such as admission to an intensive care setting (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low to moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients with organ failure should be admitted to an intensive care unit or intermediary care setting whenever possible (<strong>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Initial Management</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Aggressive hydration, defined as 250&ndash;500 ml per hour of isotonic crystalloid solution should be provided to all patients, unless cardiovascular, renal, or other related comorbid factors exist. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial during the first 12&ndash;24 hours, and may have little benefit beyond this time period (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In a patient with severe volume depletion, manifest as hypotension and tachycardia, more rapid repletion (bolus) may be needed (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Lactated Ringer's solution may be the preferred isotonic crystalloid replacement fluid (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Fluid requirements should be reassessed at frequent intervals within 6 hours of admission and for the next 24&ndash;48 hours. The goal of aggressive hydration should be to decrease the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in AP</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with AP and concurrent acute cholangitis should undergo ERCP within 24 hours of admission (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>ERCP is not needed early in most patients with gallstone pancreatitis who lack laboratory or clinical evidence of ongoing biliary obstruction (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In the absence of cholangitis and/or jaundice, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) rather than diagnostic ERCP should be used to screen for choledocholithiasis if highly suspected (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Pancreatic duct stents and/or postprocedure rectal non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories should be utilized to lower the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Role of Antibiotics in AP</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Antibiotics should be given for an extrapancreatic infection, such as cholangitis, catheter-acquired infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, pneumonia (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe AP is not recommended (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>The use of antibiotics in patients with sterile necrosis to prevent the development of infected necrosis is not recommended (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Infected necrosis should be considered in patients with pancreatic or extrapancreatic necrosis who deteriorate or fail to improve after 7&ndash;10 days of hospitalization. In these patients, either (i) initial computed tomography (CT)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for Gram stain and culture to guide use of appropriate antibiotics or (ii) empiric use of antibiotics after obtaining necessary cultures for infectious agents, without CT FNA, should be given (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis, such as carbapenems, quinolones, and metronidazole, may be useful in delaying or sometimes totally avoiding intervention, thus decreasing morbidity and mortality (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Routine administration of antifungal agents along with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics is not recommended (<strong>Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Nutrition in AP</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In mild AP, oral feedings can be started immediately if there is no nausea and vomiting, and the abdominal pain has resolved (<strong>Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In mild AP, initiation of feeding with a low-fat solid diet appears as safe as a clear liquid diet (<strong>Conditional recommendations, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In severe AP, enteral nutrition is recommended to prevent infectious complications. Parenteral nutrition should be avoided, unless the enteral route is not available, not tolerated, or not meeting caloric requirements (<strong>Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Nasogastric delivery and nasojejunal delivery of enteral feeding appear comparable in efficacy and safety (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Role of Surgery in AP</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In patients with mild AP, found to have gallstones in the gallbladder, a cholecystectomy should be performed before discharge to prevent a recurrence of AP (<strong>Moderate recommendation, moderate quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In a patient with necrotizing biliary AP, in order to prevent infection, cholecystectomy is to be deferred until active inflammation subsides and fluid collections resolve or stabilize (<strong>Strong recommendation, moderate evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>Asymptomatic pseudocysts and pancreatic and/or extrapancreatic necrosis do not warrant intervention regardless of size, location, and/or extension (<strong>Moderate recommendation, high quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In stable patients with infected necrosis, surgical, radiologic, and/or endoscopic drainage should be delayed preferably for more than 4 weeks to allow liquification of the contents&nbsp;and the development of a fibrous wall around the necrosis (walled-off necrosis) (<strong>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
    <li>In symptomatic patients with infected necrosis, minimally invasive methods of necrosectomy are preferred to open necrosectomy (<strong>Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low</strong>: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Very Low</strong>: Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>: The desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects or clearly do not.</p>
<p><strong>Conditional</strong>: The tradeoffs are less certain between the desirable and undesirable effects of an intervention.</p></div>
