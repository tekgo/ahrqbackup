Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with documentation in the medical record that a head-to-toe skin inspection and palpation were completed within six hours of admission. </p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve the frequency of skin inspections and re-inspections in hospitalized patients and outpatient care patients with identified pressure ulcer(s).</p>
<p>Pressure ulcers have been associated with an extended length of hospitalization, sepsis and mortality. In fact, nearly 60,000 United States hospital patients are estimated to die each year from complications due to hospital-acquired pressure ulcers. The estimated cost of managing a single full-thickness pressure ulcer is as high as $70,000, and the total cost for treatment of pressure ulcers in the United States is estimated at $11 billion per year. Furthermore, the prevalence of pressure ulcers in health care facilities is increasing. Pressure ulcer incidence rates vary considerably by clinical setting, ranging from 0.4% to 38% in acute care, from 2.2% to 23.9% in long-term care, and from 0% to 17% in home care.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as of October 1, 2008, announced a transformational change in hospital payments. This change involved the implementation of a new payment system that rewards hospitals for quality care and avoids payments for unnecessary and preventable costs. Therefore, by screening patients entering the hospital for pressure ulcers, the ulcers will be discovered upon admission and improve treatment of this frequently preventable condition.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It is estimated that pressure ulcer prevalence (the percentage of patients with pressure ulcers at any one point in time) in acute care is 15%, while incidence (the rate at which new cases occur in a population over a given time period) in acute care is 7%. </li>
    <li>The Minnesota Health Department's Adverse Health Events report from 2003 to 2010 showed 249 patients developed hospital-acquired stage III or IV unstageable pressure ulcers (reportable events). In reporting year 2010, 30% of stage III, IV and unstageable pressure ulcers reported under Minnesota's Adverse Health Care Event Reporting Law were classified as device-related pressure ulcers. The majority of the devices involved were cervical collars. </li>
    <li>Research has identified age as a risk factor for developing pressure ulcers in correlation with factors such as low blood pressure, temperature, and poor protein intake. Advancing age, along with other risk factors, increases the risk for pressure ulcer development. The existence of comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular and endocrine diseases may contribute to increased vulnerability for the development of pressure ulcers. </li>
</ul>
