Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult home health care patients who reported that their home health care team communicated well with them.</p>
<p>The "Communications Between Providers and Patients" composite measure is based on six questions in the Home Health Care CAHPS Survey. Two of the questions ask patients whether ("Yes" or "No"):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>When you first started getting home health care from this agency, did someone from the agency tell you what care and services you would get? </li>
    <li>In the last 2 months of care, when you contacted this agency's office did you get the help or advice you needed? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>Three of the questions ask patients how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always"):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In the last 2 months of care, how often did home health providers from this agency keep you informed about when they would arrive at your home? </li>
    <li>In the last 2 months of care, how often did home health providers from this agency explain things in a way that was easy to understand? </li>
    <li>In the last 2 months of care, how often did home health providers from this agency listen carefully to you? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AND</strong></p>
<p>One question asks patients how often ("Same day," "1 to 5 days," "6 to 14 days," "More than 14 days"):</p>
<ul>
    <li>When you contacted this agency's office, how long did it take for you to get the help or advice you needed? </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. The scoring on this composite will represent the proportion of respondents who answered "Yes," "Always," and "Same day" to these questions. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level reporting. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS&reg;) Home Health Care Survey (HHCAHPS) is designed to measure the experiences of people receiving home health care from Medicare-certified home health care agencies. </p>
<p>The survey is designed to meet the following three broad goals:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>To produce comparable data on the patient's perspective that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between home health agencies on domains that are important to consumers. </li>
    <li>Public reporting of survey results will create incentives for agencies to improve their quality of care. </li>
    <li>Public reporting will enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of care provided in return for public investment. </li>
</ul></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>On September 25, 2006, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a call in the Federal Register for survey items or measures representing areas of quality home health care that are viewed as important to consumers, their families, and intermediaries and initiated a review of existing literature in the area. AHRQ developed a draft survey instrument after several rounds of cognitive testing. A field test was conducted in 2008 with 34 home health agencies to test the psychometric properties of the survey and finalize its content. A final Home Health Care CAHPS Survey was developed in the summer of 2008.</p></div>

Only questions that are answered by survey respondents are included in the calculation of composite scores. The numerator for each question in the composite is the number of respondents in the quarter who gave the most positive response to each question (that is, responded "Yes" to two questions, "Always" to three questions, and "Same day" to one question). From the responses, a composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. </p>

Description of Allowance for Patient or Population Factors
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The patient mix adjustment factors being used in the Home Health Care CAHPS (HHCAHPS) Survey are derived from coefficients obtained from Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses on each separate HHCAHPS response item for the identified patient characteristics. The regression coefficients indicate the tendency of patients with particular characteristics to respond more positively or negatively to HHCAHPS Survey questions. Patient mix adjustment factors are calculated directly from these regression coefficients for each HHCAHPS response item by multiplying the coefficients by negative one (&minus;1.0).</p>
<p>Patient mix adjustment factors to account for home health agency (HHA) differences in patient mix are calculated for the latest quarter and applied to HHA raw scores for each of the latest quarter's HHCAHPS response items. The latest quarter's composite measures are then formed from these adjusted scores. The last four quarters of adjusted scores are then averaged to produce the current quarter's published scores. Published scores are adjusted for differences between an HHA's patient composition according to the HHCAHPS patient mix characteristics and the overall national composition of home health patients on these same characteristics. This adjustment, which allows consumers to compare different HHAs based on the same overall patient composition, is made by subtracting the national mean for a given patient characteristic from an HHA's share of patients on this patient characteristic.</p>
