<h2>Brief Abstract
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, aged 18 years and older, with a pre-existing drug-eluting coronary stent, who undergo a surgical or therapeutic procedure under anesthesia, who receive aspirin 24 hours prior to anesthesia start time.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Late stent thrombosis is a relatively rare but serious complication of stent placement, with an estimated case fatality rate of up to 45%. Multiple studies have shown that premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy is associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis in patients with drug-eluting stents. Late stent thrombosis, or thrombosis greater than 1 year after stent placement, is of particular concern for drug-eluting stents. This concern indicates a need for a longer course of dual antiplatelet therapy for patients with drug-eluting stents compared to those with bare metal stents. </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>:</p>
<p>The following evidence statements are quoted verbatim from the referenced clinical guidelines: American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommendation:</p>
<p>In patients who have received drug-eluting coronary stents and who must undergo urgent surgical procedures that mandate the discontinuation of thienopyridine therapy, it is reasonable to continue aspirin if at all possible and restart the thienopyridine as soon as possible (Grines et al., 2007).</p>
<p>For patients treated with drug-eluting stents (DES) who are to undergo subsequent procedures that mandate discontinuation of thienopyridine therapy, aspirin should be continued if at all possible and the thienopyridine restarted as soon as possible after the procedure because of concerns about late-stent thrombosis.</p></div>
