<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment Criteria for Removal of Third Molars: Erupted Third Molars</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>An erupted third molar is one so positioned that the entire clinical crown is visible.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Based upon a review of the current literature on the topic of third molar extractions, there is nearly unanimous agreement regarding treatment for fully erupted third molars. The following indications and contraindications reflect the current rationale for removal of erupted third molars. Final determinants for treatment, however, will always be the practitioner's clinical judgment and the patient's informed consent.</p>
<p><strong>Indications for Removal*</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Non-restorable, carious tooth. </li>

    <li>Non-treatable pulpal or periapical lesion. </li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment Criteria for Removal of Third Molars: Partially Erupted Third Molars</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>A partially erupted tooth is one so positioned that only a portion of the clinical crown is visible.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Based upon a review of the current literature, the following indications and contraindications reflect the current rationale for removal of partially erupted third molars. Final determinants for treatment will always be the practitioner's clinical judgment and the patient's informed consent.</p>
<p><strong>Indications for Removal*</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment Criteria for Removal of Third Molars: Unerupted Third Molars</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>An unerupted third molar is one that has not penetrated through the bone and/or soft tissue and entered the oral cavity by an age when such eruption is expected.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The indications for removal of unerupted third molars when associated with pathology have been clearly established. Absolute indications and contraindications for the removal of unerupted asymptomatic third molars cannot be established because no long term studies exist which validate the benefit to the patient either of early removal or deliberate retention of these teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Indications for Removal*</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Pathology associated with tooth follicle (e.g., cyst, tumor). </li>
    <li>To facilitate the management of periodontal disease. </li>
    <li>Resorption of adjacent tooth. </li>
    <li>To facilitate orthodontic treatment. </li>
    <li>Unerupted molar under a prosthetic appliance. </li>
    <li>Tooth in the line of a jaw fracture. </li>
    <li>Tooth involved in the resection of pathologic lesion. </li>
    <li>Tooth interfering with orthognathic or reconstructive surgery. </li>
    <li>Prophylactic tooth removal, when indicated, for patients with medical or surgical conditions or treatments (e.g., organ transplants, alloplastic implants, chemotherapy, radiation therapy). </li>
    <li>Internal or external resorption of tooth. </li>
    <li>Need for donor transplant. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Contraindications for Removal*</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patient refuses treatment. </li>
    <li>Compromised medical condition. </li>
    <li>Age of patient (see the flowchart in the original guideline document). </li>
    <li>Increased probability of damage to important adjacent structures. </li>
    <li>Bisphosphonate therapy (current or history of). </li>
    <li>Post head and neck radiation therapy. </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note">*Indications and contraindications are relative, not absolute.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suggestions to Clinicians</span></strong></p>
<p>In summary, the committee have the following suggestions for treatment, referral, and monitoring asymptomatic impacted third molars:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>If the patient is over 30 years of age, third molars should be monitored. Suggested monitoring regimen is an annual radiograph and clinical examination. </li>
    <li>If the patient is between 14 and 30 years of age and root formation is at least 1/2 to 2/3 complete, the examining dentist should review treatment options including risks and benefits. Referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for consultation can be made as indicated. </li>
    <li>If there are multiple third molars present, the treating general dentist or oral surgeon will consult on the advisability of removal of all third molars simultaneously. </li>
</ol>
<p>The decision to have asymptomatic teeth removed should be made by the well informed patient in consultation with their care provider.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Benefits of Extraction</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Relation to age: Studies have shown that increased numbers of complications occur with removal of impacted lower third molars in older patients. These complications include: increased pain, swelling, trismus, bleeding, fractured roots, lingual and inferior alveolar nerve injury, localized osteitis, and prolongs healing. Current literature indicates that the ideal age for impacted third molar removal with minimal complications is between the ages of 14 and 30. Based upon root formation, the ideal time for removal of impacted third molars is when root formation is between 1/3 and 2/3 complete. </li>
    <li>Relation to periodontal status: Patients with impacted mandibular third molars often have deep periodontal pockets on the distal aspect of the second molar. Early removal of the third molar can help prevent this bone loss, and increase likelihood of bony healing in the area previously occupied by the crown of the third molar. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Nonextraction</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Prosthetic potential: A retained third molar could serve as a transplant tooth in the event of adjacent tooth loss, or as a bridge abutment </li>
    <li>Avoid unnecessary procedure: Pathological changes related to long term impaction of third molars are not common; many people can live their entire life without any complication form an impacted third molar </li>
    <li>Less morbidity, less missed work: Many studies cite estimates of the amount of discomfort and decreased productivity following elective third molar extraction </li>
    <li>Reduced cost: Both patients and insurers save cost of surgery if it can be avoided without detriment to the patient </li>
</ul></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risks of Extraction</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Sensory nerve alterations: Incidence of sensory nerve (lingual or inferior alveolar) damage following third molar removal ranges from less than 1% to 6% </li>
    <li>Localized osteitis: Localized osteitis will occur in about 1% to 5% of patients regardless of the skill of the surgeon or the surgical protocol </li>
    <li>Additional risks include: Postoperative infection, trismus, hemorrhage, dentoalveolar fractures, displacement of tooth, sinus perforation, adjacent tooth fractures, damage to adjacent restorations, jaw fracture </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks of Nonextraction</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Resorption of second molar: Clinical and radiographic studies indicate a range of resorption of adjacent second molars from 3.5% to 4.7%.</li>
    <li>Development of cyst, tumor, or infection: studies have shown that 12% of unerupted teeth had associated pathology and that there was no increase in pathology with increased age of the patient. A cyst has been defined in the literature as a follicular space ranging from 2.0 mm to greater than 5.0 mm. </li>
    <li>Crowding of dentition: Removal of third molars to prevent or reduce anterior arch crowding is a controversial practice. Some authors state that removal of third molars provides no benefit with respect to crowding, while others found less crowding when third molars were removed. Since this variation exists, some orthodontists will request removal and some will not. </li>
    <li>Recurrent pericoronitis </li>
    <li>Periodontal disease </li>
    <li>Dental caries </li>
