<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 18 to 64 years of age with schizophrenia and cardiovascular disease who had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) test during the measurement year.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patients with schizophrenia are likely to have higher levels of blood cholesterol and are more likely to receive less treatment. Patients with schizophrenia and elevated blood cholesterol levels are prescribed statins at approximately a quarter of the rate of the general population. Furthermore, certain atypical antipsychotic drugs increase total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, and decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which increases the risk of coronary heart disease (Hennekens et al., 2005). </p>
<p>Among patients with co-occurring schizophrenia and metabolic disorders, rates of non-treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypertension were 62.4 percent for hypertension and 88.0 percent for hyperlipidemia (Nasrallah et al., 2006). Atypical antipsychotic medications elevate the risk of metabolic conditions, relative to typical antipsychotic medications (Nasrallah, 2008).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In 2010, heart disease and diabetes were the leading causes of death in the United States (U.S.) (Murphy, Xu, &amp; Kochanek, 2013). Because persons with serious mental illness who use antipsychotics are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, screening and monitoring of these conditions is important. </li>
    <li>The total cost of cardiovascular disease in 2010 was estimated to be $315.4 billion (Go et al., 2014). </li>
    <li>Cardiovascular disease is the greatest contributor to death in patients with schizophrenia (Capasso et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>Lack of appropriate care for diabetes and cardiovascular disease for people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who use antipsychotic medications can lead to worsening health and death. Addressing these physical health needs is an important way to improve health and economic outcomes downstream. </li>
