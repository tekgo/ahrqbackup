Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a new diagnosis or recurrent episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) with evidence that they met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for MDD AND for whom there is an assessment of depression severity during the visit in which a new diagnosis or recurrent episode was identified.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Chronic depression often goes unrecognized and untreated. The recognition and appropriate treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) is dependent on a thorough diagnostic outcome assessment and an evaluation of the degree of severity of the disorder. A diagnostic assessment can help clinicians tailor a patient's treatment to their needs. It can help clinicians rule out general medical conditions or other psychiatric conditions which may be contributing to depressive symptomology. An assessment of severity can also help clinicians tailor a patient's treatment. As noted in clinical guidelines, treatment methods should vary by the severity of depression. A diagnostic evaluation should be instituted for all patients with MDD to determine whether a diagnosis of depression is warranted and to reveal the presence of other conditions that may have an impact on treatment. </p>
<p>MDD is associated with functional impairment, impairments in interpersonal relationships and family functioning, work or performance, maintenance of health and hygiene, deficits in quality of life and the risk of suicide. It results in a significant economic burden in the United States. At the same time, provider assessment of depression underestimates the true occurrence of the MDD, because many individuals with the disorder never seek care for it and primary care providers (PCP) often do not recognize or diagnose it (Hepner et al., 2007). Hepner and colleagues found that only 34% of patients receive a depression history and symptom assessment by their PCP.</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines. Only selected portions of the clinical guidelines are quoted here; for more details, please refer to the full guideline</strong>.</p>
<p>Patients should receive a thorough diagnostic assessment in order to establish the diagnosis of MDD, identify other psychiatric or general medical conditions that may require attention, and develop a comprehensive plan for treatment (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2010)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Criteria for Major Depressive Episode</span> </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>At least five of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either 1) depressed mood or 2) loss of interest or pleasure (do not include symptoms that are clearly due to general medical condition or mood incongruent or hallucinations):
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
        <li>Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful) </li>
        <li>Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others) </li>
        <li>Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% body weight in a month), or decrease in appetite nearly every day </li>
        <li>Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day </li>
        <li>Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down) </li>
        <li>Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day </li>
        <li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick) </li>
        <li>Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or observed by others) </li>
        <li>Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or specific plan for committing suicide </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode </li>
    <li>The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning </li>
    <li>The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism) </li>
    <li>The symptoms are not better accounted for by bereavement, i.e., after the loss of a loved one, the symptoms persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation (APA, 2000). </li>
</ol>
<p>MDD can alter functioning in numerous spheres of life including work, school, family, social relationships, leisure activities, or maintenance of health and hygiene. The psychiatrist (clinician) should evaluate the patient's activity in each of these domains and determine the presence, type, severity, and chronicity of any dysfunction (APA, 2010). </p>
<p>In developing a treatment plan, interventions should be aimed at maximizing the patient's level of functioning as well as helping the patient to set specific goals appropriate to his or her functional impairments and symptom severity (APA, 2010).</p>
<p>If criteria are currently met for the major depressive episode, it can be classified as mild, moderate, severe without psychotic features, or severe with psychotic features. (The fifth digit [in the diagnostic codes for MDD] indicates the severity as follows: 1 for mild severity, 2 for moderate severity, 3 for severe without psychotic features, and 4 for severe with psychotic features) (APA, 2000).</p>
<p>Severity is judged to be mild, moderate, or severe based on the number of criteria symptoms, the severity of the symptoms, and the degree of functional disability and distress (APA, 2000).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Mild episodes are characterized by the presence of only five or six depressive symptoms and either mild disability or the capacity to function normally but with substantial and unusual effort. </li>
    <li>Episodes that are severe without psychotic features are characterized by the presence of most of the criteria symptoms and clear-cut, observable disability (e.g., inability to work or care for children). </li>
    <li>Moderate episodes have a severity that is intermediate between mild and severe. </li>
    <li>(Severe with psychotic features) indicates the presence of either delusions or hallucinations (typically auditory). The clinician can indicate the nature of the psychotic features by specifying with mood-congruent features (i.e., content of the delusions or hallucinations are consistent with the depressive themes) or with mood-incongruent features (i.e., content of the delusions or hallucinations has no apparent relationship to depressive themes). </li>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Prevalence and Incidence</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depressive disorder affects approximately 14.8 million American adults, or about 6.7 percent of the U.S. population aged 18 and older in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2010). </li>
    <li>While major depressive disorder can develop at any age, the median age at onset is 32 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>Major depressive disorder is more prevalent in women than in men (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>Depressive disorders are more common among persons with chronic conditions (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and cancer) and among those with unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity, and binge drinking) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disability</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for ages 15 to 44 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suicide</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Research has shown that more than 90% of people who kill themselves have depression or another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder (Conwell &amp; Brent, 1995). </li>
    <li>Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the 30,000 reported suicides in the U.S. each year (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). </li>
    <li>The suicide rate for older adults is more than 50% higher than the rate for the nation as a whole. Up to two-thirds of older adult suicides are attributed to untreated or misdiagnosed depression (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disparities</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic persons of other races are more likely to report major depression than non-Hispanic whites, based on responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8), which covers eight of the nine criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) for diagnosis of major depressive disorder (CDC, 2010). </li>
    <li>For individuals who experienced a depressive disorder in the past year, 63.7% of Latinos, 68.7% of Asians, and 58.8% of African Americans, compared with 40.2% of non-Latino whites, did not access any mental health treatment in the past year (Alegr&iacute;a et al., 2008). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Populations: Geriatrics</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The rate of depression in adults older than 65 years of age ranges from 7% to 36% in medical outpatient clinics and increases to 40% in the hospitalized elderly (Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [ICSI], 2010). </li>
    <li>Comorbidities are more common in the elderly. The highest rates of depression are found in those with strokes (30% to 60%), coronary artery disease (up to 44%), cancer (up to 40%), Parkinson's disease (40%), and Alzheimer's disease (20% to 40%) (ICSI, 2010). </li>
    <li>Similar to other groups, the elderly with depression are more likely than younger patients to underreport depressive symptoms (ICSI, 2010). </li>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) conducted feasibility, reliability and validity testing for the Adult Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) measures. Overall, the measures were found to be valid and reliable. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><em>Face Validity Testing</em>. Face validity of the measure score was assessed for two of the seven measures. The expert panel members were asked to empirically assess face validity of these measures via online survey. The expert panel consisted of 22 members, whose specialties include psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, family medicine, pharmaceutical science, endocrinology, internal medicine, methodology, nursing, psychiatric nursing, psychology, occupational therapy, social work, critical care medicine, geriatrics, health plan representative, and a patient representative.
    <p>After the measure was fully specified, the expert panel was asked to rate their agreement with the following statement: "The scores obtained from the measure, as specified, will provide an accurate reflection of quality and can be used to distinguish good and poor quality." </p>
    <p><em>Face Validity Testing Results</em>. On a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 (Strongly Disagree); 3 (Neither Agree nor Disagree); 5 (Strongly Agree), the mean rating for this measure was 4.65. </p>
    </li>
    <li><em>Reliability Testing</em>. Parallel forms reliability testing (i.e., manual review of the patient medical record versus an automated report of patient information from the electronic health record [EHR]) was conducted at three practice sites on two of the seven Adult MDD measures (i.e., measures 1 and 2). These sites represent various types, locations and sizes. Agreement rates were calculated at the measure level for the denominator, numerator and exceptions categories. Measure agreement was established based on the results of this analysis.
    <p><em>Reliability Testing Results</em>. The PCPI measure testing project revealed that this measure demonstrated substantial agreement in the numerator category.</p>
