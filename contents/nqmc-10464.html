<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have documented the disease type, anatomic location and activity, at least once during the reporting year.</p></div>
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>: </p>
<p>After the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) has been confirmed, the disease extent should be defined, because it determines the best route for therapy. For UC the extent is defined as the proximal margin of macroscopic inflammation, because this is most clearly related to the risk of complications, including dilatation and cancer. The implications of limited macroscopic disease with extensive microscopic inflammation remain unclear. For CD both small bowel and colon should be assessed (Carter et al., 2004).</p>
<p>Therapeutic options are determined by an assessment of the disease location, severity, and extraintestinal complications. In the absence of a "gold standard" for the measurement of disease activity, severity is established on clinical parameters, systemic manifestations, and the global impact of the disease on the individual's quality of life (Lichtenstein et al., 2009). </p>
<p>After the diagnosis of UC is confirmed, the anatomic extent is assessed endoscopically. The key question to be addressed at this point is whether the inflammation is "distal" (i.e., limited to below the descending colon and hence within reach of topical therapy) or extends proximal to the descending colon, requiring systemic medication. Therefore, a delineation of the proximal margin of inflammation, if not achieved on initial evaluation, is desirable at some point once the patient's condition permits. From a practical standpoint, the endoscopic extent and clinical severity of an acute attack determine the approach to therapy. Importantly, a flare-up during which distal disease extends proximally is often a severe episode with the need for early aggressive therapy. Although therapeutic decisions are rarely based on histologic severity of inflammation, histology may well be taken into account when planning a surveillance regimen. Based on clinical and endoscopic findings, the severity and extent of the disease are characterized. Severity may be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or fulminant (Kornbluth, Sachar, &amp; Practice Parameters Committee of the American College of Gastroenterology [ACG], 2010). </p>
<p>In addition to the evaluation of colitis extent and activity, a global assessment of the patient should include attention to general health concerns, and quality of life issues that may be influenced by colitis activity as well as by extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) of the disease (Kornbluth, Sachar, &amp; Practice Parameters Committee of the ACG, 2010). </p></div>
