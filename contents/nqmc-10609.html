<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure looks at the use of prenatal care services. It tracks Medicaid-enrolled women who had live births during the past year to determine the percentage of recommended prenatal visits they had.</p>
<p>Complications can arise at any time during pregnancy. For that reason, continued monitoring throughout pregnancy is necessary. Frequency and adequacy of ongoing prenatal visits are important factors in minimizing pregnancy problems. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that prenatal care begin as early as possible in the first trimester of pregnancy (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] &amp; ACOG, 2002). Visits should follow a schedule:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Every 4 weeks for the first 28 weeks of pregnancy </li>
    <li>Every 2 to 3 weeks for the next 7 weeks </li>
    <li>Weekly thereafter until delivery </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although many women experience uncomplicated pregnancies, timely and adequate prenatal care can prevent poor birth outcomes (Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2012). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (2012) recommend that a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy be examined every 4 weeks for the first 28 weeks of pregnancy, every 2 to 3 weeks until 36 weeks of gestation and weekly thereafter. </li>
    <li>In 2012, the low-birth weight rate was 8 percent and the preterm birth rate was 11.5 percent (Martin et al., 2013). The cost of lost work and pay over the lifespan of babies born preterm is $5.7 billion (March of Dimes Foundation, 2013). </li>
    <li>Each year in the United States, one in eight infants is born preterm. In 2009, preterm births represented 35 percent of infant deaths (Partridge et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Nearly 30 percent of pregnant women 25 years of age and older do not receive timely prenatal care (Maternal and Child Health Bureau [MCHB], 2011). Pregnancies with limited prenatal care have twice the risk of preterm birth and infant mortality than pregnancies with sufficient care (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). </li>
    <li>Appropriate perinatal services and education are crucial components of a healthy birth. Understanding how to stay healthy is important for preventing complications that can affect the health of both mother and baby before, during and after pregnancy. </li>
</ul>
