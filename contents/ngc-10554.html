<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Internal Guidelines Development Program. See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p>Recommendations are marked as <strong>[new 2014], [2014], [2004]</strong> or <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>[new 2014]</strong> indicates that the evidence has been reviewed and the recommendation has been added or updated </li>
    <li><strong>[2014]</strong> indicates that the evidence has been reviewed but no change has been made to the recommended action </li>
    <li><strong>[2004]</strong> indicates that the evidence has not been reviewed since 2004 </li>
    <li><strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong> indicates that the evidence has not been reviewed since 2004, but changes have been made to the recommendation wording that change the meaning. </li>
</ul>
<p>The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example, words such as 'offer' and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation) and is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Community Pharmacist</span></strong></p>
<p>Community pharmacists should offer initial and ongoing help for people with symptoms of dyspepsia. This includes advice about lifestyle changes, using over-the-counter medication, help with prescribed drugs and advice about when to consult a general practitioner (GP). <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Community pharmacists should record adverse reactions to treatment and may participate in primary care medication review clinics. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common Elements of Care</span></strong></p>
<p>Offer simple lifestyle advice, including advice on healthy eating, weight reduction and smoking cessation. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Advise people to avoid known precipitants they associate with their dyspepsia where possible. These include smoking, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, fatty foods and being overweight. Raising the head of the bed and having a main meal well before going to bed may help some people. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Provide people with access to educational materials to support the care they receive. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Recognise that psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and psychotherapy, may reduce dyspeptic symptoms in the short term in individual people. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Encourage people who need long-term management of dyspepsia symptoms to reduce their use of prescribed medication stepwise: by using the effective lowest dose, by trying 'as-needed' use when appropriate, and by returning to self-treatment with antacid and/or alginate therapy (unless there is an underlying condition or comedication that needs continuing treatment). <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral Guidance for Endoscopy</span></strong></p>
<p>For people presenting with dyspepsia together with significant acute gastrointestinal bleeding, refer them immediately (on the same day) to a specialist. <strong>[2004]</strong> (see also the NGC summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/content.aspx?id=37563" title="Guideline #9131">Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding: management</a> [NICE clinical guideline 141].)</p>
<p>Review medications for possible causes of dyspepsia (for example, calcium antagonists, nitrates, theophyllines, bisphosphonates, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). In people needing referral, suspend NSAID use. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Think about the possibility of cardiac or biliary disease as part of the differential diagnosis. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>If people have had a previous endoscopy and do not have any new alarm signs* consider continuing management according to previous endoscopic findings. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p class="Note">*For more information about alarm signs see the NICE guideline <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG27" title="NICE Web site">Referral for suspected cancer</a> ([NICE clinical guideline 27] [update in progress; publication expected May 2015. For more information see <a href="http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG/Wave0/618" title="NICE Web site">http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG/Wave0/618]</a>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interventions for Uninvestigated Dyspepsia</span></strong></p>
<p>Be aware that dyspepsia in unselected people in primary care is defined broadly to include people with recurrent epigastric pain, heartburn or acid regurgitation, with or without bloating, nausea or vomiting. Also see the recommendations under "Common Elements of Care" above. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Leave a 2-week washout period after proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use before testing for <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (hereafter referred to as <em>H pylori</em>) with a breath test or a stool antigen test. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Offer empirical full-dose PPI therapy (see Table 1 in Appendix A in the original guideline document) for 4 weeks to people with dyspepsia. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Offer <em>H pylori</em> 'test and treat' to people with dyspepsia. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>If symptoms return after initial care strategies, step down PPI therapy to the lowest dose needed to control symptoms. Discuss using the treatment on an 'as-needed' basis with people to manage their own symptoms. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Offer H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist (H<sub>2</sub>RA) therapy if there is an inadequate response to a PPI. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reviewing Patient Care</span></strong></p>
<p>Offer people who need long-term management of dyspepsia symptoms an annual review of their condition, and encourage them to try stepping down or stopping treatment (unless there is an underlying condition or comedication that needs continuing treatment). <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Advise people that it may be appropriate for them to return to self-treatment with antacid and/or alginate therapy (either prescribed or purchased over-the-counter and taken as needed). <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interventions for Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)</span></strong></p>
<p>Manage uninvestigated 'reflux-like' symptoms as uninvestigated dyspepsia. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Offer people with GORD a full-dose PPI (see Table 1 in Appendix A in the original guideline document) for 4 or 8 weeks. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>If symptoms recur after initial treatment, offer a PPI at the lowest dose possible to control symptoms. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Discuss with people how they can manage their own symptoms by using the treatment when they need it. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Offer H<sub>2</sub>RA therapy if there is an inadequate response to a PPI. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>People who have had dilatation of an oesophageal stricture should remain on long-term full-dose PPI therapy (see Table 1 in Appendix A in the original guideline document). <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Offer people a full-dose PPI (see Table 2 in Appendix A in the original guideline document) for 8 weeks to heal severe oesophagitis, taking into account the person's preference and clinical circumstances (for example, underlying health conditions and possible interactions with other drugs). <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p>
<p>If initial treatment for healing severe oesophagitis fails, consider a high dose of the initial PPI, switching to another full-dose PPI or switching to another high-dose PPI (see Table 2 in Appendix A in the original guideline document), taking into account the person's preference and clinical circumstances (for example, tolerability of the initial PPI, underlying health conditions and possible interactions with other drugs). <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Offer a full-dose PPI (see Table 2 in Appendix A in the original guideline document) long-term as maintenance treatment for people with severe oesophagitis, taking into account the person's preference and clinical circumstances (for example, tolerability of the PPI, underlying health conditions and possible interactions with other drugs), and the acquisition cost of the PPI. <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p>
<p>If the person's severe oesophagitis fails to respond to maintenance treatment, carry out a clinical review. Consider switching to another PPI at full dose or high dose (see Table 2 in Appendix A in the original guideline document), taking into account the person's preference and clinical circumstances, and/or seeking specialist advice. <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Do not routinely offer endoscopy to diagnose Barrett's oesophagus, but consider it if the person has GORD. Discuss the person's preferences and their individual risk factors (for example, long duration of symptoms, increased frequency of symptoms, previous oesophagitis, previous hiatus hernia, oesophageal stricture or oesophageal ulcers, or male gender). <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interventions for Peptic Ulcer Disease</span></strong></p>
<p>Offer <em>H pylori</em> eradication therapy to people who have tested positive for <em>H pylori</em> and who have peptic ulcer disease. Also see "<em>H pylori</em> Testing and Eradication," below. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>For people using NSAIDs with diagnosed peptic ulcer, stop the use of NSAIDs where possible. Offer full-dose PPI (see Table 1 in Appendix A in the original guideline document) or H<sub>2</sub>RA therapy for 8 weeks and, if <em>H pylori</em> is present, subsequently offer eradication therapy. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Offer people with gastric ulcer and <em>H pylori</em> repeat endoscopy 6 to 8 weeks after beginning treatment, depending on the size of the lesion. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Offer people with peptic ulcer (gastric or duodenal) and <em>H pylori</em> retesting for <em>H pylori</em> 6 to 8 weeks after beginning treatment, depending on the size of the lesion. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Offer full-dose PPI (see Table 1 in Appendix A in the original guideline document) or H<sub>2</sub>RA therapy for 4 to 8 weeks to people who have tested negative for <em>H pylori</em> who are not taking NSAIDs. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>For people continuing to take NSAIDs after a peptic ulcer has healed, discuss the potential harm from NSAID treatment. Review the need for NSAID use regularly (at least every 6 months) and offer a trial of use on a limited, 'as needed' basis. Consider reducing the dose, substituting an NSAID with paracetamol, or using an alternative analgesic or low-dose ibuprofen (1.2 g daily). <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>In people at high risk (previous ulceration) and for whom NSAID continuation is necessary, offer gastric protection or consider substitution with a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective NSAID. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>In people with an unhealed ulcer, exclude non-adherence, malignancy, failure to detect <em>H pylori</em>, inadvertent NSAID use, other ulcer-inducing medication and rare causes such as Zollinger&ndash;Ellison syndrome or Crohn's disease. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>If symptoms recur after initial treatment, offer a PPI to be taken at the lowest dose possible to control symptoms. Discuss using the treatment on an 'as needed' basis with people to manage their own symptoms. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Offer H<sub>2</sub>RA therapy if there is an inadequate response to a PPI. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interventions for Functional Dyspepsia</span></strong></p>
<p>Manage endoscopically determined functional dyspepsia using initial treatment for <em>H pylori</em> if present, followed by symptomatic management and periodic monitoring. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Offer eradication therapy to people testing positive for <em>H pylori</em>. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Do not routinely offer retesting after eradication, although the information it provides may be valued by individual people. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>If <em>H pylori</em> has been excluded and symptoms persist, offer either a low-dose PPI (see Table 1 in Appendix A in the original guideline document) or an H<sub>2</sub>RA for 4 weeks. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>If symptoms continue or recur after initial treatment, offer a PPI or H<sub>2</sub>RA to be taken at the lowest dose possible to control symptoms. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Discuss using PPI treatment on an 'as-needed' basis with people to manage their own symptoms. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Avoid long-term, frequent dose, continuous antacid therapy (it only relieves symptoms in the short term rather than preventing them). <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Helicobacter Pylori</em> Testing and Eradication</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>Test for <em>H pylori</em> using a carbon-13 urea breath test or a stool antigen test, or laboratory-based serology where its performance has been locally validated. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Perform retesting for <em>H pylori</em> using a carbon-13 urea breath test. (There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the stool antigen test as a test of eradication&dagger;.) <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Do not use office-based serological tests for <em>H pylori</em> because of their inadequate performance. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p class="Note">&dagger;This refers to evidence reviewed in 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Eradication</strong></p>
<p><em>First-Line Treatment</em></p>
<p>Offer people who test positive for <em>H pylori</em> a 7-day, twice-daily course of treatment with:</p>

</ul>
<p class="Note">&para;In the NICE <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG27" title="NICE Web site">Referral guidelines for suspected cancer</a> (NICE clinical guideline 27), 'unexplained' is defined as 'a symptom(s) and/or sign(s) that has not led to a diagnosis being made by the primary care professional after initial assessment of the history, examination and primary care investigations (if any)'. (Please note that an update is in progress; publication expected May 2015. For more information see <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/InDevelopment/GID-CGWAVE0618" title="NICE WEb site">http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/InDevelopment/GID-CGWAVE0618</a>.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surveillance for People with Barrett's Oesophagus</span></strong></p>
<p>Consider surveillance to check progression to cancer for people who have a diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus (confirmed by endoscopy and histopathology), taking into account:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The presence of dysplasia (see the NICE guideline Barrett's oesophagus &ndash; ablative therapy for the treatment of Barrett's oesophagus [NICE clinical guideline 106]) </li>
    <li>The person's individual preference </li>
    <li>The person's risk factors (for example, male gender, older age and the length of the Barrett's oesophagus segment) </li>
</ul>
<p>Emphasise that the harms of endoscopic surveillance may outweigh the benefits in people who are at low risk of progression to cancer (for example, people with stable non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus). <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Wording in Guideline Updates</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2004]</strong> (see above for details about how recommendations are labelled). In particular, for recommendations labelled <strong>[2004]</strong> the word 'consider' may not necessarily be used to denote the strength of the recommendation.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: This guideline was developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Internal Guidelines Development Program. See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for the full version of this guidance.</p>
<p>Full systematic reviews of each review questions for the update strictly followed the review protocols (see Appendix C of the full version of the guideline document) as set out based on the Guideline Manual 2012, and agreed by the Guideline Development Group (GDG). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used for appraising the quality of the evidence where appropriate, and the Linking Evidence to Recommendations (LETR) framework was adopted to transparently document the GDG's decision-making process. Further information on the modified GRADE approach and network meta-analysis is documented in Appendix C, Section C3 and Appendix E in the full version of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of the Modified GRADE Approach</span></strong></p>
<p>For the review questions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Review question 1: When should (and with what indications) patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia be referred for endoscopy for further investigation and review of treatment plan? </li>
    <li>Review question 2: Which risk factors indicate endoscopy in order to exclude Barrett's oesophagus? </li>
    <li>Review question 3: Which patient characteristics/clinical indicators/criteria indicate referral of a patient with dyspepsia, heartburn, or confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) managed in primary care to a consultant led medical or surgical service (specialist services)? </li>
</ul>
<p>For the above three review questions, a modified-GRADE approach was used for critical appraisal and evidence synthesis to aid decision making.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome vs Individual Study, and Meta-analysis</strong></p>
<p>In GRADE approach for intervention question, the quality of evidence on each outcome is assessed according to the impact of the risk of bias from the study to that particular outcome. If there is more than one study that reported such outcome, the overall judgement of the quality for that outcome across different studies will be made. This is because in the same intervention study (e.g., randomised controlled trial [RCT]), there may be different levels or magnitude of the impact of the risk of bias on different outcomes measured in the same study. For example, in a single-blinded RCT (assessor-blinded only) on antibiotics for infected wound, the risk of bias for patient-reported pain of the wound (outcome 1) would be different compared to bacteria eradication rate (based on histology) (outcome 2) due to the single-blinded design of the study.</p>
<p>In a prognostic study (or clinical prediction model), these varying degrees of risk of bias in a study do not apply same as in an intervention study. This is because in a multivariate regression model (MRM), the sources of the risk of bias commonly came from how the data of the individual risk factors or predictors was collected as a whole in a study, and what kinds of adjustment were made in the MRM regarding baseline confounders and covariates. Hence, the risk of bias in a study would have impacted the MRM as whole (i.e., all risk factors or predictors entered in the MRM equally). Therefore, the quality of an individual study would apply across to all risk factors or predictors in that particular individual study.</p>
<p>Due to the varying methods used in different studies (e.g., different multivariate regression models in different studies used different dependent variables as risk factors or predictors, used different covariates, adjusted for different confounding factors), in other words, there are no two exactly identical multivariate regression models that could be pooled in its entirety. The only approach to conduct meta-analysis is to obtain individual participant data (IPD) data from each study and then re-run a single MRM using all the IPD data from all included studies. This would be outside the development timeframe of this guideline.</p>
<p>Therefore, no meta-analysis was conducted to combine individual risk factors or predictors across different MRMs in different studies. Nevertheless, if there are more than one included studies for a particular risk factor or predictor, the evidence would be presented based on individual risk factors or predictors across different studies to aid discussion and decision making. Otherwise, the evidence would be presented as individual studies.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria and Downgrading</strong></p>
<p>There are four quality categories in GRADE, namely 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low' and 'Very low'. For prognostic study (or clinical prediction model), case control or cross-sectional study was considered as appropriate study designs and hence under the modified-GRADE approach, these two study designs would start from 'High' quality (or high 'confidence' in the effect estimates). Then the evidence would be downgraded based on a modified framework.</p></div>

<h3>
Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words are used (for example, 'do not offer&hellip;') when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions That Could Be Used</strong></p>
<p>The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Wording in Guideline Updates</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2004]</strong> (see the "Major Recommendations" field for details about how recommendations are labelled). In particular, for recommendations labelled <strong>[2004]</strong> the word 'consider' may not necessarily be used to denote the strength of the recommendation.</p></div>

Potential Harms

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is a small but definite risk of harm (perforation and gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding) from the endoscopy procedure. </li>
    <li>Misoprostol is associated with a significant incidence of diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain. </li>
    <li><em>Helicobacter pylori</em> eradication regimens are associated with antibiotic resistance and adverse events including loose stools, dermatitis, rash, mouth dryness, oral candidiasis, and abnormal liver function test. </li>
    <li>Low-quality evidence from 3 randomised controlled trials showed that there were significantly more serious adverse events (bleeding, perforation, pneumothorax, dysphagia) in patients receiving laparoscopic fundoplication than those treated by medical management including a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). </li>
    <li>Adverse effects of PPIs </li>
    <li>There is some concern about the renal and cardiovascular safety of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). While reporting a similar reduction in ulceration to celecoxib, the VIGOR trial of rofecoxib reported an excess of cardiovascular deaths. The trial comparing celecoxib with diclofenac and omeprazole found that celecoxib was as likely to cause acute renal failure in patients with pre-existing renal impairment as diclofenac (40%). A recent review of the VIGOR and CLASS trials found that severe non-gastrointestinal adverse events actually increased in patients receiving a COX-2 selective NSAIDs. While COX-2 selective NSAIDs do appear to reduce gastrointestinal harm, severe events are rare and the clinical benefit may be small in any but those at high risk of ulceration. </li>

    <li>This guidance represents the view of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summaries of product characteristics of any drugs. </li>
    <li>Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. </li>
    <li>Patients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england" title="UK NHS Web site">National Health Service (NHS) Constitution for England</a> &ndash; all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care should take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reference-guide-to-consent-for-examination-or-treatment-second-edition" title="UK Department of Health Web site">Department of Health's advice on consent</a>. If someone does not have capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/protecting-the-vulnerable/mental-capacity-act" title="UK Department of Justice Web site">code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act</a> and the supplementary <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085476" title="UK Web Archive Web iste">code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards</a>. </li>
    <li>NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG138" title="NICE Web site">Patient experience in adult NHS services</a>. </li>
    <li>The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients. </li>
    <li>This guideline recommends some drugs for indications for which they do not have a United Kingdom (UK) marketing authorisation at the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that use. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The patient (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be documented. See the General Medical Council's <a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/14316.asp" title="General Medical Council Web site">Good practice in prescribing and managing medicines and devices</a> for further information. Where recommendations have been made for the use of drugs outside their licensed indications ('off-label use'), these drugs are marked with a footnote in the recommendations. </li>
    <li>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision. </li>

<p>For people presenting with dyspepsia together with significant acute gastrointestinal bleeding, refer them immediately (on the same day) to a specialist. <strong>[2004]</strong> (see the National Guideline Clearinghouse [NGC] summary of the NICE guideline <a href="/content.aspx?id=37563" title="Guideline #9131">Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding: management</a> [NICE clinical guideline 141].)</p>
<p><strong>Interventions for Uninvestigated Dyspepsia</strong></p>
<p>Leave a 2-week washout period after proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use before testing for <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (hereafter referred to as <em>H pylori</em>) with a breath test or a stool antigen test. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interventions for Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)</strong></p>
<p>Offer people a full-dose PPI (see Table 2 in Appendix A in the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) for 8 weeks to heal severe oesophagitis, taking into account the person's preference and clinical circumstances (for example, underlying health conditions and possible interactions with other drugs). <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Offer a full-dose PPI (see Table 2 in Appendix A in the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) long-term as maintenance treatment for people with severe oesophagitis, taking into account the person's preference and clinical circumstances (for example, tolerability of the PPI, underlying health conditions and possible interactions with other drugs), and the acquisition cost of the PPI. <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p>
<p>Do not routinely offer endoscopy to diagnose Barrett's oesophagus, but consider it if the person has GORD. Discuss the person's preferences and their individual risk factors (for example, long duration of symptoms, increased frequency of symptoms, previous oesophagitis, previous hiatus hernia, oesophageal stricture or oesophageal ulcers, or male gender). <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interventions for Peptic Ulcer Disease</strong></p>
<p>Offer <em>H pylori</em> eradication therapy to people who have tested positive for <em>H pylori</em> and who have peptic ulcer disease. Also see the recommendations under <em>H pylori</em> testing and eradication. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>For people using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with diagnosed peptic ulcer, stop the use of NSAIDs where possible. Offer full-dose PPI (see Table 1 in Appendix A in the original guideline document) or H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist [H<sub>2</sub>RA] therapy for 8 weeks and, if <em>H pylori</em> is present, subsequently offer eradication therapy. <strong>[2004]</strong></p>
<p>Offer people with peptic ulcer (gastric or duodenal) and <em>H pylori</em> retesting for <em>H pylori</em> 6 to 8 weeks after beginning treatment, depending on the size of the lesion. <strong>[2004, amended 2014]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Referral to a Specialist Service</strong></p>
<p>Consider referral to a specialist service for people:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Of any age with gastro-oesophageal symptoms that are non-responsive to treatment or unexplained* </li>
    <li>With suspected GORD who are thinking about surgery </li>
    <li>With <em>H pylori</em> that has not responded to second-line eradication therapy. <strong>[new 2014]</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">*In the NICE <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG27" title="NICE Web site">Referral guidelines for suspected cancer</a> (NICE clinical guideline 27), 'unexplained' is defined as 'a symptom(s) and/or sign(s) that has not led to a diagnosis being made by the primary care professional after initial assessment of the history, examination and primary care investigations (if any)'. (Please note that an update is in progress; publication expected May 2015. For more information see <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/InDevelopment/GID-CGWAVE0618" title="NICE Web site">http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/InDevelopment/GID-CGWAVE0618</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Surveillance for People with Barrett's Oesophagus</strong></p>
<p>Consider surveillance to check progression to cancer for people who have a diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus (confirmed by endoscopy and histopathology), taking into account:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The presence of dysplasia (see the NICE guideline Barrett's oesophagus &ndash; ablative therapy for the treatment of Barrett's oesophagus [NICE clinical guideline 106]) </li>
    <li>The person's individual preference </li>
    <li>The person's risk factors (for example, male gender, older age and the length of the Barrett's oesophagus segment). </li>
</ul>
<p>Emphasise that the harms of endoscopic surveillance may outweigh the benefits in people who are at low risk of progression to cancer (for example, people with stable non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus). <strong>[new 2014]</strong></p></div>
