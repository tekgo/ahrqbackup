Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the Levels of Certainty regarding Net Benefit (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Recommendation and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends against screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults (<strong>D recommendation</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to screening in asymptomatic adults. It does not apply to persons who experience hoarseness, pain, difficulty swallowing, or other throat symptoms or persons who have lumps, swelling, asymmetry of the neck, or other reasons for a neck examination. It also does not apply to persons at increased risk of thyroid cancer because of a history of exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., medical treatment or radiation fallout), particularly persons with a diet low in iodine, an inherited genetic syndrome associated with thyroid cancer (e.g., familial adenomatous polyposis), or a first-degree relative with a history of thyroid cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>
<p>Although the USPSTF recommends against screening in the general asymptomatic adult population, several factors substantially increase the risk for thyroid cancer, including a history of radiation exposure to the head and neck as a child, exposure to radioactive fallout, family history of thyroid cancer in a first-degree relative, and certain genetic conditions, such as familial medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (type 2A or 2B).</p>
<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>
<p>Although screening for thyroid cancer using neck palpation and ultrasound of the thyroid has been studied, the USPSTF recommends against screening in the general asymptomatic adult population.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment and Interventions</strong></p>
<p>Surgery (i.e., total or partial thyroidectomy, with or without lymphadenectomy) is the main treatment of thyroid cancer. Additional treatment, including radioactive iodine therapy, may be indicated, depending on postoperative disease status, tumor stage, and type of thyroid cancer. External-beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy are not generally used to treat early-stage, differentiated thyroid cancer.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: A systematic evidence review was prepared by the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence-Based Practice Center (EPC) for use by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Sources and Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to locate primary studies that informed the key questions (KQs) and that were published from January 1966 through January 2016 (see eMethods in the systematic review supplement). The database searches were supplemented with expert suggestions and by reviewing reference lists from existing relevant systematic reviews. ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. Since January 2016, the systematic review authors continued to conduct ongoing surveillance through article alerts and targeted searches of high-impact journals to identify major studies published in the interim that may affect the conclusions or understanding of the evidence and therefore the related USPSTF recommendation. The last surveillance was conducted in December 2016. No studies were identified that would substantively change this review's interpretation of findings or conclusions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles against the specified inclusion criteria for studies of thyroid cancer screening, diagnostic accuracy, or treatment in screen relevant or asymptomatic adults. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus and consultation with a third investigator.</p>
<p>For screening questions (KQ1 through KQ3), any studies of asymptomatic adult populations were included, either those at general risk (e.g., unselected) or those with prior personal history of radiation exposure. Populations were excluded if they were selected based on high radiation exposure due to environmental disasters, inherited genetic syndromes associated with a high risk for developing thyroid cancer, or a personal history of thyroid cancer. Diagnostic accuracy studies of palpation or ultrasound had to include a reference standard (ultrasound for detection of nodules on palpation; histopathology results from fine-needle aspiration or surgery for detection of cancer on ultrasound), applied to both screen-positive and screen-negative persons (e.g., all or a random subset of screen-negative persons). For screening effectiveness (KQ1), any patient health outcome of reduced morbidity or mortality associated with thyroid cancer was included. For test performance (KQ2), cancer detection rates and measures of diagnostic accuracy (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) were included. For harms of screening (KQ3), direct harms of palpation and ultrasound, subsequent harms of diagnostic fine-needle aspiration, and measures of overdiagnosis were included. For overdiagnosis, studies that compared screened vs. unscreened groups were sought. Studies that examined the increasing incidence of thyroid cancers, studies of the incidence and natural history of thyroid nodules and cancers, and autopsy studies were not included but are summarized in the "Discussion" section of the systematic review.</p>
<p>For treatment questions (KQ4 and KQ5), any studies of thyroid surgery (complete thyroidectomy, near-total thyroidectomy, lobectomy), with or without lymph node dissection or with or without radioactive iodine ablation, were included. Studies of chemotherapy, external beam radiation, and other nonsurgical ablative treatment other than radioactive iodine were excluded. To approximate the treatment of screen-detected cancers, treatment studies including persons with metastatic disease or anaplastic thyroid cancers were excluded. For treatment benefit (KQ4), studies had to have a control group (e.g., untreated, surveillance, delayed treatment). To assess the benefit of treatment, the patient health outcomes of recurrence, mortality, and quality of life were considered. For treatment harms (KQ5), studies were not required to include a control group for direct procedural harms (e.g., hypoparathyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy) but needed a control group for other types of harms (e.g., second primary malignancies from radioactive iodine therapy). The evolution of standard of care for the diagnostic workup (e.g., use of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration) and treatment of thyroid cancer over time has resulted in a change in the case mix of patients getting surgery with or without lymph node dissection or radioactive iodine therapy, as well as improvements in surgical techniques and radioactive iodine administered activity (doses) over time. To identify the most applicable evidence, studies conducted before 1990 and single-surgeon case series were excluded.</p></div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Two reviewers independently critically appraised all articles that met inclusion criteria using the USPSTF design-specific quality criteria supplemented by the Newcastle Ottawa Scales for cohort and case-control studies and by QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) and QUADAS II for studies of diagnostic accuracy (see eTable 1 in the systematic review supplement). Poor-quality studies (those with a single fatal flaw or multiple important limitations that could invalidate results) were excluded from the review. Disagreements about critical appraisal were resolved by consensus and, if needed, consultation with a third independent reviewer. One reviewer extracted key data from included studies; a second reviewer checked the data for accuracy. Tables generally included details on study design and quality, setting and population (e.g., country, inclusion criteria, age, sex, race/ethnicity, risk factors for thyroid cancer), screening and treatment details, reference standard or comparator details (if applicable), length of follow-up, and outcomes (e.g., cancer yield, diagnostic accuracy, cancer morbidity, mortality, and harms).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>For each key question (KQ), the number and design of included studies, summary of results, consistency and precision of results, reporting bias, summary of study quality, limitations of the body of evidence, and applicability of the findings were summarized. Findings were synthesized by KQ, screening test (e.g., palpation, ultrasound) or treatment (e.g., type of surgery, radioactive iodine therapy), and type of outcome. Because of the limited number of studies and the clinical heterogeneity of studies, the analyses were largely descriptive.</p>
<p>Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation method to estimate the harms of surgical treatment of thyroid cancer (permanent hypoparathyroidism and permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy). In subgroup analysis when the number of studies was less than 5, a fixed-effects model was used. The presence and magnitude of statistical heterogeneity were assessed among pooled studies using the <em>I</em>&sup2; statistic. Visual inspection of plots stratified or ordered by key study characteristics accounting for clinical heterogeneity among studies was conducted to see if these characteristics affected rates of surgical complications. Key study characteristics included the type of surgery (e.g., partial or total thyroidectomy with or without lymph node dissection; type of lymph node dissection), case mix of patients (e.g., histology of thyroid cancer, average tumor size, average age), setting (e.g., country, year), and type and definition of outcome (e.g., criteria for permanent harm). It was not possible to evaluate associations of surgical complications with study quality (because all studies were fair quality) or surgical experience (because experience and surgical volume were not reported in individual studies). Funnel plots and the Egger linear regression method were used to examine whether the distribution of the effect sizes was symmetric with respect to effect precision.</p>
<p>Significance threshold was 2-sided<em> P</em> = .05. All analyses were performed using R version 3.2.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) systematically reviews the evidence concerning both the benefits and harms of widespread implementation of a preventive service. It then assesses the certainty of the evidence and the magnitude of the benefits and harms. On the basis of this assessment, the USPSTF assigns a letter grade to each preventive service signifying its recommendation about provision of the service (see table below). An important, but often challenging, step is determining the balance between benefits and harms to estimate "net benefit" (that is, benefits minus harms).</p>

<p class="Note">*<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group "invited for screening" and the group "not invited for screening."</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the USPSTF constructs a "chain of evidence" within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term <em>certainty</em> will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as "high" certainty (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as "moderate" certainty. Certainty is "low" when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peer Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality send the draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. The draft evidence review is also posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response to Public Comment</span></strong></p>
<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from November 22 to December 26, 2016. Many respondents shared personal stories of how their clinician noticed a lump during physical examination, often prompted by symptoms such as hoarseness or throat pain, and expressed concern that the recommendation would prevent diagnosis of such cancer cases. Clinicians who interpreted the recommendation as discouraging them from performing neck examination also expressed concern. In response, the USPSTF expanded the Clinical Considerations section to clarify that this recommendation does not apply to persons who experience hoarseness, pain, difficulty swallowing, or other throat symptoms or persons who have lumps, swelling, asymmetry of the neck, or to other reasons for a neck examination.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations of Others</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations for screening from the following groups were considered: the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination, the American Thyroid Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American College of Endocrinology, and the Associazione Medici Endocrinologi.</p></div>

However, the USPSTF determined that the magnitude of benefit can be bounded as no greater than small, based on the relative rarity of thyroid cancer, the apparent lack of difference in outcomes between patients who are treated versus only monitored (i.e., for the most common tumor types), and the observational evidence demonstrating no change in mortality over time after introduction of a population-based screening program.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/" title="USPSTF Web site">Web site</a>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size <em>Guide to Clinical Preventive Services</em>.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div>
