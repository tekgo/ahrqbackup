<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Scientific basis for measuring patient satisfaction after cataract surgery.
    <p>Patient satisfaction is a valuable performance indicator for measuring the quality of care delivered by ophthalmologists providing cataract surgery. In the broadest sense, patient satisfaction is an assessment of the patient's experience with the care process delivered by health plans, clinicians, health systems, hospitals, etc. This experience can cover domains as diverse as information/education, interpersonal manner, emotional support, accessibility, convenience, outcomes or results, environment, personalization, involvement in care, finances, etc.</p>
    <p>In 1996, the American Academy of Ophthalmology launched the National Eyecare Outcomes Network (NEON) database (Lum et al., 2000; Lum, Schachat, &amp; Jampel, 2002). From January 1, 1996 through March 30, 2001, 249 ophthalmologists at 114 different practice sites submitted data to the NEON cataract surgery database. Post-operative patient satisfaction responses were collected for 6,154 patients, or about 34.5% of all patients who had preoperative forms submitted. This assessment was performed at a median of 4.1 weeks postoperatively for all patients enrolled in the database. A 12-item questionnaire was used to assess patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction was associated with younger age and absence of ocular comorbidity. </p>
    <p>Other studies of patient satisfaction after cataract surgery were conducted in Austria and in Spain. The Austrian study found that patients with pre-existing eye disease, including those patients with improved visual acuity after surgery, were the least satisfied with the results of surgery (Mozaffarieh et al., 2004). In these cases, improved patient education prior to surgery could be helpful in improving patient satisfaction.&nbsp;The Spanish study found that patient satisfaction was associated with expectations prior to surgery (Lled&oacute; et al., 1998-1999).</p>
    <p>Most patients are satisfied with their care and results after cataract surgery. This outcome is achieved consistently through careful attention through the patient selection process, accurate measurement of axial length and corneal power, appropriate selection of an intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation formula, etc. As such, it reflects the care and diligence with which the surgery is assessed, planned and executed. Failure to achieve this satisfaction after surgery would reflect patterns of patient selection or treatment that should be assessed for opportunities for improvement.</p>
    <p>Use of this indicator in the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) claims-based reporting method would require some modification to the current reporting of post-operative care for patients undergoing cataract surgery, since this indicator would be operative during the 90 day global period. However, there is a strong and practical precedent for such modifications in that reporting arrangements have previously been made to accommodate co-management of care by different providers during the post-operative period. A similar adjustment to allow for filing of a claim of meeting this goal at one point in the 90 day global period would be sufficient, potentially drawing upon the methods to demarcate the onset of co-management transfer of post-operative care.</p>
    <p>Various patient satisfaction instruments exist, but an instrument developed by the program Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) develops and supports the use of a comprehensive and evolving family of standardized surveys that ask consumers and patients to report on and evaluate their experiences with health care. These surveys cover topics that are important to consumers, such as the communication skills of providers and the accessibility of services. AHRQ first launched the CAHPS program in October 1995 in response to concerns about the lack of good information about the quality of health plans from the enrollees' perspective. At that time, numerous public and private organizations collected information on enrollee and patient satisfaction, but the surveys varied from sponsor to sponsor and often changed from year to year.</p>
    <p>The CAHPS Surgical Care Survey asks adult patients to report on surgical care, surgeons, their staff, and anesthesiologists. It was developed by the American College of Surgeons and the Surgical Quality Alliance to assess patients' experiences before, during, and after surgery. In early 2010, the CAHPS Consortium voted to adopt the Surgical Care Survey as an official CAHPS survey. The Surgical Care Survey expands on the current CAHPS Clinician &amp; Group Survey, which focuses on primary and specialty care, by incorporating domains that are relevant to surgical care, such as informed consent, anesthesia care, and post-operative follow-up. The survey is unique in that it assesses patients' experiences with surgical care in both the inpatient and outpatient settings by asking respondents about their care before, during, and after surgery.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey is to address the need to assess and improve the experiences of surgical patients. Like other CAHPS surveys, this questionnaire focuses on aspects of surgical quality that are important to patients and for which patients are the best source of information. The survey results are expected to be useful to everyone with a need for information on the quality of surgeons and surgical care, including patients, practice groups, health plans, insurers, and specialty boards. Patients can use the information to help make better and more informed choices about their surgical care. Practices, health plans, and insurers can use the survey results for quality improvement initiatives and incentives. Specialty boards may use the survey for maintenance of certification.</p>
    <p>The composite measures of surgical quality from the CAHPS Surgical Care Survey that are most relevant and significant for this physician-level performance measure include: </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>How well surgeon communicates with patients before surgery </li>
        <li>How well surgeon communicates with patients after surgery </li>
        <li>Rating of overall care from this surgeon </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Evidence of a gap in care
    <p>This is an outcome of surgery indicator of direct relevance and import to patients, their families and referring providers. The available evidence suggests that cataract surgery achieves this in about 90% of patients. While the potential for improvement appears seemingly small, the volume of cataract surgery in the United States (U.S.) of over 2.8 million surgeries means that the impact could affect more than 100,000 patients per year. Ideally, performance on this indicator to be as high as possible, with rates lower than 95% to 100% suggestive of opportunities for improvement.</p>
