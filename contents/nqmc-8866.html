<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with diabetes with a documented glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of less than 7.0% or meeting the patient's individualized HbA1c goal.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease who receive education and an intervention for modifiable risk factors.</p>
<p>Modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be evaluated and may include smoking, inadequate physical activity, depression, hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Intervention involving any risk factor pertinent to the patient is encouraged and may include education, goal setting, and follow-up as necessary. For all patients, lifestyle modification, including exercise, smoking cessation, achieving and maintaining ideal body weight, and proven risk factor reduction will continue to be the focus of primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention.</p>
<p>Diabetes is associated with a marked increase in coronary artery disease. Patients with diabetes without known coronary artery disease have as high risk of a myocardial infarction as patients without diabetes with coronary artery disease. Therefore, patients with diabetes should have aggressive lipid and blood pressure management (similar to patients with coronary artery disease), and should be treated per the recommendations of the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) Diagnosis and Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Adults guideline, ICSI Lipid Management in Adults guideline and ICSI Hypertension Diagnosis and Treatment guidelines.</p>
<p>Every attempt should be made to achieve meticulous glucose control in patients with diabetes, because there is a clear relationship between lower hemoglobin A1c's and lower risk of myocardial infarction. In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), obese patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with metformin showed a statistically significant reduction in rates of myocardial infarction, suggesting metformin as a possible therapy of choice for these patients. A meta-analysis showed a 20% increase in cardiovascular events and mortality for every 1% increase in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) over 5%.</p></div>
