<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Search for Existing Guidelines</strong></span></p>
<p>As a first step in developing this guideline, a search for existing guidelines was undertaken to determine whether an existing guideline could be adapted or endorsed. To this end, the following sources were searched for existing guidelines that addressed the research questions:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Practice guideline databases: the <a href="http://www.cancerview.ca/TreatmentAndSupport/GRCMain/GRCSAGE/GRCSAGESearch/?lang=en" title="SAGE Web site">Standards and Guidelines Evidence Directory of Cancer Guidelines (SAGE)</a>, <a href="https://www.guideline.gov/" title="NGC Web site" target="_blank">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) National Guideline Clearinghouse</a>, and the <a href="https://www.cma.ca/En/Pages/SearchPage.aspx?k=guidelines" title="CMA Infobase Web site">Canadian Medical Association Infobase</a>. </li>
    <li>Guideline developer Web sites: <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/" title="NICE Web site">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)</a>, <a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/index.html" title="SIGN Web site">Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)</a>, <a href="http://www.asco.org/practice-guidelines/quality-guidelines/guidelines" title="ASCO Web site">American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines/search?subject=30699" title="NHMRC Web site">National Health and Medical Research Council - Australia</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following criteria were used to select potentially relevant guidelines:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Guideline databases and Web sites were searched using the following keyword "neuroendocrine." </li>
    <li>Only evidence-based guidelines published after 2010 (i.e., less than five years old) were considered. </li>
</ul>
<p>This search did not yield a guideline that could be adapted or endorsed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>This evidence review was conducted in two planned stages, including a search for systematic reviews followed by a search for primary literature.</p>
<p><strong>Search for Existing Systematic Reviews</strong></p>
<p>A search was conducted for existing systematic reviews. This included original systematic reviews and systematic reviews published as a component of practice guidelines. The MEDLINE (2008 to June 13, 2016) and EMBASE (2008 to June 13, 2016) databases, as well as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008 to June 13, 2016), Cancer Agencies for Drug and Technologies in Health (August 27, 2015) and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (August 27, 2015) were searched for published systematic reviews. The full search strategy is available in Appendix 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Identified systematic reviews were evaluated based on their clinical content and relevance. Relevant systematic reviews were assessed using the 11-item Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool to determine whether or not it could be incorporated as part of the evidentiary base.</p>
<p><strong>Search for Primary Literature</strong></p>
<p>In the absence of any relevant systematic reviews, a search was conducted for primary literature.</p>
<p>The MEDLINE (2008 to June 13, 2016) and EMBASE (2008 to June 13, 2016) databases were searched for published phase II and III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. The full search strategy is available in Appendix 2 in the original guideline document. Reference lists of included primary literature were scanned for additional citations. The following conference proceedings were also searched from 2008 to 2015: ASCO, ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, European Society for Medical Oncology, European Cancer Congress, European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society, and North American Neuroendocrine Tumour Society.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria and Process</strong></p>
<p><em>Inclusion Criteria</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Prospective (phase II and III) and retrospective studies with &ge;20 participants </li>
    <li>Studies assessing adult patients with incurable gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). At least 80% of the patients evaluated for the outcomes in each study should have GEP NETs as opposed to other types of NETs (e.g., lung, unknown primary, etc.) </li>
    <li>Studies that reported on or compared the effects of any of the systematic therapies (i.e., chemotherapy, somatostatin analogues [SSAs] or interferon &alpha;, and targeted therapies [i.e., sunitinib, everolimus, bevacizumab, pazopanib]) on any of the following clinical outcomes: progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and median survival, with or without biomarker decreases (i.e., chromogranin A, pancreastatin, glucagon), quality of life, and adverse effects </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Exclusion Criteria</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Studies assessing the following conditions: pituitary tumours, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, thymic tumours, goblet cell carcinoma, bronchial NETs, paragangliomas, mixed NETs, pheochromocytoma, small cell lung cancer, and thyroid cancer </li>
    <li>Abstracts of non-randomized studies (single-arm clinical trials, case series, etc.) </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction and Assessment of Study Quality and Potential for Bias</span></strong></p>
<p>Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and audited by a second independent auditor. Ratios, including hazard ratios (HRs), were expressed with a ratio &lt;1.0 indicating improved efficacy for the experimental arm. Important risks of bias, such as statistical power calculations, sample size, methods of randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, intention to treat analysis, and source of funding were extracted for each randomized study. Criteria from the ROBINS-I tool were used to assess the risk of bias for all non-randomized studies.</p>
<p>Criteria from the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method were used to assess the quality of the aggregate evidence for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. Four factors were assessed for each outcome in each comparison: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synthesizing the Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>A meta-analysis was not planned due to the heterogeneity across trials and the inclusion of a large number of single-arm studies.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Developers</span></strong></p>
<p>This guideline was developed by the Gastrointestinal Disease Site Group (GI DSG) (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document), which was convened at the request of the Disease Pathway Management Group. The project was led by a small Working Group of the GI DSG, which was responsible for reviewing the evidence base, drafting the guideline recommendations, and responding to comments received during the document review process. The Working Group had expertise in radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgery, and health research methodology. Other members of the GI DSG served as the Expert Panel and were responsible for the review and approval of the draft document produced by the Working Group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>The Program in Evidence-Based Care (PEBC) produces evidence-based and evidence-informed guidance documents using the methods of the Practice Guidelines Development Cycle. This process includes a systematic review, interpretation of the evidence by the Working Group, draft recommendations, internal review by content and methodology experts, and external review by Ontario clinicians and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The PEBC uses the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II framework as a methodological strategy for guideline development. AGREE II is a 23-item validated tool that is designed to assess the methodological rigour and transparency of guideline development.</p>
<p>The currency of each document is ensured through periodic review and evaluation of the scientific literature and, where appropriate, the addition of newer literature to the original evidence base. This is described in the PEBC Document Assessment and Review Protocol (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). PEBC guideline recommendations are based on clinical evidence, and not on feasibility of implementation; however, a list of implementation considerations such as costs, human resources, and unique requirements for special or disadvantaged populations is provided along with the recommendations for information purposes. PEBC guideline development methods are described in more detail in the PEBC Handbook and the PEBC Methods Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Research Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Which of the anti-neoplastic systemic therapies (i.e., chemotherapy, somatostatin analogues [SSAs] and interferon &alpha;, and targeted therapies [i.e., sunitinib, everolimus, bevacizumab, pazopanib]) is the most effective in improving clinical outcomes (i.e., progression-free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS], objective response rate [ORR], median survival, symptom control, biomarker decreases, quality of life) while minimizing adverse effects (i.e., toxicity) in patients with incurable gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumours (NETs)?</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Internal Review</span></strong></p>
<p>For the guideline document to be approved, 75% of the content experts who comprise the Guideline Development Group (GDG) Expert Panel must cast a vote indicating whether or not they approve the document, or abstain from voting for a specified reason, and of those that vote, 75% must approve the document. In addition, the Program in Evidence-based Care (PEBC) Report Approval Panel (RAP), a three-person panel with methodology expertise, must unanimously approve the document. The Expert Panel and RAP members may specify that approval is conditional, and that changes to the document are required. If substantial changes are subsequently made to the recommendations during external review, then the revised draft must be resubmitted for approval by RAP and the GDG Expert Panel.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">External Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Feedback on the approved draft guideline is obtained from content experts and the target users through two processes. Through the Targeted Peer Review, several individuals with content expertise are identified by the GDG and asked to review and provide feedback on the guideline document. Through Professional Consultation, relevant care providers and other potential users of the guideline are contacted and asked to provide feedback on the guideline recommendations through a brief online survey. This consultation is intended to facilitate the dissemination of the final guidance report to Ontario practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patient- and Caregiver-Specific Consultation Group</span></strong></p>
<p>Four patients/survivors/caregivers participated as Consultation Group members. They reviewed the draft recommendations and provided feedback on its comprehensibility, appropriateness, and feasibility to the Working Group's Health Research Methodologist. The Health Research Methodologist relayed the feedback to the Working Group for consideration.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The desirable effect of targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib (i.e., increased progression-free survival [PFS]) on incurable gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) is considerable, while the undesirable effects (i.e., adverse events) are acceptable for targeted therapy. </li>
    <li>The desirable effect (i.e., increased PFS) on non-pancreatic NETs is large for both everolimus and octreotide, while the undesirable effects (i.e., adverse events) are small. The Working Group believes the desirable effect is large relative to the undesirable effect. </li>

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>The Working Group considered these recommendations to be the best possible recommendations given the currently available data and their feasibility of implementation. Research has shown that patients in rural settings have poorer outcomes and standardizing care would reduce this inequity. These recommendations would validate and align with what providers are currently implementing. Funding of drugs for neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) must take into account the difficulty in conducting trials with homogeneous populations in this disease and the need to often have heterogeneous populations in order to feasibly assess new systemic therapies. Due to the limited number of cases, funding bodies must recognize that data obtained in the assessment of systemic therapy for NETs are unlikely to be the same level of quality as in other cancers. Accordingly, treatment options that have a biological rationale, such as the use of targeted therapy in the second-line treatment of pancreatic NETs (pNETs), should be considered. The Working Group believed the outcomes valued in this guideline would align with patient values and that patients would view these recommendations as acceptable.</p></div>
