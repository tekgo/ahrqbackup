Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>A&ndash;C</strong>) and strength of recommendations (strong [grade <strong>1</strong>], weak [grade <strong>2</strong>]) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic Techniques</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It is recommended that the diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) be based primarily on established clinical criteria (modified Seattle or Baltimore criteria) (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Ultrasound imaging may be helpful in the exclusion of other disorders in patients with suspected VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>It is recommended that liver biopsy be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) is unclear and there is a need to exclude other diagnoses (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>It is recommended that liver biopsies are undertaken using the transjugular approach in order to reduce the risks associated with the procedure (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>It is suggested that the role of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels remains an area for further research but that these levels do not form part of the routine diagnostic work-up for VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) at present (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prevention of VOD</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It is recommended that patients are assessed for risk factors for VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) and that these risk factors are addressed prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Defibrotide is recommended at a dose of 6.25 milligrams/kg intravenously 4 times daily for the prevention of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) in children undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation with the following risk factors: pre-existing hepatic disease, second myeloablative transplant, allogeneic transplant for leukaemia beyond second relapse, conditioning with busulfan containing regimens, prior treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin, diagnosis of primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, adrenoleukodystrophy or osteopetrosis (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Defibrotide is suggested at a dose of 6.25 milligrams/kg intravenously 4 times daily for the prevention of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) in adults undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation with the following risk factors: pre-existing hepatic disease, second myeloablative transplant, allogeneic transplant for leukaemia beyond second relapse, conditioning with busulfan containing regimens, prior treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin, diagnosis of primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, adrenoleukodystrophy or osteopetrosis (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Prostaglandin E1 is not recommended in the prophylaxis of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) due to lack of efficacy and toxicity (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Pentoxifylline is not recommended in the prophylaxis of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) due to lack of efficacy (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Ursodeoxycholic acid is suggested for use in the prophylaxis of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Heparin (unfractionated and low molecular weight) is not suggested for use in the prophylaxis of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) due to the risk of increased toxicity (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Anti-thrombin is not suggested for the prophylaxis of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) due to lack of efficacy (<strong>2B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment of VOD</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Defibrotide is recommended in the treatment of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) in adults and children (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is not recommended for use in the treatment of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) due to the associated risk of haemorrhage (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>N-acetylcysteine is not routinely recommended for use in the treatment of VOD due to lack of efficacy (<strong>1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Methylprednisolone may be considered for use in the treatment of VOD with the appropriate caveats of caution regarding infection (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Judicious clinical care particularly in the management of fluid balance is recommended in the management of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Early discussion with critical care specialists and a specialist hepatology unit is recommended in the management of VOD (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) and other treatment options including transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or hepatic transplantation may be considered (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence is graded as high (A), moderate (B) or low (C). To put this in context it is useful to consider the uncertainty of knowledge and whether further research could change what is known or is certain.</p>
<p><strong>(A) High</strong> Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect. Current evidence derived from randomised clinical trials without important limitations.</p>
<p><strong>(B) Moderate</strong> Further research may well have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Current evidence derived from randomised clinical trials with important limitations (e.g., inconsistent results, imprecision &ndash; wide confidence intervals or methodological flaws &ndash; e.g., lack of blinding, large losses to follow up, failure to adhere to intention to treat analysis), or very strong evidence from observational studies or case series (e.g., large or very large and consistent estimates of the magnitude of a treatment effect or demonstration of a dose-response gradient).</p>
<p><strong>(C) Low</strong> Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Current evidence from observational studies, case series or just opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong (grade 1)</strong>: Strong recommendations (grade 1) are made when there is confidence that the benefits do or do not outweigh harm and burden. Grade 1 recommendations can be applied uniformly to most patients. Regard as 'recommend'.</p>
<p><strong>Weak (grade 2)</strong>: Where the magnitude of benefit or not is less certain a weaker grade 2 recommendation is made. Grade 2 recommendations require judicious application to individual patients. Regard as 'suggest'.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>A joint working group established by the Haemato-oncology subgroup of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) and the British Society for Bone Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT) has reviewed the available literature and made recommendations for the diagnosis and management of veno-occlusive disease of the liver following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</p>
<p>The production of these guidelines involved the following steps:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Development of key recommendations based on randomised, controlled trial evidence. Due to the paucity of randomised studies some recommendations are based on literature review and a consensus of expert opinion. </li>
    <li>The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) nomenclature was used to assess the strength of recommendations. The GRADE criteria are specified in the BCSH guideline pack and the GRADE working group website. See the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field. Further information is available from the following websites:
