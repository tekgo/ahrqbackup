<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children younger than 18 years of age identified as having sickle cell disease (SCD) who had: (1) a pulse oximetry reading, (2) a complete blood count, and (3) a reticulocyte count performed within the same 7-day period as part of outpatient care during the measurement year. A higher proportion indicates better performance, as reflected by appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>This measure uses medical record data to calculate individual rates for three blood tests, as well as an overall rate that is a composite of the three individual rates: </p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>The percentage of children who had a pulse oximetry reading performed during the outpatient visit. </li>
    <li>The percentage of children who had a complete blood count performed within 7 days of the outpatient visit. </li>
    <li>The percentage of children who had a reticulocyte count performed within 7 days of the outpatient visit. </li>
</ol>
<p>The overall rate is the percentage of children who, during outpatient care, had a pulse oximetry reading, a complete blood count, and a reticulocyte count performed within the same 7-day period.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Approximately 2,000 infants are born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States each year, a condition that occurs predominantly in people of African and Hispanic descent. SCD is a chronic hematologic disorder, characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S. From infancy onward, the presence of this hemoglobin variant can lead to an array of serious medical conditions. Appropriate blood testing in children is crucial to establish baseline values to use as comparisons during acute illness and to detect abnormalities that presage possible illness. Clinical guidelines for SCD pediatric health maintenance recommend that blood tests should be obtained regularly throughout childhood. However, there are no existing quality measures for appropriate blood testing in children with SCD.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Prevalence and Incidence</em><br />
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States (U.S.) (Kavanagh et al., 2011). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (2002) estimates that 2,000 infants are born with SCD in the U.S. each year. SCD affects 70,000 to 100,000 children and adults in the U.S., predominantly those of African and Hispanic descent (Hassell, 2010). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Pathology and Severity</em><br />
Vaso-occlusion (the sudden blockage of a blood vessel caused by the sickle shape of abnormal blood cells) is responsible for most complications of SCD, including pain episodes, sepsis, stroke, acute chest syndrome, priapism, leg ulcers, osteonecrosis and renal insufficiency (Steinberg, 1999). In addition, SCD can have hemolytic and infectious complications that result in morbidity and mortality in children with the condition (Kavanagh et al., 2011). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Burden in Daily Life</em><br />
The effect of SCD on children and families is significant; severe pain episodes and hospitalizations restrict daily activities and reflect negatively on school attendance and performance, as well as on sleep and social activities (Lemanek, Ranalli, &amp; Lukens, 2009; Alvim et al., 2005). Although medical management of SCD continues to improve over time, 196 children in the United States died from SCD-related causes between 1999 and 2002 (Yanni et al., 2009). </p>
<p><em>Sickle Cell Disease Cost</em><br />
In a study of health care utilization among low income children with SCD between 2004 and 2007, 27% of these children required inpatient hospitalization and 39% used emergency care during a year. Of these children, 63% averaged one well-child visit per year and 10% had at least one outpatient visit with a specialist (Raphael et al., 2009). Patients with SCD use many parts of the health care system, incurring significant costs. In 2009, mean hospital charges for children with SCD and a hospital stay were $23,000 for children with private insurance and $18,200 for children enrolled in Medicaid (HCUPnet, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, 2012). Kauf et al. (2009) estimate the lifetime cost of health care per patient with SCD to be approximately $460,000.</p>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability</strong><br />
<em>Data and Methods</em>. The testing data consisted of an audit of medical records from the three largest centers serving sickle cell disease (SCD) patients in Michigan during 2012: Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM, Detroit), Hurley Medical Center (Hurley, Flint), and the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS, Ann Arbor). Combined, these sites treat the majority of children with SCD in Michigan. Medical records for all children with SCD meeting the measure specification criteria during the measurement year were abstracted at each site. Abstracting was conducted in two phases; during Phase 1, 435 records were abstracted among the three sites. In Phase 2, an additional 237 cases were abstracted at one site. In total, 672 unique records were reviewed for children with SCD to test this measure.</p>
<p>Reliability of medical record data was determined through re-abstraction of patient record data to calculate the inter-rater reliability (IRR) between abstractors. Broadly, IRR is the extent to which the abstracted information is collected in a consistent manner (Keyton et al., 2004). Low IRR may be a sign of poorly executed abstraction procedures, such as ambiguous wording in the data collection tool, inadequate abstractor training, or abstractor fatigue. For this measure, the medical record data collected by two nurse abstractors were compared.</p>
<p>Measuring IRR at the beginning of the abstraction is imperative to identify any misinterpretations early on. It is also important to assess IRR throughout the abstraction process to ensure that the collected data maintain high reliability standards. Therefore, the IRR was evaluated during Phase 1 at each site to address any reliability issues before beginning data abstraction at the next site.</p>
<p>IRR was determined by calculating both percent agreement and Kappa statistics. While abstraction was still being conducted at each site, IRR assessments were conducted for 5% of the total set of unique patient records that were abstracted during Phase 1 of data collection. Two abstractors reviewed the same medical records; findings from these abstractions were then compared, and a list of discrepancies was created.</p>
<p>Three separate IRR meetings were conducted, all of which included a review of multiple SCD measures that were being evaluated. Because of eligibility criteria, not all patients were eligible for all measures. Therefore, records for IRR were not chosen completely at random; rather, records were selected to maximize the number of measures assessed for IRR at each site.</p>
<p><em>Results</em>. For this measure, 22 of 435 unique patient records (5%) from Phase 1 of the abstraction process were assessed for IRR across the three testing sites.</p>
<p>Table 6 of the original measure documentation shows the percent agreement and Kappa statistic for each numerator of this measure for each site and across all sites. The agreement for each numerator is 100% and the Kappa is 1.00, indicating a perfect IRR level was achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><br />
<em>Face Validity</em>. The face validity of this measure was established by a national panel of experts and advocates for families of children with SCD convened by the Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC). The Q-METRIC expert panel included nationally recognized experts in SCD, representing hematology, pediatrics, and SCD family advocacy. In addition, measure validity was considered by experts in state Medicaid program operations, health plan quality measurement, health informatics, and health care quality measurement. In total, the Q-METRIC SCD panel included 14 experts, providing a comprehensive perspective on SCD management and the measurement of quality metrics for states and health plans. </p>
<p>The Q-METRIC expert panel concluded that this measure has a high degree of face validity through a detailed review of concepts and metrics considered to be essential to effective SCD management and treatment. Concepts and draft measures were rated by this group for their relative importance. This measure was highly rated, receiving an average score of 8.0 (with 9 as the highest possible score).</p>
<p><em>Validity of Abstracted Data</em>. This measure was tested using medical record data, which is considered the gold standard for clinical information; our findings indicate that these data have a high degree of face validity and reliability. This measure was tested among a total of 500 children younger than 18 years of age with SCD (Table 7 of the original measure documentation). Overall, appropriate blood testing was conducted on 89% of children with SCD (range: 52% to 97%). Pulse oximetry was conducted on 93% of children with SCD seen in outpatient clinics (range among the three hospitals was: 65% to 99%). Similarly, a complete blood count was conducted within 7 days of the outpatient visit for 90% of children (range: 55% to 98%); a reticulocyte count was conducted within 7 days of the outpatient visit for 89% of children (range: 55% to 97%).</p></div>
