Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the risk-adjusted standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for dialysis facility patients. This measure is calculated as a ratio, but can also be expressed as a rate.</p>
<p>The SMR is designed to reflect the number of deaths for the patients at a facility, relative to the number of deaths that would be expected based on overall national rates and the characteristics of the patients at that facility. Specifically, the SMR is calculated as the ratio of two numbers; the numerator ("observed") is the actual number of deaths, excluding deaths due to street drugs and accidents unrelated to treatment, over a specified time period. The denominator ("expected") is the number of deaths that would be expected if patients at that facility died at the national rate for patients with similar characteristics, over the same time period.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>United States (U.S.) dialysis patients are much more likely to die than age-matched individuals without end stage renal disease (ESRD). The excess mortality associated with ESRD patients on dialysis is influenced by dialysis facility practices, and is one of several important health outcomes used by providers, health consumers, and insurers to evaluate the quality of care provided in dialysis facilities.</p>
<p><em>Epidemiological</em></p>
<p>At the end of 2013, there were 661,648 patients being dialyzed of which 117,162 were new (incident) ESRD patients (U.S. Renal Data System, 2015). ESRD mortality in the U.S. was 33% higher than in Europe (Goodkin et al., 2004), suggesting that this improvement of this outcome is possible. The components of unexplained or unexpected mortality that are actionable and associated with treatment and overall management of ESRD and other conditions are important to identify. </p>
<p>There is substantial evidence on the association between dialysis facility care practices, intermediate outcomes and mortality. For example, these include practices related to adequate dialysis, volume control, and appropriate management of mineral and bone disorder. Port et al. (2002) reported that dose of dialysis and body mass index (BMI) were both associated with mortality among hemodialysis patients. Flythe, Curhan, and Brunelli (2013) report that high ultrafiltration rates have been shown in several studies to be independently associated with increased risk of mortality. Rivara et al. (2015) found that high concentrations of serum calcium and phosphorus were associated with increased mortality.</p>
<p><em>Financial</em></p>
<p>Inefficient and inappropriate management of all aspects of patient ESRD care carries a high costs for both providers and payers. In 2013, total Medicare costs for the ESRD program were $30.9 billion (a 1.6% increase from 2012) (U.S. Renal Data System, 2015).</p>
<p><em>Policy</em></p>
<p>This measure has been in use in the Dialysis Facility Reports since 1995 and on the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/dialysisfacilitycompare/" title="Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) Web site" target="_blank">Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) Web site</a> since 2001, when the Balanced Budget Act (1997) required a system to measure and report the quality of dialysis services under Medicare.</p>
<p>The Dialysis Facility Reports are used by the dialysis facilities and ESRD Networks for quality improvement, and by ESRD state surveyors for monitoring and surveillance. The standardized mortality ratio for dialysis facilities (SMR) in particular is used by ESRD state surveyors in conjunction with other standard criteria for prioritizing and selecting facilities to survey. This patient survival classification measure is reported publicly on the DFC Web site to assist patients in selecting dialysis facilities.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The reliability of the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was assessed using data among end stage renal disease (ESRD) dialysis patients during 2010-2013. If the measure were a simple average across individuals in the facility, the usual approach for determining measure reliability would be a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The inter-unit reliability (IUR) measures the proportion of the total variation of a measure that is attributable to the between-facility variation. The SMR, however, is not a simple average and we instead estimate the IUR using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. A small IUR (near 0) reveals that most of the variation of the measures between facilities is driven by random noise, indicating the measure would not be a good characterization of the differences among facilities, whereas a large IUR (near 1) indicates that most of the variation between facilities is due to the real difference between facilities.</p>
<p>The SMR calculation only included facilities with at least 3 expected deaths for each year.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>See Table 1 and Table 2 in the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>Overall, the developer found that IURs for the one-year SMR have a range of 0.26-0.32 across the years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, which indicates that about thirty percent of the variation in the one-year SMR can be attributed to the between-facility differences and about seventy percent to within-facility variation. This value of IUR indicates a relatively low degree of reliability. When stratified by facility size, the developer finds that, as expected, larger facilities have greater IUR.</p>
<p>Reliability improved when four-year data were used. Overall, the developer found that IUR for the four-year SMR for 2010-2013 is 0.59 which indicates that about sixty percent of the variation in the four-year SMR can be attributed to the between-facility differences (signal) and about forty percent to within-facility variation (noise). This value of IUR indicates a moderate degree of reliability. When stratified by facility size, the developer finds that, as expected, larger facilities have greater IUR.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Measure validity is demonstrated by the relationship of the SMR to other quality of care indicators, including the standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR)&mdash;admissions, the standardized readmission ratio (SRR), the standardized transfusion ratio (STrR), percent of patients dialyzing with a fistula, percent of patients dialyzing with a catheter, and percent of patients with Kt/V greater than or equal to 1.2. Spearman's rho is reported for all variables. Because the correlations were approximately the same for the four years 2010-2013, we are reporting only the 2013 correlations.</p>
<p>The measure is also maintained on face validity. It was reviewed by a technical expert panel (TEP) in 2006 for potential implementation on Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC). The general consensus was the SMR captured meaningful information on survival that DFC users could use to assess facility quality. In 2015, a TEP was held specifically to consider prevalent comorbidity adjustments for inclusion in the measure. The TEP's recommendations are reflected in the risk adjustment methodology.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>SHR&mdash;admissions: rho = 0.20, p less than .0001 </li>
    <li>SRR&mdash;readmissions: rho = 0.10, p less than .0001 </li>
    <li>STrR: rho = 0.21, p less than .0001 </li>
    <li>Arteriovenous (AV) fistula: rho = -0.11, p less than .0001 </li>
    <li>Catheter: rho = 0.13, p less than .0001 </li>
    <li>Hemodialysis patients with Kt/V greater than or equal to 1.2: rho = -0.04, p less than .0001 </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>As expected, the SMR is positively correlated with the SHR&mdash;admissions (rho = 0.20, p less than 0.0001), SRR&mdash;readmissions (rho = 0.10, p less than 0.0001), and the STrR (rho = 0.21, p less than 0.0001); higher standardized mortality rates in facilities are associated with higher standardized hospitalization rates, higher standardized readmissions rates and higher standardized transfusion rates. The SMR is negatively correlated with percent of patients in the facility with AV fistula (rho = -0.11, p less than 0.0001); lower standardized mortality rates are associated with higher rates of AV fistula use. On the other hand, the SMR is positively correlated with catheter use (rho = 0.13, p less than 0.0001 ), indicating that higher values of SMR are associated with increased use of catheters. The SMR is also found to be negatively correlated (rho = -0.04, p less than 0.0001) with the percent of hemodialysis patients with Kt/V greater than or equal to 1.2, again in the direction expected. Lower SMRs are associated with a higher percentage of patients receiving adequate dialysis dose.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Inclusions</strong><br />
Number of deaths that would be expected among eligible dialysis patients at the facility during the time period, given the national average mortality rate and the patient mix at the facility. The expected deaths are identified using all patient records at the facility meeting inclusion criteria. The number of days at risk in each of these patient records is used to calculate the expected number of deaths for that patient record.</p>
<p>As patients can receive dialysis treatment at more than one facility in a given year, we assign each patient day to a facility (or no facility, in some cases) based on a set of conventions.</p>
<p>Since a patient's follow-up in the database can be incomplete during the first 90 days of end stage renal disease (ESRD) therapy, the developer only includes a patient's follow-up into the tabulations after that patient has received chronic renal replacement therapy for at least 90 days. Thus, hospitalizations, mortality and survival during the first 90 days of ESRD do not enter into the calculations. This minimum 90-day period also assures that most patients are eligible for Medicare, either as their primary or secondary insurer. It also excludes from analysis patients who die or recover renal function during the first 90 days of ESRD.</p>
<p>In order to exclude patients who only received temporary dialysis therapy, the developer assigns patients to a facility only after they have been on dialysis there for the past 60 days. This 60 day period is used both for patients who started dialysis for the first time and for those who returned to dialysis after a transplant. That is, deaths and survival during the first 60 days of dialysis at a facility do not affect the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of that facility.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) is based on expected mortality calculated from a Cox model. The model used is fit in two stages. The stage 1 model is a Cox model stratified by facility and adjusted for patient age, race, ethnicity, sex, diabetes, duration of end stage renal disease (ESRD), nursing home status from previous year, patient comorbidities at incidence, calendar year and body mass index (BMI) at incidence. This model allows the baseline survival probabilities to vary between strata (facilities), and assumes that the regression coefficients are the same across all strata. Stratification by facility at this stage avoids biases in estimating regression coefficients that can occur if the covariate distributions vary substantially across centers.
