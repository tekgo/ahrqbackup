Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of peritoneal dialysis patient-months with Kt/V greater than or equal to 1.7 Kt/V (dialytic + residual) during the four month study period. </p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evaluation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) adequacy every four months for adults is critical to ensure timely dose adjustment as needed, and adequate dialysis doses (Kt/V urea greater than 1.7 for adult patients and Kt/V urea greater than 1.8 for pediatric patients) have been linked to improved patient outcomes. Therefore, continued implementation of this measure is needed to ensure frequent adequacy measurement and adequate dialysis dosing. Studies have shown a Kt/V of 1.8/week or greater in adult PD patients was associated with better serum albumin levels (Paniagua et al., 2002) and improved survival (Lo et al., 2005). The Adequacy of Peritoneal Dialysis in Mexico (ADEMEX) study did not show clinical benefit with in weekly Kt/V doses exceeding 1.7/week in adult continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (Paniagua et al., 2002).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 Claims data to calculate the inter-unit reliability (IUR) for the overall 12 months to assess the reliability of this measure. The National Quality Forum (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based IUR was estimated using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. The developer notes that the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. Since this measure is not normally distributed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>For reliability the developer calculated the monthly and annual IUR across the 12 reporting months. As explained above, the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. IUR=0.910, which is high and suggests 91% of variation in the measure is attributed to between facility variation. The confidence interval is (0.904, 0.917). </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The IUR suggests this measure is reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Validity was assessed by calculating the Spearman correlation between this measure and the 2013 standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (NQF 0369) and standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR) (NQF 1463).</p>
<p>This measure is also being maintained on the basis of face validity. Use of small solute clearance (urea reduction ratio and more recently Kt/V) as a dialysis quality measure was initially developed and approved by clinical technical expert panels (TEPs) in 2006, 2010 (for pediatric hemodialysis [HD] and peritoneal dialysis [PD] adequacy), and 2013 which all agreed that this quality measure domain will improve is important in the assessment of the quality of care for dialysis patients. Achieving target Kt/V was finalized for the End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP) beginning with program year (PY) 2015, and has been reported on Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC) since January 2013. </p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>The Spearman correlation between this measure and the 2013 SMR as measured by the NQF-endorsed SMR (NQF 0369) for the same facility is -0.008 (p-value=0.7749). The Spearman correlation between this measure and the 2013 SHR as measured by the 2013 SHR (NQF 1463) is -0.139 (p-value less than 0.0001). </p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The Spearman correlation estimates indicate higher facility level percentages of patients at the facility that achieve the Kt/V target is associated lower standardized hospitalization, respectively, although the magnitude of the association is low. A very weak association between facility level percentages of patients achieving the Kt/V target and lower standardized mortality was observed and in the expected direction, however the correlation coefficient was not statistically significant. </p></div>
