Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of pediatric peritoneal dialysis patient-months with Kt/V greater than or equal to 1.8 Kt/V (dialytic + residual) during the six month study period.</p></div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Dialysis dose is an intermediate clinical outcome. The dose of dialysis is used to estimate the ability of peritoneal dialysis (PD) to clear the blood of accumulated toxins. In the adult population, clinical practice guidelines have established an association between dose of hemodialysis in terms of small solute removal and clinical outcomes. Studies have shown a Kt/V of 1.8/week or greater in adult PD patients was associated with better serum albumin levels (Paniagua et al., 2002) and improved survival (Lo et al., 2005).</p>
<p>Pediatric PD adequacy targets should be no lower than existing adult PD adequacy targets since generally, pediatric patients' greater metabolic demands require higher adequacy targets in terms of small solute clearance. No equivalent large scale clinical trials have been conducted in the pediatric PD population but smaller scale observational studies support the association between delivered PD dose and patient outcomes including the potential for improved growth (Rees, Feather, &amp; Shroff, 2008).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&mdash;December 2013 claims data to calculate the inter-unit reliability (IUR) for the overall 12 months to assess the reliability of this measure. The National Quality Form (NQF)-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based IUR was estimated using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. The developer notes that the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. Since this measure is not normally distributed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>For reliability the developer calculated the monthly and annual IUR across the 12 reporting months. As explained above, the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. IUR=0.961 with the confidence interval being (0.937, 0.979), which is high and suggests 96% of variation in the measure is attributed to between facility variation.</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The IUR suggest this measure is reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Assessment based on face validity by the 2013 peritoneal dialysis (PD) pediatric technical expert panel (TEP).</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>This measure is being maintained on the basis of face validity. Use of small solute clearance (urea reduction ratio and more recently Kt/V) as a dialysis quality measure was initially developed and approved by a clinical TEP in 2013 which agreed that this quality measure domain will improve is important in the assessment of the quality of care for pediatric dialysis patients. Achieving target Kt/V for pediatric PD patients was finalized for the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program (QIP) beginning with program year (PY) 2018.</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>This measure was established on the basis of face validity. Clinical TEP members agreed that this measure will improve quality of care for pediatric PD patients.</p></div>
