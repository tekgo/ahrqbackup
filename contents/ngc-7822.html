Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 1: Are there effective nonpharmacologic treatments for muscle cramps?</strong></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>. Data are insufficient to draw any conclusion on the efficacy of calf stretching in reducing the frequency of muscle cramps. </li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation</strong>. None (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 2: Is quinine effective in the treatment of muscle cramps?</strong></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>. On the basis of data from 2 Class I studies, quinine derivatives are effective in reducing the frequency of muscle cramps, although the magnitude of benefit is small. Moreover, these agents are associated with serious though uncommon side effects. </li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation</strong>. Although likely effective (<strong>Level A</strong>), the use of quinine derivatives for treatment of muscle cramps should be avoided for routine treatment of cramps. These agents should only be considered when cramps are very disabling, no other agents relieve symptoms, and there is careful monitoring of side effects. They should only be used after informing the patient of the potentially serious side effects. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3: Are there any other pharmacologic treatments effective for the treatment of muscle cramps?</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>. On the basis of single Class II studies, naftidrofuryl, vitamin B complex, and diltiazem are possibly effective in the treatment of muscle cramps. Naftidrofuryl is currently not available in the United States. Data regarding the use of magnesium preparations (2 Class II studies) and gabapentin (1 study in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS]) show that these agents are probably not effective in the treatment of muscle cramps. </li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation</strong>. Naftidrofuryl, diltiazem, and vitamin B complex may be considered for the treatment of muscle cramps (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Studies of Therapeutic Intervention</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A randomized, controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest with masked or objective outcome assessment, in a representative population. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences. The following are also required:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Concealed allocation </li>
    <li>Primary outcome(s) clearly defined </li>
    <li>Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined </li>
    <li>Adequate accounting for drop-outs (with at least 80% of enrolled subjects completing the study) and cross-overs with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias </li>
    <li>For non-inferiority or equivalence trials claiming to prove efficacy for one or both drugs, the following are also required*:
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>The authors explicitly state the clinically meaningful difference to be excluded by defining the threshold for equivalence or non-inferiority. </li>
        <li>The standard treatment used in the study is substantially similar to that used in previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. (e.g., for a drug, the mode of administration, dose and dosage adjustments are similar to those previously shown to be effective). </li>
        <li>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection and the outcomes of patients on the standard treatment are comparable to those of previous studies establishing efficacy of the standard treatment. </li>
        <li>The interpretation of the results of the study is based upon a per protocol analysis that takes into account dropouts or crossovers. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A randomized controlled clinical trial of the intervention of interest in a representative population with masked or objective outcome assessment that lacks one criteria a&ndash;e above or a prospective matched cohort study with masked or objective outcome assessment in a representative population that meets b&ndash;e above. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement.**</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria including consensus or expert opinion.</p>
<p class="Note">*Note that numbers 1-3 in Class Ie are required for Class II in equivalence trials. If any one of the three is missing, the class is automatically downgraded to Class III.</p>
<p class="Note">**Objective outcome measurement: an outcome measure that is unlikely to be affected by an observer's (patient, treating physician, investigator) expectation or bias (e.g., blood tests, administrative outcome data).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The main search strategy was a comprehensive search of MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1950 to May 31, 2008, using the search term "muscle cramp" limited to keywords "therapy," "drug therapy," and "prevention and control," which yielded 558 results in 4 languages (including French, German, Spanish, and English). Additional articles were identified by cross referencing bibliographies from meta-analyses, review articles, and case reports identified in the initial search, which yielded 5 additional articles. "Muscle cramp" was defined as a sustained, generally painful, involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle group. "Cramps" alone was not used as a search term due to excessive articles on gynecologic and gastrointestinal cramps.</p>
<p>The abstracts and titles from the 563 articles identified were reviewed, and a study was included if it was a prospective clinical trial with effect on muscle cramps as a primary or secondary outcome. Exclusion criteria were 1) review articles, 2) meta-analyses, 3) case reports or case series that did not involve a treatment, 4) phenomena not consistent with muscle cramps, such as muscle spasms, dystonia, or muscle pains, 5) pregnancy-induced cramps, 6) medical conditions such as hemodialysis and cirrhosis, and 7) cramps due to extreme physiologic stress such as excessive exercise, heat, or dehydration. Cramps secondary to medical conditions were excluded from this analysis because the mechanisms underlying the formation of cramps and often the treatment directed to correct them are distinct from the routine treatment of muscle cramps, and most treatment trials assessing idiopathic cramps also excluded these conditions. Muscle cramps due to myopathies were also excluded due to the distinct underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>A total of 50 potential studies were identified for full review. Full review of the articles led to further exclusion of 26 articles that were review articles, letters, or repeat publications of the same clinical trials. The remaining 24 articles were chosen for inclusion in the final review, including one article dealing with nonpharmacologic therapy, 5 open-label pharmacologic trials, and 18 randomized pharmacologic trials.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The Medline and Cochrane databases were searched from 2010 February 23 to 2013 July 13, using the following terms: "muscle cramp" limited to keywords "therapy," "drug therapy," and "prevention and control." Exclusion criteria were 1) review articles, 2) meta-analyses, 3) case reports or case series that did not involve a treatment, 4) phenomena not consistent with muscle cramps, such as muscle spasms, dystonia, or muscle pains, 5) pregnancy-induced cramps, 6) medical conditions such as hemodialysis and cirrhosis, and 7) cramps due to extreme physiologic stress such as excessive exercise, heat, or dehydration. A study was included if it was a prospective clinical trial with effect on muscle cramps as a primary or secondary outcome.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The Medline database was searched from January 2013 to July 2016 using the following search terms: (muscle cramps) AND treatment. Inclusion criteria were RCTs, humans only, relevant to clinical questions; exclusion criteria used to screen search results were the same as described in the 2010 published guideline.</p></div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least three AAN committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology&reg; peer reviewers and representatives from related fields. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.aan.com" title="AAN Web site">www.aan.com</a>.</p></div>
