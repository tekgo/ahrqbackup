    <li>Additional testing to quantitate a patient's comorbid status and develop a risk profile is recommended. These tests may include for particularly high-risk patients CT of the chest if not already done, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), 24-hour Holter monitoring, noninvasive carotid screening, brain imaging, echocardiography, neurocognitive testing, and assessment of degree of frailty.

    <li>Patients with genetically associated aortic diseases, including those with a bicuspid aortic valve, should undergo surgery at diameters exceeding 5.0 cm unless a family history of aortic dissection is present, then it is acceptable to lower the threshold to 4.5 cm. Alternatively, patients with a maximal ascending aortic area (pi r<sup>2</sup>, cm<sup>2</sup>) to height in meters ratio exceeding 10 should be considered for surgery (Hiratzka et al., 2010).

    <li>For patients undergoing cardiac surgery other than for aortic indications, aortic repair is recommended when diameter exceeds 4.5 cm (Hiratzka et al., 2010). (<strong>Level of evidence B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Aortic diameters should be measured at right angles to the axis of flow, which requires the use of three dimensional reconstructive software. The maximal diameters at each segment of the aorta should be reported. Echocardiography measures internal diameters while CT and MRI measures external diameters, and thus some allowance should be made for echocardiographic measurements being smaller. (<strong>Level of evidence C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Separate valve and ascending aortic replacement are recommended for patients without significant aortic root dilation, for elderly patients, and for young patients with minimal dilation in whom a biological valve is being inserted or a bicuspid valve is being repaired (Hiratzka et al., 2010). (<strong>Level of evidence B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Patients with Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and root dilation should undergo excision of the sinuses in combination with a modified David valve reimplantation procedure if technically feasible or insertion of a valve graft conduit (Hiratzka et al., 2010). (<strong>Level of evidence B</strong>) </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>For this systematic review on the Aortic Valve and Ascending Aorta, specific search terms were identified and targeted searches were run in PubMed/MEDLINE in December 2011. The inclusion criteria for the literature search were limited to English language publications, and adult human subjects. The task force augmented the computerized literature search by manually reviewing the reference lists of identified studies and relevant reviews known to the expert committee. In addition, the writing group identified articles from personal files and undertook their own searches for assigned topics. The terms used included aorta, aortic valve, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, bicuspid aortic valve, transcatheter valve, and guidelines.</p></div>

Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>The guidelines rely primarily on nonrandomized trials, observational studies, registries, propensity analyses, and consensus statements of experts. When needed, the guidelines draw heavily from the previously published 2010 ACCF/AHA/AATS/ACR/ASA/SCA/SCAI/SIR/STS/SVM guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with thoracic aortic disease.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate evaluation and management of aortic valve and ascending aorta disease </li>
    <li>Better understanding of the pros and cons of current surgical treatment options </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Risks of procedures include risk of systemic emboli necessitating anticoagulation of a thrombogenic heart valve replacement device with its attendant risks of hemorrhage, catastrophic prosthesis failure, prosthetic valve endocarditis, hemolysis from periprosthetic regurgitation, stroke, paraplegia, and death early after a procedure. </li>
    <li>Exercise testing should not be performed in symptomatic patients owing to a high risk of complications. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the "Cons" sections of the original guideline document for harms and/or disadvantages of specific interventions.</p>

<h2>Contraindications

<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Temporary contraindications to valve replacement include sepsis, severe debilitation, acute neurological event, coagulopathy, congestive heart failure, and ventilator dependence, etc. </li>
    <li>Anatomic factors such as true porcelain aorta, which would be a contraindication to conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR), are amenable to a transapical approach. </li>
    <li>Contraindications for the transapical procedure include calcification of the pericardium or left ventricular (LV) apex, patch repair of the apex secondary to an aneurysmectomy, LV apex thrombus, or severe respiratory insufficiency that would be exacerbated by a thoracotomy. Additionally, certain anatomic abnormalities that preclude accessing the LV apex, such as extreme rotation of the heart or previous pneumonectomy resulting in dislocation of the heart into either the right or left chest, rule out a transapical approach. </li>
    <li>Contraindications for the direct aortic procedure include atheroma or calcification of the ascending aorta that the surgeon believes precludes placement and safe closure of the aorta. Additionally, certain factors may preclude a direct aortic approach such as anatomic displacement of the aorta (pneumonectomy). </li>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines are intended to assist physicians and other health care providers in clinical decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the diagnosis, management, or prevention of specific diseases or conditions. These guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the same results. Moreover, these guidelines are subject to change over time, without notice. The ultimate judgment regarding the care of a particular patient must be made by the physician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient. </li>
    <li>These guidelines have summarized the current knowledge in the treatment of aortic valve and aortic disease. Clearly there are many questions and these can only partially be answered from incomplete data sets. Undoubtedly, newer iterations will update these guidelines. The choice of the best procedure or valve for patients is dependent on many factors and no procedure or device is ideal. Ultimately it is up to the patient, the cardiologist, and surgeon to reach a decision on appropriate treatment. </li>
