<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patient Education</span></strong></p>
<p>Discuss the diagnosis and treatment options.</p>
<p>Discuss reasonable expectations for the resolution of symptoms, and return to work or other activities. Inform the patient that it is not uncommon for patients who recover from the initial episode to have another episode, but improvement is to be expected. Reassure the patient of the anticipated recovery or improvement.</p>
<p>Instruct the patient in appropriate self-guided care. This may include discussion of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Limited bed rest with gradual return to normal activities </li>
    <li>Activities or positions to limit or avoid </li>
    <li>Continuing activities within limits permitted by pain or other symptoms </li>

    <li>Ergonomic recommendation/counseling </li>
    <li>Gentle stretching </li>
    <li>Ice/heat </li>
    <li>Instruction in exercises </li>
</ul>
<p>Discuss patient's use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications or need for prescriptive medication.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Manual Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Manual adjustive manipulation procedures and other manual therapies including manipulation utilizing instrumentation. The effect is to normalize joint mobility and nerve function in addition to pain reduction, with frequent compensatory changes in other areas. Secondary changes in peripheral neurological function may include relief from somatic pain syndromes, nerve compression syndromes, functional disorders and anatomical pain syndromes.</p>
<p>The primary focus of manual therapy is to address functional abnormalities of joints, including fixation, hypermobility or hypomobility of the joint. Contributing factors of functional abnormalities include muscular hypertonicity or weakness, ligamentous shortening or elongation and articular adhesions if not corrected. The mechanism for blockage of articular movement may involve mechanical joint locking, disc disorders and/or intra-articular jamming of various tissues, including synovial capsules.</p>
<p><strong>Complementary Procedures</strong></p>
<p>Complementary procedures are intended to normalize joint function, decrease muscle spasm, decrease pain, reduce edema or inflammation, improve muscle tone, increase joint mobility or stability, increase soft tissue flexibility, decrease pain, and maximize integrity of fibrotic repair.</p>
<p>Complementary procedures may include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Manual or mechanical traction </li>
    <li>Neuromuscular re-education </li>
    <li>Myofascial release </li>
    <li>Trigger point therapy </li>
    <li>Muscle stretch techniques </li>
    <li>Mobilization </li>
    <li>Use of supports, braces, splints, or orthotics </li>
</ul>
<p>Physical medicine modalities and procedures may be of benefit in conjunction with manipulation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phases of Care</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Active Care</strong></p>
<p>Active care includes methods of treatment requiring active involvement, participation and responsibility on the part of the patient. This may be supervised in office or the patient may be provided with instructions for self-care. Active care in each phase of treatment should begin when, in the treating physician's judgment, it is appropriate to do so. This would be based upon, among other things, the severity of the injury, the area of injury, the patient's age and/or other limiting factors.</p>
<p>Phases of active care include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Acute</em>: Temporarily limit or avoid specific activities known to increase or aggravate mechanical stress on the injured region. In order to avoid deconditioning, low stress aerobic and flexibility exercises can be instituted as soon as tolerated. </li>
    <li><em>Sub-acute</em>: Recommended exercise quotas that are gradually increased result in better outcomes. Endurance programs (walking/biking/swimming) can be initiated during this phase. </li>
    <li><em>Chronic</em>: Strengthening and stabilization exercises for the injured region can commence immediately. </li>
</ul>
<p>Gradual increase in time per session, amount, and intensity of exercises as the patient demonstrates improvement.</p>
<p>Reduce, modify, or discontinue exercise program if peripheralization (spread of symptoms) occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Management of Chronic Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Chronic pain syndrome is defined as persistent pain which lasts more than three months, which interferes with physiological or psychological function and which requires ongoing treatment. In general, chronic pain syndrome includes:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Musculoskeletal conditions </li>
    <li>Pre-existing and/or progressive degenerative conditions </li>
    <li>Failed back surgery syndrome </li>
    <li>Neurological disorders and psychological issues leading to drug dependence </li>
    <li>High levels of stress and anxiety </li>
    <li>Pre-existing or latent psychopathology </li>
</ul>
<p>The condition is not expected to completely resolve but treatment can be expected to result in some functional improvement and stabilization or slowing of progressive degenerative changes. Patients with chronic pain syndromes whose pain has become intractable in spite of initial care and secondary treatment may benefit from evaluation and treatment including spinal manipulative techniques, physical medicine, pain management and physical conditioning such as therapeutic and rehabilitative exercise to help promote functional recovery. Frequently, chronic pain syndrome patients require supportive care to maintain their therapeutic gains or clinical status.</p>
<p>For information on contraindication or modifications of spinal manipulation refer to the "Contraindications" field in this summary.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The databases that were used to collect the evidence were: PubMed, GOOGLE Scholar, EBSCOHost Databases, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and OVID.</p>
<p>The time frame of the literature searches was from 2009 through June 2012.</p>
<p>The literature search was limited to English literature and search parameters were kept non-specific to prevent unwanted exclusion. Literature was limited to human trials only. An attempt was made to include a wide variety of health care practitioners to incorporate various forms of assessment and treatment. This was done in an attempt to follow the continued trend of multidisciplinary care and the need to efficiently integrate various forms of service and treatment.</p>
<p>The specific search terms used were: "Musculoskeletal injuries" combined with: "Cervical spine", "Lumbar spine", "Spine", "Upper extremity", "Lower extremity", "Shoulder", "Hip", "Knee", "Elbow", "Hand", "Ankle", "Treatment", "Assessment", and "Chiropractic".</p></div>

Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Contraindication or Modifications of Spinal Manipulations</strong></p>
<p>Prior to manipulative techniques, the patient needs to be evaluated by a doctor trained and licensed to perform manipulative therapeutics, for any underlying conditions that, based on the doctor's experience and expertise, would modify or contradict the procedure.</p>
<p>Contraindication or modification of spinal manipulative procedures include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Severe sprain/strains: Due to severe instability. The patient should be referred for surgical evaluation, if indicated. Areas of adjacent fixation that are contributing to the instability may be manipulated. </li>
    <li>Rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis: Due to potential ligament rupture or instability (i.e., transverse ligament instability), forceful manipulation is contraindicated. Use of soft tissue and mobilization techniques with light manipulation may be appropriate. </li>
    <li>Serious vascular disease: History or evaluation of serious vascular disease, including, but not limited to, vertebral artery dissection, vertebral basilar insufficiency, aneurysm, stroke, use of blood thinning medications or clotting disorders. </li>
    <li>Musculoskeletal disorders: History or evaluation of some serious musculoskeletal conditions may require modification or contraindication of some manipulative techniques. These may include, but are not limited to, fracture of the involved area, severe arthritic disease or metabolic disease. </li>
