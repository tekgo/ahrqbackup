<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Assessment/Monitoring</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>It is recommended:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>That whole blood cytomegalovirus (CMV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) be used for monitoring (Lisboa et al., 2011 [4b (diagnosis)]), and </li>
        <li>That monitoring occur at specified intervals (see Table 2 in original guideline document) (Local Consensus, 2013 [5]). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It is recommended, to assure consistent results, that the same laboratory facility and assay be used for serial samples (Local Consensus, 2013 [5]; Pang et al., 2009 [5a (diagnostics)])
    <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: The laboratory facility at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) will be used for CCHMC patients.</p>
    <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Inconsistent test results may be the result of testing being performed:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>At different laboratory facilities </li>
        <li>Using different assays </li>
        <li>On a different specimen type (e.g., whole blood vs. plasma) (Lisboa et al., 2011 [4b (diagnosis)]) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Contributing factors may be:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Patient use of different laboratory facility due to geographic need or insurance </li>
        <li>The designated laboratory facility transitions to use a different assay </li>
        <li>Unreliable implementation processes (see the "Description of Implementation Strategy" field and Appendix 2 in the original guideline document) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Clinical Assessment</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>It is recommended that patients with any of the following clinical conditions be evaluated for CMV by examination, whole blood PCR and end-organ histopathology if indicated (Local Consensus, 2013 [5]; Kotton et al., 2013 [5a]):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Fever </li>
        <li>Hepatitis </li>

</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations for CMV disease prevention in solid organ transplant recipients are based on the organ transplanted and previously defined risk levels (see Table 2 in original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>Primary Strategy</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
    <li>It is recommended that <strong>targeted prophylaxis</strong> be the primary strategy for prevention of CMV disease at CCHMC (Local Consensus, 2013 [5]). See the definition for "targeted prophylaxis" on Page 1 of the original guideline document. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Risk Stratification</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
    <li>It is recommended that targeted prophylaxis be risk stratified based on donor/recipient (D/R) CMV serostatus (see Table 2 in the original guideline document) (Local Consensus, 2013 [5], Kotton et al., 2013 [5a]). </li>
    <li>It is recommended to assign infants &lt;12 months of age to the high risk category unless D-/R-, as serology in infants &lt;12 months of age may be confounded by maternal antibody (see Table 3 in the original guideline document) (Local Consensus, 2013 [5]; Kotton et al., 2013 [5a]). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Medications</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="7">
    <li>It is recommended to use age- and weight-based antiviral dosing (see Table 4 in the original guideline document) (Villeneuve et al., 2013 [3a (treatment)]; Launay et al., 2012 [3a (treatment)]; Pescovitz et al., 2010 [3a (treatment)]; Vaudry et al., 2009 [3a (treatment)]; Local Consensus, 2013 [5]). </li>
    <li>It is recommended that valganciclovir (VGCV) be dosed around a meal (Villeneuve et al., 2013 [3a (treatment)]; Pescovitz et al., 2010 [3a (treatment)]). </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>To select evidence for critical appraisal by the group for this guideline, the MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane databases were searched for dates of January 2007 to August 2013 to generate an unrefined, "combined evidence" database using a search strategy focused on answering clinical questions relevant to cytomegalovirus and solid organ transplantation and employing a combination of Boolean searching on human-indexed thesaurus terms (MeSH headings using an OVID MEDLINE interface) and "natural language" searching on words in the title, abstract, and indexing terms. The citations were reduced by: eliminating duplicates, review articles, and non-English articles. The resulting abstracts were reviewed to eliminate low quality and irrelevant citations. During the course of the guideline development, additional clinical questions were generated and subjected to the search process. January 2007 was the last date for which literature was reviewed for the previous version of this guideline. All previous citations were reviewed for appropriateness to this revision.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The process by which this guideline was developed is documented in the Guideline Development Process Manual (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field); relevant development materials are kept electronically.

<p>Recommendations have been formulated by a consensus process directed by best evidence, patient and family preference and clinical expertise. During formulation of these recommendations, the team members have remained cognizant of controversies and disagreements over the management of these patients. The team&nbsp;tried to resolve controversial issues by consensus where possible and, when not possible, to offer optional approaches to care in the form of information that includes best supporting evidence of efficacy for alternative choices.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Implementation Issues for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Monitoring Related to External Laboratory Facility Use</strong></p>
<p>Attempts to implement Recommendation #2 may encounter difficulties when use of external laboratory facilities cannot be avoided. Under such circumstances, a reliable process to document the following relevant details will enable appropriate interpretation of assay results.</p>
<p>Specifics to be documented for each specimen:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Laboratory facility </li>
    <li>Specimen type (whole blood or plasma) </li>
    <li>Unit of measure for results (copies/mL, IU/mL, etc.) </li>
    <li>Assay used (if available) </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, implementation of this interpretation requires reliable access to these details within the context of clinic flow.</p></div>
