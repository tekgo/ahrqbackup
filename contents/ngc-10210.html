Selected references in selected publications were also reviewed. The literature was limited for many vaccines and patient populations and primarily comprised case series evaluating vaccine immunogenicity and safety in particular populations of immunocompromised patients.

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Panel Composition</strong></p>
<p>The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee (SPGC) collaborated with partner organizations and convened a panel of 12 experts in vaccination of immunocompromised patients with a goal of devising recommendations for clinical practice. The panel represented diverse geographic areas, pediatric and adult practitioners, and a wide breadth of specialties (gastroenterology, immunology, infectious diseases, hematology and oncology, rheumatology, and stem cell and solid organ transplantation) and organizations (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]; American College of Rheumatology; North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition; American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP]; Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society; and European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation).</p>
<p><strong>Process Overview and Consensus Development Based on Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Panel subgroups reviewed the initial literature search, selected references, evaluated evidence, drafted recommendations, and summarized the evidence for each section. Published guidelines formed the basis for recommendations on vaccination of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), with modifications based on newer references and discussion among panel members.</p>
<p>Drafts were circulated among panel members for commentary and discussed on 14 occasions by teleconference or in-person meeting.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate vaccination of immunocompromised patients and their household contacts </li>
    <li>Prevention of vaccine-preventable infections </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The decision to administer or withhold a vaccine should be based on balancing the burden of the vaccine-preventable disease and risk of developing severe or life-threatening infection with the wild-type pathogen and the risks of adverse effects from vaccination. </li>
    <li>The risk of posttransplant disease from pretransplant administration of live vaccines such as varicella (VAR), measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), or zoster (ZOS) vaccines has not been completely defined. A waiting period of 4 weeks was chosen based, in part, on the outer range of risk for developing skin lesions postvaccination for most patients. </li>
    <li>MMR vaccine was safely administered to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children with &ge;15% CD4 T lymphocytes in &gt;1200 patients. However, some severe complications occurred in children with lower CD4 T-cell lymphocyte percentages or counts. </li>
    <li>Data are very limited on yellow fever vaccine in immunocompromised persons. Investigators recently studied the effect of yellow fever vaccine in 70 patients with rheumatic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and spondyloarthropathies who were treated with immunosuppressive drugs. Mild adverse effects (e.g., rash, myalgia, elevated hepatic transaminases) occurred in 22.5% of vaccinees, suggesting a reasonably safety profile. However, sample size was inadequate for detecting rare serious complications, and cases of yellow fever vaccine&ndash;associated viscerotropic disease have been reported in this population. Yellow fever vaccine has been safely administered to a limited number of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients and to more than 200 HIV-infected adults, the majority of whom had CD4 T-cell lymphocyte counts &gt;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. An increase in relapse of multiple sclerosis was noted in 7 yellow fever vaccine recipients. </li>
    <li>Administration of inactivated vaccines to HIV-infected persons appears safe as no increases in adverse effects or HIV-specific adverse effects have been recognized. However, data are not sufficient to comment on rare adverse effects. </li>
    <li>In the United States, diphtheria toxoid in combination with tetanus toxoid (DT) vaccine is not approved for persons aged &gt;6 years due to adverse effects. However, experience with adult HSCT recipients indicates a lower risk for adverse effects than in previously vaccinated immunocompetent adults, suggesting that the adverse effect profile of DT vaccine may be acceptable in this population. It has not yet been determined whether the immune response to tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid vaccine (Td) is equivalent to the response to DT vaccine. </li>

<h2>Contraindications
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is contraindicated for asplenic patients, immunocompromised patients, and those with sickle cell diseases. </li>
    <li>Live vaccines are generally contraindicated in immunodeficient patients because attenuation is relative. </li>
    <li>Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is contraindicated for patients with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) because paralytic poliomyelitis has occurred after vaccination. </li>
    <li>Varicella vaccine (VAR) is generally considered contraindicated for children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who are receiving 6-mercaptopurine. </li>
    <li>Live, attenuated, cold-adapted intranasal influenza vaccine is not administered to immunocompromised patients based on insufficient clinical data to support these judgments. </li>
    <li>Certain immunocompromised patients may have thrombocytopenia that may be a relative contraindication to an intramuscular injection. </li>
    <li>In general, live vaccines are contraindicated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons with low CD4 T-cell lymphocyte counts or percentages. </li>
    <li>Live viral vaccines are contraindicated during chemotherapy because of the risk of disseminated disease. </li>
    <li>Many molecular defects can result in defects of antiviral immunity, contraindicating the use of live viral vaccines. </li>
    <li>The use of bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccine is contraindicated in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients because it is a live bacterial vaccine with a potential risk of serious adverse effects. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tables 2-7 in the original guideline document provide additional information on contraindications in specific clinical contexts.</p>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. The guidelines are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. </li>
    <li>Data on safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy/effectiveness of vaccines for immunocompromised populations are limited. Prelicensure studies often exclude immunocompromised persons, and postlicensure studies examine small numbers of immunocompromised patients. These small numbers are problematic when assessing adverse effects. Furthermore, immune defects vary among and within categories of patients with immune deficiencies (e.g., degree of immune deficiency, nutritional status, immunosuppressive regimen), which may limit the generalizability of study findings. </li>
    <li>This guideline addresses vaccines routinely recommended on the basis of patient age, social or occupational history, increased risk of infection related to underlying disease or treatment of disease, and travel. Vaccines for bioterrorism are not addressed. Immunobiological agents administered for active vaccination are addressed; immune globulin preparations and monoclonal antibodies used for passive vaccination are not. This guideline focuses on vaccines available in the United States, which are often relevant to other areas. Informed consent prior to vaccination, including provision of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine information statement, documentation of the vaccination, communication about vaccination to the patient (parent) or to clinicians involved in the patient's care, and discussion of vaccination registries, is beyond the scope of this document. </li>

Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guidelines and Conflict of Interest</strong></p>
<p>All panel members complied with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) policy on conflict of interest, which requires disclosure of any financial or other interest that might be construed as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent conflict. They were provided IDSA's conflict-of-interest disclosure statement and asked to identify ties to companies that develop products that might be affected by promulgation of the guideline. Information was requested regarding employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, research funding, expert testimony, and membership on company advisory committees. The panel decided on a case-by-case basis whether conflict should limit member participation.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>
<p>The following list is a reflection of what has been reported to the IDSA. In order to provide thorough transparency, the IDSA requires full disclosure of all relationships, regardless of relevancy to the guideline topic. Evaluation of such relationships as potential conflicts of interest is determined by a review process that includes assessment by the Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee (SPGC) chair, the SPGC liaison to the development panel, the Board of Directors liaison to the SPGC, and, if necessary, the Conflict of Interest Task Force of the board. This assessment of disclosed relationships for possible conflict of interest is based on the relative weight of the financial relationship (i.e., monetary amount) and the relevance of the relationship (i.e., the degree to which an association might reasonably be interpreted by an independent observer as related to the topic or recommendation of consideration). The reader of these guidelines should be mindful of this when the list of disclosures is reviewed. R. A. has served as a subinvestigator on clinical trials funded by ViroPharma, Roche, and the CDC. A. B. has served as a subinvestigator on clinical trials funded by Abbott, UCB, and Merck; served as a consultant to Dyax, Cubist, and Nutricia; received speaking fees from Merck; and received a writing honorarium from Up-To-Date, Inc. E. G. D. has served as a consultant with GlaxoSmithKline and received a grant from Pfizer. I. K. has received research funding from Amino Up Chemical. H. K. has received funding from Pfizer for a clinical trial. M. L. has served as a consultant for Merck, MedImmune, and GlaxoSmithKline; has received honoraria and patent license from Merck; is on an adjudication committee for GlaxoSmithKline; and participates in research studies with Sanofi Pasteur, GlaxoSmithKline, and Merck. P. L. has served as a consultant to ViroPharma, Vical, Clinigen, Astellas Pharma, and Pfizer; served as an investigator for ViroPharma, Astellas Pharma, Pfizer, and Merck; and chaired a Data and Safety Monitoring Board for AiCuris. No conflicts: G. A., L. R., S. D., M. T., L. S., and E.W. All other authors report no potential conflicts.</p>
<p>All authors have submitted the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest. Conflicts that the editors consider relevant to the content of the manuscript have been disclosed.</p></div>
