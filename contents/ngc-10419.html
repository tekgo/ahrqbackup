Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>In addition to these evidence-based recommendations, the guideline development group also identifies points of best clinical practice in the original guideline document.</em></p>
<p>Classification of evidence levels (<strong>1++ to 4</strong>) and grades of recommendations (<strong>A&ndash;D</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Red Cell Antibodies in Pregnancy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Red Cell Antibodies Are Clinically Significant (Maternal and Fetal) During Pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - All women should have their blood group and antibody status determined at booking and at 28 weeks of gestation (see Appendix 2 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Implications for the Fetus and Neonate from Red Cell Antibodies?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Clinicians should be aware that severe fetal anaemia can result in hydrops which significantly worsens the perinatal outcome.</p>
<p><strong>When and How Should Paternal and Fetal Genotyping Be Performed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Non-invasive fetal genotyping using maternal blood is now possible for D, C, c, E, e and K antigens. This should be performed in the first instance for the relevant antigen when maternal red cell antibodies are present.</p>
<p><strong>Is Karyotyping Contraindicated in the Presence of Maternal Red Cell Antibodies?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Anti-D prophylaxis should be given to cover invasive testing if the mother is rhesus D (RhD) negative and is not sensitised.</p>
<p><strong>If the Fetus Is at Risk of Anaemia, When Should Referral to a Fetal Medicine Specialist Take Place?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - For antibodies other than anti-D, anti-c and anti-K, the following should prompt referral to a fetal medicine specialist: a history of previous significant haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) or intrauterine transfusion (IUT), or a titre of 32 or above, especially if the titre is rising as rising titres correlate with increasing risk and severity of anaemia.</p>
<p><strong>What Thresholds Should Be Used for the Various Antibodies that Could Cause Fetal Anaemia to Trigger Referral for Further Investigation or Monitoring?</strong></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - An anti-D level of &gt;4 iu/ml but &lt;15 iu/ml correlates with a moderate risk of HDFN and an anti-D level of &gt;15 iu/ml can cause severe HDFN. Referral for a fetal medicine opinion should therefore be made once anti-D levels are &gt;4 iu/ml.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - An anti-c level of &gt;7.5 iu/ml but &lt;20 iu/ml correlates with a moderate risk of HDFN, whereas an anti-c level of &gt;20 iu/ml correlates with a high risk of HDFN. Referral for a fetal medicine opinion should therefore be made once anti-c levels are &gt;7.5 iu/ml.</p>
<p><strong>Once Detected How Often Should Antibody Levels Be Monitored During Pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Anti-D and anti-c levels should be measured every 4 weeks up to 28 weeks of gestation and then every 2 weeks until delivery.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Although anti-K titres do not correlate well with either the development or severity of fetal anaemia, titres should nevertheless be measured every 4 weeks up to 28 weeks of gestation, then every 2 weeks until delivery.</p>
<p><strong>How Should Pregnancies at Risk of Fetal Anaemia Be Monitored?</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - If the fetus carries the corresponding antigen for a maternal antibody which is capable of causing fetal anaemia and if the antibody levels/titres rise beyond the levels detailed in Section 6.7 in the original guideline document then the pregnancy should be monitored weekly by ultrasound, specifically assessing the fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocities (MCA PSV).</p>
<p><strong>If Fetal Transfusion Is Required What Type of Donor Blood Should Be Used?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Red cell preparations for IUT should be group O (low titre haemolysin) or ABO identical with the fetus (if known) and negative for the antigen(s) corresponding to maternal red cell antibodies.</p>
<p><strong>If Maternal Transfusion Is Required, What Type of Donor Blood or Blood Components Should Be Used?</strong></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Red cell components of the same ABO group and RhD type, and that are K negative and cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative, should be selected.</p>
<p><strong>Should RhD-Negative Women Who Have Anti-D or Non-Anti-D Antibodies Receive Routine Antenatal or Postnatal Prophylaxis?</strong></p>
<p><strong>B</strong> - Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given to RhD-negative women with non-anti-D antibodies for routine antenatal prophylaxis, for potential antenatal sensitising events and postnatal prophylaxis.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - If immune anti-D is detected, prophylaxis is no longer necessary.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Discussion and liaison with the transfusion laboratory are essential in determining whether anti-D antibodies are immune or passive in women who have previously received anti-D prophylaxis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements for Blood</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Logistics of Obtaining Blood or Blood Components for the Woman, Fetus or Neonate?</strong></p>
<p><em>Blood for IUT</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Clinicians should be aware that blood for IUT has the same requirements as blood for neonatal exchange (see Section 7.1.3 in the original guideline document), except that plasma is removed by the blood centre to increase the haematocrit to 0.70 to 0.85 and it is always irradiated.</p>
<p><em>Blood for Neonatal Exchange</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Blood should be ABO compatible with the neonate and mother (to avoid ABO HDFN from the woman's anti-A or -B antibodies present), RhD negative (or RhD identical with neonate), K negative, negative for the corresponding antigen to which the woman has an antibody and cross-match compatible with the woman's blood sample.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Blood should be less than 5 days old (to ensure low supernatant potassium levels), CMV negative and irradiated unless the risk to the baby of delaying exchange transfusion while obtaining irradiated blood outweighs this. It should be plasma reduced (rather than in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol [SAGM] additive solution), with a haematocrit of 0.50 to 0.60.</p>
<p><em>Blood for Neonatal Small Volume ('Top-up') Transfusion</em></p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Blood should be ABO compatible with the neonate and mother (to avoid ABO HDFN from the woman's anti-A or -B antibodies present), RhD negative (or RhD identical with neonate), K negative and negative for the corresponding antigen to which the woman has an antibody and cross-match compatible with the woman&rsquo;s blood sample.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Blood should be CMV negative but does not need to be irradiated unless the neonate has had a previous IUT and blood can be stored in SAGM (rather than plasma reduced) and be up to 35 days old (as a top-up transfusion is a much smaller volume than an exchange transfusion).</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> - Clinicians considering transfusion in a neonate must check if the baby has had an IUT, as if so, blood must be irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>How Should the Neonate Be Managed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - This depends on the risk of haemolysis or anaemia conferred by the relevant red cell antibody. The neonate should have regular clinical assessment of its neurobehavioural state and be observed for the development of jaundice and/or anaemia.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Clinicians should be aware that if bilirubin levels rise rapidly or above the interventional threshold, phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion may be required.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Long-Term Consequences of Red Cell Antibodies to Women and Their Offspring</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What Are the Long-Term Health Concerns for the Children of Women with Red Cell Antibodies During Pregnancy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Clinicians should be aware that some infants may experience anaemia persisting for a few weeks following birth.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> - Clinicians should be aware that some infants may develop late anaemia which is usually due to hyporegenerative anaemia.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>This Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG) guideline was developed in accordance with standard methodology for producing RCOG Green-top Guidelines. The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), DARE, EMBASE, TRIP, MEDLINE and PubMed (electronic databases) were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and other studies. The search was restricted to articles published between 1960 and July 2013. The databases were searched using the relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including all subheadings, and this was combined with a keyword search. Search terms included: red cell antibody, red blood cell antigen, erythroblastosis fetalis, blood group incompatibility, haemolytic disease of newborn, anti-D, anti-c, anti-E, anti-K, Kidd, Duffy, Diego alloimmunisation. The search was limited to humans and the English language. National Health Service (NHS) Evidence and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) were also searched for relevant guidelines and reviews.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reviewing and Grading of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Once the evidence has been collated for each clinical question it needs to be appraised and reviewed (refer to section 3 in "Development of RCOG Green-top guidelines: producing a clinical practice guideline" for information on the formulation of the clinical questions; see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). For each question, the study type with least chance of bias should be used. If available, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of suitable size and quality should be used in preference to observational data. This may vary depending on the outcome being examined.</p>
<p>The level of evidence and the grade of the recommendations used in this guideline originate from the guidance by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Grading Review Group, which incorporates formal assessment of the methodological quality, quantity, consistency, and applicability of the evidence base. The methods used to appraise individual study types are available from the SIGN Web site (<a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/checklists.html" title="SIGN Web site">www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/checklists.html</a>). An objective appraisal of study quality is essential, but paired reviewing by guideline leads may be impractical because of resource constraints.</p>
<p>Once evidence has been collated and appraised, it can be graded. A judgement on the quality of the evidence will be necessary using the grading system (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Where evidence is felt to warrant 'down-grading', for whatever reason, the rationale must be stated. Evidence judged to be of poor quality can be excluded. Any study with a high chance of bias (either 1&ndash; or 2&ndash;) will be excluded from the guideline and recommendations will not be based on this evidence. This prevents recommendations being based on poor-quality RCTs when higher-quality observational evidence is available.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Development</strong></p>
<p>The development of guidelines involves more than the collation and reviewing of evidence. Even with high-quality data from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, a value judgement is needed when comparing one therapy with another. This will therefore introduce the need for consensus.</p>
<p>Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top guidelines are drafted by nominated developers, in contrast to other guideline groups such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), who use larger guideline development groups. Equally, in contrast to other guideline groups, the topics chosen for development as Green-top guidelines are concise enough to allow development by a smaller group of individuals.</p>
<p>In agreeing the precise wording of evidence-based guideline recommendations and in developing consensus-based 'good practice points', the Guidelines Committee (GC) will employ an informal consensus approach through group discussion. In line with current methodologies, the entire development process will follow strict guidance and be both transparent and robust. The RCOG acknowledges that formal consensus methods have been described, but these require further evaluation in the context of clinical guideline development. It is envisaged that this will not detract from the rigor of the process but prevent undue delays in development.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Non-invasive genotyping is not possible for some red cell antigens. In these cases invasive testing (chorionic villus sampling [CVS] or amniocentesis) may be considered. However, the risks of the procedure (miscarriage, worsening of alloimmunisation) need to be balanced against the benefit that knowledge of the fetal genotype brings to the management of the pregnancy. </li>
    <li>The risks and benefits of intrauterine transfusion (IUT) should always be discussed with the woman who should be made aware of the consequences of untreated severe fetal anaemia (i.e. hydrops, preterm birth, perinatal death, severe neonatal jaundice and kernicterus) as well as the risks of neonatal exchange transfusion. </li>
    <li>The decision to use ABO-, rhesus D (RhD-) and K-compatible blood that is not matched for other antibodies (or O negative, where the woman's ABO and RhD groups are unknown) should be made on the balance of risks (severe haemorrhage versus a haemolytic transfusion reaction). </li>
    <li>Once referral to a fetal medicine specialist has been made for assessment of pregnancy at moderate or high risk of haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), the value of subsequent quantitation of anti-D and anti-c levels is doubtful. Further testing is however required at 28 weeks for the development of additional red cell antibodies. Caution is required however if there is a history of a severely affected previous pregnancy even if the antibody levels are low in the current pregnancy. </li>
    <li>Middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocities (MCA PSV) monitoring is predictive of moderate or severe fetal anaemia with 100% sensitivity and a false positive rate of 12%. Monitoring with MCA PSV should be used with caution after 36 weeks as its sensitivity for the detection of fetal anaemia decreases. </li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>These recommendations are not intended to dictate an exclusive course of management or treatment. They must be evaluated with reference to individual patient needs, resources and limitations unique to the institution and variations in local populations. It is hoped that this process of local ownership will help to incorporate these guidelines into routine practice. Attention is drawn to areas of clinical uncertainty where further research may be indicated. </li>
    <li>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) produces guidelines as an educational aid to good clinical practice. They present recognised methods and techniques of clinical practice, based on published evidence, for consideration by obstetricians and gynaecologists and other relevant health professionals. The ultimate judgement regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the doctor or other attendant in the light of clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatment options available within the appropriate health services. This means that RCOG Guidelines are unlike protocols or guidelines issued by employers, as they are not intended to be prescriptive directions defining a single course of management. Departure from the local prescriptive protocols or guidelines should be fully documented in the patient's case notes at the time the relevant decision is taken. </li>
