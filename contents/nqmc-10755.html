<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The benefit of colorectal cancer screening for an individual patient is dependent on that patient's life expectancy and probability of harm from colonoscopy. Individuals over age 85 have an average life expectancy of less than 5 years (Cho et al., 2013) and are at increased risk for colonoscopy-related complications (Warren et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The population of individuals 85 years and older is projected to double by 2050, hence, the clinical and economic effects of inappropriate performance of colorectal cancer screening in this age group can be expected to increase in the coming decade (Goodwin et al., 2011). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>:</p>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2008) recommends three screening regimens for individuals 50 to 75 years of age with average risk:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Annual high-sensitivity fecal occult blood tests (FOBT)</li>
    <li>Sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, combined with high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing every 3 years</li>
    <li>Optical colonoscopy every 10 years</li>
</ul>
<p>For individuals from 76 to 85 years of age, the Task Force recommends against routine performance of screening unless individuals have not been previously screened, in which case it should be considered in the context of health status and competing risks for each individual (USPSTF, 2008). </p>
<p>For individuals older than 85 years, the Task Force recommends against screening when comparing overall benefits to harms (USPSTF, 2008). The Task Force based these recommendations on a systematic review of the literature, supplemented with modeling data (USPSTF, 2008; Physician Data Query [PDQ] Screening and Prevention Editorial Board, 2002; Cummings &amp; Cooper, 2011). </p>
<p>For this subgroup, the Task Force concluded that the utility of screening is limited, given the time it takes for a polyp to develop into a clinically observable malignancy (10 to 26 years) (USPSTF, 2008; PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board, 2002; Cummings &amp; Cooper, 2011). </p>
<p>Moreover, individuals older than 85 are likely to have multiple comorbidities that influence any potential life-year gain (USPSTF, 2008; PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board, 2002; Cummings &amp; Cooper, 2011). They are also at increased risk of suffering from adverse events related to performance of a colonoscopy, with the rate of adverse events being 2.8 per 1,000 procedures and increased by seven-fold if a polypectomy is performed (USPSTF, 2008; Joseph et al., 2012; PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board, 2002).</p></div>

    <li><strong>Inverse Measure</strong>: A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control. The "Performance Not Met" numerator option for this measure is the representation of the better clinical quality or control. Reporting that numerator option will produce a performance rate that trends closer to 0%, as quality increases. For inverse measures a rate of 100% means all of the denominator eligible patients did not receive the appropriate care or were not in proper control, and therefore an inverse measure at 100% does not qualify for reporting purposes, however any reporting rate less than 100% does qualify. </li>
