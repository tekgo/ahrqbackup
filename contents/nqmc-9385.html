Description

<div class='FieldValue'>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Despite clinical practice guidelines and an ever-growing body of evidence that support the delay of elective repeat cesarean section (ERCS) to 39 weeks gestation, recent data for the province of Ontario indicates that between 30% and 60% of ERCS is performed prior to this (Sprague, 2010).</p>
<p>Early-term birth by ERCS (less than 39 weeks) is associated with increased morbidity in the neonate, most notably respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) in addition to higher rates of admission to neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Multiple studies have produced data that, even when adjusted for possible confounding factors, have consistently shown these outcomes to be inversely related to gestational age (GA) at delivery (Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RANZCOG], 2009).</p>
<p>As such, many obstetric organizations around the world now advocate that uncomplicated ERCS not be performed before 39 weeks gestation (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], 2007; RANZCOG, 2009; Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG], 2007).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Early-term elective repeat cesarean section (ERCS) (37 to 38 weeks) has consistently been associated with increased risks to the neonate, including respiratory morbidity, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and lengthier hospital stays when compared with ERCS at 39 to 40 weeks. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies, guideline-producing bodies and expert consensus unanimously agree that delaying ERCS to greater than or equal to 39 weeks significantly reduces these risks. </li>
    <li>Studies addressing the timing of ERCS at term are limited and generally of lower quality; most studies examining ERCS compare maternal and neonatal outcomes between vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) and ERCS. </li>
    <li>Current rates of ERCS less than 39 weeks in Ontario exceed what is expected would be necessary and reasons for this are not well defined. </li>
    <li>Ensuring adherence to guidelines dictating the timing of uncomplicated, term ERCS may pose specific challenges to clinicians, health policy and decision makers. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <em>What is Known About the Timing of Elective Repeat Cesarean Section?</em> for a summary of the evidence around early-term ERCS to help inform evidence-based guidelines and advance practice in the province of Ontario.</p>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>To validate the seven potential indicators as being appropriate for use throughout the province, the authors first extracted data from the BORN Information System (BIS) for fiscal year 2009 to 2010 to assess historical and current performance on these indicators across Ontario's 14 health regions (Local Health Integration Networks). Simultaneously, evidence summaries on each of the potential indicators were developed in collaboration with the Knowledge to Action Research Centre at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Thielman et al., 2011; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What are the drivers," 2010; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What are the maternal," 2011; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What is known," 2011; Khangura, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, 2010). This group, which has expertise in the review and synthesis of literature to support evidence-informed health care decision-making, assisted with determining the level of scientific evidence to support each indicator. For example, the evidence summary on early term repeat Caesarean section (i.e., before 39 weeks' gestation) in a defined population determined that as a result of this practice there were indeed objective risks to babies that could be reduced by delaying delivery.</p>
<p>Following review of the data and evidence summaries, the committee removed one indicator and refined some of the others, leaving six. In five of the six, the potential for improvement in rates was obvious. The remaining indicator (rate of screening for group B streptococcus) is currently satisfactory throughout all health regions of the province; however, the committee felt it was important at the outset to have the dashboard reflect not only performance areas requiring improvement, but also areas in which performance was good.</p></div>
