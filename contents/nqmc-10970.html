<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older undergoing elective esophagectomy for esophageal cancer who developed any of the following postoperative conditions: bleeding requiring reoperation, anastomotic leak requiring medical or surgical treatment, reintubation/respiratory failure, initial ventilation greater than 48 hours, pneumonia, or discharge mortality. </p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>It is important for surgeons to be able to compare their surgical outcomes to those of peer institutions as a
means of assessing results and improving quality of care. Measuring risk‐adjusted morbidity and mortality of
patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer provides surgeons and institutions the opportunity to evaluate
outcomes and subsequently design quality improvement initiatives to address identified deficits. Utilization of
the insight gained should promote improved patient outcome.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Esophageal cancer is an aggressive disease with a generally poor prognosis. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing faster than any other malignancy in the United States. In 2015, there were an estimated 16,980 people diagnosed with esophageal cancer.</p>
<p>Esophagectomy, a relatively high morbidity and mortality operation, remains a key therapy in treating patients with localized esophageal cancer. The 30-day mortality rate following esophagectomy ranges between 2.7% and 11%. Within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) General Thoracic Surgery Database (GTSD), 24% of patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer experienced major postoperative morbidity or death. Those with a major morbidity had a hospital discharge mortality of 11% while those patients without a major morbidity had a mortality rate of zero. This analysis identified a number of statistically significant predictors of major morbidity or mortality after esophagectomy for cancer. These factors included age, race, cardiac disease, impaired lung function, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, functional status, smoking status, and steroid use. Recognition of these predictors preoperatively, and modifying them when possible may provide improved outcomes, as measured by mortality, length of stay, postoperative quality of life, overall costs and resource utilization. Some of these preoperative predictors are modifiable, such as smoking status, and have been shown to reduce complication rates. Pulmonary complications are the major source of morbidity and mortality after esophageal resection, and numerous studies have identified various factors associated with these complications. Preoperative factors affecting pulmonary complications include advanced age, poor nutritional status, and poor cardiopulmonary reserve. Intraoperative factors associated with increased rates of pulmonary complications include increased blood loss, excessive fluid administration, prolonged operative times, advanced or proximal esophageal tumors, and more extensive operations, including the McKeown resection with three-field lymph node dissection. Postoperative factors associated with pulmonary complications include the development of atrial fibrillation, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and aspiration or other abnormality of deglutition. Enhanced recovery pathways and fast-track protocols, have been shown to reduce major morbidity and length of stay without increasing mortality or readmissions. Knowing their rate of risk adjusted morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy gives thoracic programs the opportunity to design quality improvement initiatives around deficiencies.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>General Thoracic Surgery Database (GTSD) participating sites are randomly selected for participation in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) GTSD Audit, which is designed to evaluate the accuracy, consistency, and comprehensiveness of data collection and ultimately validate the integrity of the data contained in the database. Telligen, formerly the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care, has conducted audits on behalf of STS since 2006. In 2015, ten percent of randomly selected STS GTSD participants (N = 25, an increase from 24 in 2014 and 18 in 2013) were audited. The audit process involves re‐abstraction of data for 20 cases records (at least 15 lobectomy and up to 5 esophagectomy) and comparison of 40 STS GTSD V2.2 individual data elements with those submitted to the data warehouse. Agreement rates are calculated for each variable, each variable category and overall. In 2015, the overall aggregate agreement rate was 97.02%, demonstrating that the data contained in the STS GTSD are both comprehensive and highly accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis</strong> </p>
<p>Aggregate agreement rates were computed for all facilities by calculation of the sum of all facilities' numerators divided by the sum of all facilities' denominators, for each individual variable, each variable category and overall. </p>
<p>Chi-square statistics were calculated to identify any possible relationships between the data collection process variables and agreement rates. Tests where the chi-square statistic had a probability of less than 5% (p less than 0.05) were considered to show statistically significant differences in agreement rate between the levels of the process measure. </p>
<p><strong>Agreement Rate Results </strong></p>
<p>Database validity was evaluated by re-abstraction of defined variables from the medical records and comparison to submitted data. Agreement rates were calculated at the individual variable level, category level and overall. Aggregate agreement rates are presented in the table in the original measure documentation. There were 14,854 total variables abstracted and of those 14,412 variables matched, resulting in an overall agreement rate of 97.02%. </p>
<p><strong>Process Variable Correlation Tables </strong></p>
<p>The relationships between process variables and overall agreement rates were examined and included: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Facility data collection performed from electronic medical records or a combination of paper and electronic medical records and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Facility data collection method (concurrent/retrospective/both) and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Data collection performed by a single abstractor or multiple staff and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Attendance at the annual data managers' meeting, STS Advances in Quality and Outcomes (AQO) Conference, and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Agreed upon abstraction location for data elements documented in multiple locations and overall agreement rate </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Relationship between Data Collection Source &amp; Agreement Rate</em> </p>
<p>Facilities using an electronic health record (EHR) for data collection had higher agreement rates, 97.36%, than those facilities using both paper medical records and an EHR, 96.31%. There were no facilities that used paper medical records alone (p less than 0.0004). </p>
<p><em>Relationship between Data Collection Method &amp; Agreement Rate </em></p>
<p>Facilities collecting data retrospectively have higher agreement rates, 97.55%, than those facilities collecting data concurrently, 96.18%, or both, 96.38% (p equal to or less than 0.0001).</p>
<p><em>Relationship between Data Collection Performed by a Single Abstractor or Multiple Staff &amp; Agreement Rate </em></p>
<p>Facilities with a single individual performing data abstraction have higher agreement rates, 98.02%, than those facilities that have multiple individuals performing data abstraction, 96.24% (p less than 0.0001). </p>
<p><em>Relationship between Attendance at AQO Conference &amp; Agreement Rate</em> </p>
<p>Facilities having staff attend the annual AQO Conference have higher agreement rates, 97.25%, than those that do not have staff attend, 96.11% (p less than 0.0012). </p>
<p><em>Relationship between Have an Agreed Upon Location &amp; Agreement Rate </em></p>
<p>Facilities that utilize an agreed upon location for data elements recorded in multiple locations have higher agreement rates, 97.31%, than facilities that do not utilize an agreed upon location, 93.61% (p less than 0.0001). </p>
<p>In addition, validity is regularly assessed by an expert panel of general thoracic surgeons assembled by the STS General Thoracic Surgery Database Task Force, the STS Quality Measurement Task Force, and the STS Task Force on Quality Initiatives, all of which report to the STS Workforce on National Databases.</p></div>
