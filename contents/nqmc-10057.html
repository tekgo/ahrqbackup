<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients age greater than or equal to 18 years diagnosed with chronic kidney disease whose blood pressure is at systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than 90 mmHg.</p></div>
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients with chronic disease whose blood pressure (BP) is under control.</p>
<p>Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) Recommendation (4) is fully endorsed by the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) Hypertension Diagnosis and Treatment Work Group:</p>
<p>"In the population aged greater than or equal to 18 years with chronic kidney disease (CKD), initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 90 mmHg and treat to goal SBP less than 140 mmHg and goal DBP less than 90 mmHg" (James et al., 2014).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) has long had a policy of transparency in declaring potential conflicting and competing interests of all individuals who participate in the development, revision and approval of ICSI guidelines and protocols. </p>
<p>In 2010, the ICSI Conflict of Interest Review Committee was established by the Board of Directors to review all disclosures and make recommendations to the board when steps should be taken to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, including recommendations regarding removal of work group members. This committee has adopted the Institute of Medicine Conflict of Interest standards as outlined in the report Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2011). </p>
<p>Where there are work group members with identified potential conflicts, these are disclosed and discussed at the initial work group meeting. These members are expected to recuse themselves from related discussions or authorship of related recommendations, as directed by the Conflict of Interest committee or requested by the work group.</p>
