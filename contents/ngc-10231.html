Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em><strong>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong></em>: The following guidance was current as of December 2013. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/newpnc.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text for detailed information on each of the screening procedures.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Points</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prenatal Care Summary</strong></p>
<p>Main aspects of prenatal care (history and examination, testing and treatment, and education and planning) are summarized from preconception through delivery in Table 1 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Fetal Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>Common indications for antepartum fetal surveillance and gestational age at which to initiate testing as well as frequency of testing are presented in Table 2 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Referral</strong></p>
<p>Indications for referral are summarized in Table 3 in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Important Care Aspects</strong></p>
<p class="Indent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assess risk factors</span>. For all women, perform a history and physical that includes a risk assessment with a goal of identifying risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome <em>[I-D]</em>.</p>
<p class="Indent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Visit timing and frequency</span>. For average risk women, the first prenatal visit should be an intake at 6 to 8 weeks, with provider review and a follow-up office visit at 10 to 12 weeks. Subsequent visits may occur on a schedule of every 4 to 6 weeks until 34 weeks, then every 2 weeks until 37 weeks, and weekly thereafter <em>[I-C]</em>.</p>
<p class="Indent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Progesterone therapy</span>. Progesterone should be offered to patients who have a history of prior spontaneous preterm birth or who are found to have a shortened cervix on ultrasound <em>[I-A]</em>.</p>
<p class="Indent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing</span>. Test all women for sexually transmissible infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients at risk for STIs during pregnancy should be retested in the third trimester <em>[I-A]</em>.</p>
<p class="Indent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Estimated delivery date (EDD)</span>. Establish a patient's EDD prior to 20 weeks, with consideration given to menstrual history, mode of conception, and sonographic findings using standardized criteria (refer to the "Delivery Planning" section in the original guideline document) <em>[I-C]</em>. </p>
<p class="Indent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diabetes risk</span>. At the first prenatal visit evaluate risk factors for diabetes and test high-risk patients <em>[I-C]</em>. Screen all women without a diagnosis of diabetes for gestational diabetes at 24 to 28 weeks using a 50 gram glucose challenge with a cutoff of &ge;135 mg/dl at 1 hour <em>[1-A]</em>.</p>
<p class="Indent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tetanus diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccination</span>. Offer Tdap vaccination to all women. This is optimally performed at 27 to 36 weeks in order to facilitate passive immunization of newborns for pertussis <em>[I-D]</em>.</p>
<p class="Indent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No non-medically-indicated delivery &lt;39 weeks</span>. Non-medically-indicated planned delivery before 39 weeks' gestation is contraindicated <em>[III-B]</em>.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For this update the initial evidence base was the literature search performed to develop the 2006 version of this guideline. The team accepted the literature search performed to produce the Veterans Administration (VA)/Department of Defense (DoD)&nbsp;and Veterans Administration to produce the VA/DoD Practice Guideline for Pregnancy Management (2009). That search included literature through December 2007. A MEDLINE search for literature published since that time was performed. The search was conducted prospectively using the major key words of pregnancy (prenatal care); guidelines, controlled trials, cohort studies; published from 1/1/08 through 1/31/12, women (adolescent, adult), English language. Specific searches were performed for: Genetic screening &amp; counseling (hemoglobinopathies, cystic fibrosis, Ashkenazi Jews), Nutrition counseling (folic acid, calcium supplementation, diet/foods), other counseling (weight gain in pregnancy, exercise, contraception counseling), Laboratory studies (rubella titer, hemoglobin/hematocrit, Hepatitis B surface antigen, HIV, Rh factor blood type, urine culture or urinalysis, screening for sexually transmitted disease, Pap smear, hypothyroidism, TB testing), comorbid conditions (obesity, depression, domestic violence, recurrent preterm birth, herpes simplex management, prenatal visits (frequency, urine dipstick, fetal growth assessment, fetal imaging/ultrasound, gestational age determination, screening for aneuploidy, screening for neural tube defects, screening for diabetes/gestational diabetes, anemia, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, fetal movement counts, group B streptococcus, breech, membrane sweeping, identification of a pediatrician, delivery (timing, repeat cesarean delivery and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, elective primary cesarean delivery), breast feeding, indications for referral to high risk care, cultural sensitivity.</p>
<p>The searches were supplemented with recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. The search was single cycle.</p></div>
