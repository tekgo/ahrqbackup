<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of respondents who indicated whether ("Yes or "No") their family member's basic needs were met.</p>
<p>This "Meeting Basic Needs: Help with Eating, Drinking, and Toileting" composite measure is based on three questions in the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Member Survey that asks respondents (defined as family members of nursing home residents) whether the resident was made to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Wait too long for help with eating </li>
    <li>Wait too long for help with drinking </li>
    <li>Wait too long for help with toileting </li>
</ul>
<p>The Family Member Survey asks respondents to report on their own experiences (not the resident's) with the nursing home and their perceptions of the quality of care provided to a family member living in a nursing home. This instrument is designed to be administered by mail. </p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: A composite score is calculated in which a higher score indicates better quality. Composite scores are intended for consumer-level (nursing home) reporting.</p></div>
</div>

</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The CAHPS Nursing Home Surveys include three instruments designed to provide information on the experiences of nursing home residents and their family members. Multiple versions of the Nursing Home Surveys are available to meet different needs:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Long-Stay Resident Survey </li>
    <li>Discharged Resident </li>
    <li>Family Member Survey </li>
</ul>
<p>The Nursing Home Surveys can be used in monitoring programs designed to improve both care quality and patient satisfaction.</p>
<p>Although the family members do not receive care from the nursing home, their experiences at the nursing home and with staff are important in describing the quality of the nursing home. Family members often help choose the nursing home and continue to be involved with their family member after entry, participating in care planning and making decisions on behalf of the resident. Like the CAHPS Nursing Home Resident Surveys, the family reported experiences of care complement other, publicly reported data such as health deficiencies, staffing, and other quality indicators (e.g., percent of residents with restraints), and thus contribute to providing a comprehensive view of quality care.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services requested development of this questionnaire to complement the Long-Stay Resident Instrument, especially for those residents who may be too impaired to respond for themselves. </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Development of the CAHPS Family Member Survey included:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Cognitive testing of survey questions</em>. In 2005 and 2006, the items in this instrument went through two rounds of cognitive testing (n=54) with people who have family members in nursing homes. Persons were selected so as to assure variation in race, ethnicity, and education. Trained cognitive interviewers conducted one-on-one, in-person interviews. Using a "think-aloud" approach for the interviews, participants were asked to read each question (or read the question verbally to the participant), provide a verbal response, and explain the reason for the response. Interviewers then followed up with probes after each of the questions to ask about specific potential problems with each item. Immediately after each interview, the interviewer wrote a summary of the participant's comments. A member of each grantee team reviewed these summaries and extracted common themes for each item. At the end of each round, the team met to review these themes and make recommendations to the larger family survey team. The larger team made decisions together regarding each of the items. </li>
    <li><em>Field testing</em>. With the assistance of the Texas State Long Term Care Ombudsman, the CAHPS Team conducted a field test at 15 nursing homes in Texas between October 2006 and January 2007. Additionally, the Health Quality Council of Alberta conducted an independent field test with 14 nursing homes in Alberta, Canada, and contributed their data for the psychometric analyses. Analyses were done both jointly and separately. Data from the pilot survey (n=885) were subjected to psychometric analyses to evaluate the measurement properties of items as well as the reliability and validity of the resulting composites. On the basis of these analyses and input from experts, the survey was finalize. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>The CAHPS Team recommends adjusting the survey data for respondent age, education, and general health status. This makes it more likely that reported differences are due to real differences in performance, rather than differences in the characteristics of enrollees or patients.</p>
<p>The CAHPS team recommends four items to be case-mix adjusters for the CAHPS Nursing Home Family Survey: 1) respondent age, 2) respondent education, 3) whether the respondent believes the resident will permanently live in the nursing home, and 4) respondent's belief about whether the resident was capable of making decisions. Several additional items were considered as potential adjusters but were rejected for a variety of reasons. Refer to the <em>CAHPS Survey for Family Members of Nursing Home Residents Final Report</em> in the "Companion Documents" field for a full description of the risk adjustment process.</p>
