<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There are approximately 1 million emergency department (ED) visits per year for non-traumatic dental conditions in the United States and more than 200,000 visits are made by children (Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits involving dental conditions," 2014; Seu, Hall, &amp; Moy, 2012; Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits with dental conditions among children," 2014). Untreated dental caries (tooth decay) and its sequelae (e.g., dental infections) account for almost 80% of these visits (Seu, Hall, &amp; Moy, 2012; Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits with dental conditions among children," 2014). Dental caries is preventable, and use of the ED for dental caries related conditions results in substantial costs&nbsp;(Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits involving dental conditions," 2014; Allareddy et al., "Hospital-based emergency department visits with dental conditions among children," 2014). Moreover, ED care for dental caries-related conditions is generally not definitive compared to that provided in primary care dental settings and often results in referral to primary care dental sites (Cohen et al., 2011; Hocker et al., 2012; Lewis, Lynch, &amp; Johnston, 2003).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This system-level measure focuses specifically on dental caries-related emergency department (ED) visits because: (1) dental caries (tooth decay) plays a central role in dental disease among children, (2) dental caries incidence can reduced through routine and preventive dental care, and (3) dental caries, once present, can be effectively managed in outpatient settings with early identification and treatment. Consequently ED visits for caries-related reasons by children is a system-level outcome representing an avoidable deterioration in oral health and overall health due to untreated dental caries. This outcome can be positively impacted by evidenced-based processes of care delivered in outpatient dental settings.</p>
<p>Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). In 2009 to 2010, 14% of children aged 3 to 5 years had untreated dental caries. Among children aged 6 to 9 years, 17% had untreated dental caries, and among adolescents aged 13 to 15, 11% had untreated dental caries (Dye, Li, &amp; Thorton-Evans, 2012). Untreated dental decay among children has significant short- and long-term adverse consequences (Tinanoff &amp; Reisine, 2009). Among the more significant of these outcomes is emergency department visits for dental caries-related problems (e.g., tooth pain, abscesses). </p>
<p>Dental conditions, primarily from untreated dental caries (tooth decay), are responsible for the majority of non-traumatic dental-related ED visits among children (Allareddy et al., 2014). Non-traumatic dental-related ED visits have been increasing over time. An analysis of the trends in ED visits with non-traumatic dental-related International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes for the overall population using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data found that non-traumatic dental-related ED visits increased by 4% annually on average over the period 1997 to 2007, exceeding the rate of growth both for ED visits in general and for ED visits for non-dental ambulatory care sensitive conditions (Okunseri et al., 2012). </p>
<p>ED care for dental caries-related problems is generally not definitive compared to that provided in primary care dental settings and often results in referral to primary care dental sites (Cohen et al., 2011; Hocker et al., 2012). However, these ED visits could be significantly reduced through routine clinical oral evaluations, receipt of evidence-based preventive services, and adoption of good oral health habits by children and their caregivers (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, 2013; Ahovuo-Saloranta et al., 2013; Beauchamp et al., 2008; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2004; Tinanoff &amp; Reisine, 2009; Weyant et al., 2013). </p></div>

Dental Quality Alliance measures are developed through an environmental scan of measure concepts that are evaluated through a modified Delphi consensus process using expert panels. Measure concepts rated high on importance, feasibility, and validity are selected for measure development. Developed measures are tested for feasibility, reliability and validity following measure scientific acceptability guidance from the National Quality Forum. Measures are also evaluated through a formal public comment process. Measures that complete testing are presented to the full Dental Quality Alliance membership for formal approval. </p></div>
