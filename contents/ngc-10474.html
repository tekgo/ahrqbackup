Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the overall quality of evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low, insufficient</strong>) and the strength of the recommendations (<strong>strong, weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: The American College of Physicians recommends against performing screening pelvic examination in asymptomatic, nonpregnant, adult women (<strong>strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence</strong>).</p>
<p>The current evidence shows that harms outweigh any demonstrated benefits associated with the screening pelvic examination. Indirect evidence showed that screening pelvic examination does not reduce mortality or morbidity rates in asymptomatic adult women, as 1 trial showed that screening for ovarian cancer with more sensitive tests (transvaginal ultrasonography and CA-125) also did not reduce mortality or morbidity rates. Because CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasonography found all cancer detected by the screening pelvic examination as well as additional cancer and this earlier detection did not lead to a reduction in morbidity or mortality rates, the guideline authors conclude that the screening pelvic examination alone would also not reduce morbidity or mortality rates. No studies assessed the benefit of pelvic examination for other gynecologic conditions, such as asymptomatic pelvic inflammatory disease, benign conditions, or gynecologic cancer other than cervical or ovarian cancer. Also, there is low-quality evidence that screening pelvic examination leads to harms, including fear, anxiety, embarrassment, pain, and discomfort, and possibly prevents women from receiving medical care. In addition, false-positive screening results can lead to unnecessary laparoscopies or laparotomies. Note that this guideline is focused on screening asymptomatic women; full pelvic examination with bimanual examinations is indicated in some nonscreening clinical situations. This guideline does not address women who are due for cervical cancer screening. However, the recommended cervical cancer screening examination should be limited to visual inspection of the cervix and cervical swabs for cancer and human papillomavirus and should not entail a full pelvic examination.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Grading of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered high quality when it is obtained from 1 or more well-designed and well-executed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that yield consistent and directly applicable results. This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Evidence</strong>: Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose-response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.</p>
<p><strong>Insufficient Evidence to Determine Net Benefits or Risks</strong>: When the evidence is insufficient to determine for or against routinely providing a service, the recommendation was graded as "insufficient evidence to determine net benefits or risks." Evidence may be conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking, and hence the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Any estimate of effect that is very uncertain as evidence is either unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.</p>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse</strong>: A systematic evidence review was prepared by Minneapolis Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System's Evidence-based Synthesis Program Center (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Data Sources</strong></p>
<p>The Minneapolis Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System's Evidence-based Synthesis Program Center's staff searched the Ovid MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for articles published from 1946 through January 2014 to identify studies of any design other than case series or case reports. The staff limited the search to English-language studies involving human participants. Search terms included the following Medical Subject Headings: gynecological examination, women's health, and mass screening. In addition, the staff used the "related citations" feature of PubMed to identify an additional 826 English-language abstracts and obtained articles by hand-searching reference lists of existing systematic reviews and pertinent studies and from suggestions from their technical expert panel and peer reviewers. The full search strategy is presented in the Appendix of the systematic review.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection</strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently evaluated each abstract to determine whether it met predefined criteria. The staff included background papers and guidelines (published within the past 5 years), clinical trials, cohort or case-control studies, or cross-sectional survey studies conducted in asymptomatic, nonpregnant, average-risk women seen in outpatient settings that reported outcomes of interest. These outcomes included diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value), morbidity or mortality from pathologic conditions detected on pelvic examination, and harms directly related to pelvic examination or indirect harms from examination findings (false reassurance, overdiagnosis, overtreatment, or diagnostic procedure-related harms). Full-text reports of studies identified as potentially eligible on abstract review were independently reviewed by 2 investigators. The figure in the systematic review shows the reasons for study exclusion at full-text review.</p></div>

<p><strong>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</strong></p>
<p>A single investigator extracted details on study design, patient characteristics, and outcomes data onto tables. A second investigator verified the extraction. The Minneapolis Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System's Evidence-based Synthesis Program Center's staff assessed the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies using a modification of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. The staff assessed the quality of survey studies using a questionnaire we developed that included these domains: sampling strategy (population-based vs. convenience), incorporation of the sampling structure into the analysis, use of a validated or piloted survey instrument, appropriate method for handling missing data, comparison of responders and nonresponders, and response rates.</p>
<p><strong>Data Synthesis and Analysis</strong></p>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Routine pelvic examination in asymptomatic, nonpregnant, adult women add unnecessary costs to the health care system ($2.6 billion in the United States). These costs may be compounded by expenses incurred by additional follow-up tests, including follow-up tests as a result of false-positive screening results, increased medical visits, and costs of keeping or obtaining health insurance.</p></div>
