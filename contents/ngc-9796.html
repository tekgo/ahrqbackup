Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grading system for the class of recommendations <strong>(I, II, IIa, IIb, III)</strong> and the levels of evidence <strong>(A&ndash;C)</strong> are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation and Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis should be performed and ascitic fluid should be obtained from inpatients and outpatients with clinically apparent new-onset ascites <strong>(Class I, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Since bleeding is sufficiently uncommon, the routine prophylactic use of fresh frozen plasma or platelets before paracentesis is not recommended <strong>(Class III, Level C)</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ascitic Fluid Analysis and Differential Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>The initial laboratory investigation of ascitic fluid should include an ascitic fluid cell count and differential, ascitic fluid total protein, and serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) <strong>(Class I, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>If ascitic fluid infection is suspected, ascitic fluid should be cultured at the bedside in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles prior to initiation of antibiotics <strong>(Class I, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Other studies of ascitic fluid can be ordered based on the pretest probability of disease (Refer to Table 3 in the original guideline document for ascitic fluid laboratory data) <strong>(Class IIa, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Testing serum for cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is not helpful in the differential diagnosis of ascites. Its use is not recommended in patients with ascites of any type <strong>(Class III, Level B)</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treatment of Ascites</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="7">
    <li>Patients with ascites who are thought to have an alcohol component to their liver injury should abstain from alcohol consumption <strong>(Class I, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Baclofen can be given to reduce alcohol craving and alcohol consumption in patients with ascites in the setting of alcoholic liver disease <strong>(Class IIb, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>First-line treatment of patients with cirrhosis and ascites consists of sodium restriction (88 mmol per day [2000 mg per day], diet education) and diuretics (oral spironolactone with or without oral furosemide) <strong>(Class IIa, Level A)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Fluid restriction is not necessary unless serum sodium is less than 125 mmol/L <strong>(Class III, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Vaptans may improve serum sodium in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. However their use does not currently appear justified in view of their expense, potential risks, and lack of evidence of efficacy in clinically meaningful outcomes <strong>(Class III, Level A)</strong>. </li>
    <li>An initial therapeutic abdominal paracentesis should be performed in patients with tense ascites. Sodium restriction and oral diuretics should then be initiated <strong>(Class IIa, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Diuretic-sensitive patients should preferably be treated with sodium restriction and oral diuretics rather than with serial paracenteses <strong>(Class IIa, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with cirrhosis and ascites may be harmful, must be carefully considered in each patient, monitoring blood pressure and renal function <strong>(Class III, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, except in special circumstances <strong>(Class III, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with cirrhosis and ascites <strong>(Class I, Level B)</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Refractory Ascites</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="17">
    <li>The risks versus benefits of beta blockers must be carefully weighed in each patient with refractory ascites. Systemic hypotension often complicates their use. Consideration should be given to discontinuing or not initiating these drugs in this setting <strong>(Class III, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided in patients with refractory ascites. Systemic hypotension often complicates their use <strong>(Class III, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Oral midodrine has been shown to improve clinical outcomes and survival in patients with refractory ascites; its use should be considered in this setting <strong>(Class IIa, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Serial therapeutic paracenteses are a treatment option for patients with refractory ascites <strong>(Class I, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Post-paracentesis albumin infusion may not be necessary for a single paracentesis of less than 4 to 5 L <strong>(Class I, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>For large-volume paracenteses, an albumin infusion of 6-8 g per liter of fluid removed appears to improve survival and is recommended <strong>(Class IIa, Level A)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Referral for liver transplantation should be expedited in patients with refractory ascites, if the patient is otherwise a candidate for transplantation <strong>(Class IIa, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS) may be considered in appropriately selected patients who meet criteria similar to those of published randomized trials <strong>(Class I, Level A)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Peritoneovenous shunt, performed by a surgeon or interventional radiologist experienced with this technique, should be considered for patients with refractory ascites who are not candidates for paracenteses, transplant, or TIPS <strong>(Class IIb, Level A)</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="26">
    <li>Patients with ascites admitted to the hospital should undergo abdominal paracentesis. Paracentesis should be repeated in patients (whether in the hospital or not) who develop signs or symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of infection (e.g., abdominal pain or tenderness, fever, encephalopathy, renal failure, acidosis, or peripheral leukocytosis) <strong>(Class I, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients with ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) counts greater than or equal to 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (0.25 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) in a community-acquired setting in the absence of recent B-lactam antibiotic exposure should receive empiric antibiotic therapy, e.g., an intravenous third-generation cephalosporin, preferably cefotaxime 2 g every 8 hours <strong>(Class I, Level A)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients with ascitic fluid PMN counts greater than or equal to 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (0.25 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) in a nosocomial setting and/or in the presence of recent B-lactam antibiotic exposure should receive empiric antibiotic therapy based on local susceptibility testing of bacteria in patients with cirrhosis <strong>(Class IIa, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Oral ofloxacin (400 mg twice per day) can be considered a substitute for intravenous cefotaxime in inpatients without prior exposure to quinolones, vomiting, shock, grade II (or higher) hepatic encephalopathy, or serum creatinine greater than 3 mg/ dL <strong>(Class IIa, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients with ascitic fluid PMN counts less than 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (0.25 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and signs or symptoms of infection (temperature &gt;100&ordm; F or abdominal pain or tenderness) should also receive empiric antibiotic therapy, e.g., intravenous cefotaxime 2 g every 8 hours, while awaiting results of cultures <strong>(Class I, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>When the ascitic fluid of a patient with cirrhosis is found to have a PMN count greater than or equal to 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (0.25 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and there is high suspicion of secondary peritonitis, it should also be tested for protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose, Gram's stain, carcinoembryonic antigen, and alkaline phosphatase to assist with the distinction of SBP from secondary peritonitis. Computed tomographic scanning should also be performed <strong>(Class IIa, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients with ascitic fluid PMN counts greater than or equal to 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (0.25 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) in a nosocomial setting and/or in the presence of recent B-lactam antibiotic exposure and/or culture an atypical organism(s) or have an atypical clinical response to treatment, should undergo a follow-up paracentesis after 48 hrs of treatment to assess the response in PMN count and culture <strong>(Class IIa, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients with ascitic fluid PMN counts greater than or equal to 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (0.25 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and clinical suspicion of SBP, who also have a serum creatinine &gt;1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen &gt;30 mg/dL, or total bilirubin &gt;4 mg/dL should receive 1.5 g albumin per kg body weight within 6 hours of detection and 1.0 g/kg on day 3 <strong>(Class IIa, Level B)</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prevention of SBP</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="34">
    <li>Intravenous ceftriaxone for 7 days or twice-daily norfloxacin for 7 days should be given to prevent bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage <strong>(Class I, Level A)</strong>. Perhaps parenteral antibiotic, while the patient is bleeding and oral antibiotic after oral intake is resumed, for a total of 7 days, is a practical treatment regimen. </li>
    <li>Patients who have survived an episode of SBP should receive long-term prophylaxis with daily norfloxacin (or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) <strong>(Class I, Level A)</strong>. </li>
    <li>In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, long-term use of norfloxacin (or trimethoprim/sulfamethasoxazole) can be justified if the ascitic fluid protein &lt;1.5 g/dL along with impaired renal function (creatinine &ge;1.2, blood urea nitrogen [BUN] &ge;25 or serum sodium [Na] &le;130) or liver failure (Child score &ge;9 and bilirubin &ge;3) <strong>(Class I, Level A)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Intermittent dosing of antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections may be inferior to daily dosing (due to the development of bacterial resistance) and thus daily dosing should preferentially be used (<strong>Class IIb, Level C</strong>). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hepatorenal Syndrome</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="38">
    <li>Urinary biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin may assist in the differential diagnosis of azotemia in patients with cirrhosis <strong>(Class IIa, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Albumin infusion plus administration of vasoactive drugs such as octreotide and midodrine should be considered in the treatment of type I hepatorenal syndrome <strong>(Class IIa, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Albumin infusion plus administration of norepinephrine should also be considered in the treatment of type I hepatorenal syndrome, when the patient is in the intensive care unit <strong>(Class IIa, Level A)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Patients with cirrhosis, ascites, and type I or type II hepatorenal syndrome should have an expedited referral for liver transplantation <strong>(Class I, Level B)</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Umbilical Hernias in Patients with Cirrhosis and Ascites</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="42">
    <li>The risks versus benefits of hernia repair must be weighed carefully in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Elective repair can be performed during or after liver transplantation <strong>(Class IIa, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Elective repair of a hernia in a patient with cirrhosis is best performed after ascites has been controlled by medical treatment, the patient's overall condition has been optimized, and a multidisciplinary approach with consideration of perioperative TIPS is utilized <strong>(Class IIa, Level C)</strong>. </li>
    <li>Emergent repair of a strangulated or perforated umbilical hernia is best performed by a surgeon who is experienced in the care of patients with cirrhosis <strong>(Class IIa, Level C)</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hepatic Hydrothorax</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="45">
    <li>Chest tube insertion is contraindicated in patients with hepatic hydrothorax <strong>(Class III, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>First-line therapy of hepatic hydrothorax consists of dietary sodium restriction and diuretics <strong>(Class IIa, Level B)</strong>. </li>
    <li>TIPS can be considered as second-line treatment for hepatic hydrothorax, once it becomes refractory <strong>(Class IIb, Level B)</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cellulitis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="48">
    <li>Cellulitis can explain pain and fever in patients with cirrhosis and ascites and should be treated with diuretics and antibiotic(s) <strong>(Class IIb, Level B)</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="49">
    <li>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis and ascites <strong>(Class IIb, Level B)</strong>. </li>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Abdominal paracentesis with appropriate ascitic fluid analysis is probably the most rapid and cost-effective method of diagnosing the cause of ascites. </li>
    <li>The risks and costs of prophylactic transfusions may exceed the benefit. </li>
    <li>In comparing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS) to sequential large-volume paracentesis, one study reports prevention of hepatorenal syndrome but with higher costs in the TIPS group. </li>
    <li>Regular infusions of albumin for treatment of new onset or refractory ascites should be considered experimental until more studies demonstrate efficacy and cost-effectiveness. </li>
    <li>Intravenous ciprofloxacin followed by oral administration of this drug was found to be more cost-effective compared to intravenous ceftazidime in a randomized trial in patients who had not received quinolone prophylaxis. </li>
    <li>Selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in patients with prior spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or low-protein ascitic fluid does appear to be cost-effective. </li>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Complications of abdominal paracentesis have been reported in only about 1% of patients (abdominal wall hematomas), despite the fact that 71% of the patients had an abnormal prothrombin time. Although more serious complications (hemoperitoneum or bowel entry by the paracentesis needle) occur, they are sufficiently unusual (&lt;1/1,000 paracenteses) that they should not deter performance of this procedure. </li>
    <li>The chronic hyponatremia that is usually seen in patients with cirrhotic ascites is seldom morbid. Rapid attempts to correct hyponatremia in this setting can lead to more complications than the hyponatremia itself. </li>
    <li>Patients with parenchymal renal disease (e.g., diabetic nephropathy or immunoglobulin A nephropathy) may tolerate less spironolactone than usual because of hyperkalemia. </li>
    <li>Peritoneovenous shunt placement is associated with poor long-term patency, excessive complications, and no survival advantage compared to medical therapy in controlled trials. </li>
    <li>Clinically significant complications of diuretics include encephalopathy, serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL, serum sodium less than 120 mmol/L, or serum potassium greater than 6.0 mmol/L. </li>
    <li>Propranolol has been shown to shorten survival in patients with refractory ascites. </li>
    <li>Patients with an ejection fraction between 50% and 60% and those with diastolic dysfunction may have a higher risk of post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPS) heart failure and reduced survival. </li>
    <li>Systemic hypotension often complicates the use of beta blockers. Consideration should be given to discontinuing or not initiating these drugs in this setting. </li>
