Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adults 66 years and older who had a medication review during the measurement year.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Electronic and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Electronic specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid specification.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>According to United States (U.S.) Census statistics, there were almost 38 million people over the age of 65 in 2009. The population 85 years of age and older was projected to increase to 5.7 million by 2010&mdash;a 36 percent increase from 2000's total (National Eye Institute [NEI], n.d.). As the elderly population ages, physical function decreases, pain increases and cognitive ability can decrease. Older adults become increasingly depressed or have medication regimens of increased complexity.</p>
<p>The vast majority of older adults take medications to address at least three or more chronic conditions. Many have multiple prescribing physicians and use more than one pharmacy, necessitating regular review of medications. The Task Force on Medications Partnership (2002) recommends that all community-dwelling older adults have a medication review performed at least yearly.</p>
<p>A medication list should include prescriptions and over-the-counter (OTC) medications (including herbals, supplements); dose, frequency, and reason for taking the medication. Poor medication management can lead to adverse drug events, overdoses, and underutilization of drugs, all of which can result in increased hospitalizations (Bikowski, Ripsin, &amp; Lorraine, 2001).</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>All HEDIS measures undergo systematic assessment of face validity with review by measurement advisory panels, expert panels, a formal public comment process and approval by the National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) Committee on Performance Measurement and Board of Directors. Once NCQA establishes national benchmarks for accountable care organization (ACO) performance, all measures will undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomiol statistical analysis. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test.</p></div>
