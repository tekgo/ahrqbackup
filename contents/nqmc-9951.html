<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In a given year, an estimated 20.9 million American adults suffer from a depressive disorder or depression (National Institute of Mental Health, 2006). Without treatment, symptoms associated with these disorders can last for years, or can eventually lead to death by suicide or other causes. Fortunately, many people can improve through treatment with appropriate medications. </p>
<p>According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) (2000), successful treatment of patients with major depressive disorder is promoted by a thorough assessment of the patient and close adherence to treatment plans. Treatment consists of an acute phase, during which remission is induced; a continuation phase, during which remission is preserved; and a maintenance phase, during which the susceptible patient is protected against the recurrence of a subsequent major depressive episode. </p>
<p>When pharmacotherapy is part of the treatment plan, it must be integrated with the psychiatric management and any other treatments that are being provided. Patients who have started taking an antidepressant medication should be carefully monitored to assess their response to pharmacotherapy as well as the emergence of side effects, clinical condition and safety. Factors to consider when determining the frequency of patient monitoring include the severity of illness, the patient's cooperation with treatment, the availability of social supports and the presence of comorbid general medical problems. In practice, the frequency of monitoring during the acute phase of pharmacotherapy can vary from once a week in routine cases to multiple times per week in more complex cases. </p>
<p>Patients who have been treated with antidepressant medications in the acute phase should be maintained on these agents to prevent relapse (APA, 2000).</p></div>

Once NCQA establishes national benchmarks for accountable care organization (ACO) performance, all measures will undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomial statistical analysis. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test.</p></div>
