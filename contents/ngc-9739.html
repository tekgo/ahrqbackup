Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of evidence (<strong>+, ++, +++, ++++</strong>) and the grades of the recommendations (<strong>weak</strong> or <strong>strong</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Adrenalectomy</strong></p>
<p>Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is associated with less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, earlier recovery, and similar long-term outcomes compared with open surgery and has been established as the preferred approach to all non-primary adrenal cancer pathology (<strong>+++, strong</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Adrenalectomy Techniques</strong></p>
<p>Several approaches to laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) have been described in the literature. Surgeons should choose the approach they are most familiar with, have had training in, and have the best patient outcomes with (<strong>+++, strong</strong>).</p>
<p>Surgeons should also take into consideration that in specific clinical circumstances some approaches may be more beneficial than others:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In patients with previous abdominal surgery, a retroperitoneal approach may be associated with less operative time and fewer complications (<strong>++, weak</strong>). </li>
    <li>For bilateral adrenalectomies, the posterior retroperitoneal approach may be advantageous, as it eliminates patient repositioning during the case (<strong>++, weak</strong>). </li>
    <li>In morbidly obese patients (BMI &gt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and for large tumors (&gt;6 cm), the lateral transabdominal approach may increase the feasibility of the procedure compared with the other approaches (<strong>++, weak</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Robotic Adrenalectomy (RA)</strong></p>
<p>Compared with standard laparoscopic techniques, robotic adrenalectomy may offer advantages for large tumors and in morbidly obese patients (<strong>+, weak</strong>). However, given the increased cost, longer operative times, and lack of clear patient outcome benefits using this technique, additional higher quality evidence is needed before a firm recommendation can be provided.</p>
<p><strong>Single Port Adrenalectomy</strong></p>
<p>Based on the available evidence, single port adrenalectomy is feasible and safe when undertaken by an experienced surgeon but offers little if any advantage over other standard laparoscopic approaches to adrenalectomy. Additional, better quality evidence is needed before this approach can be recommended (<strong>+, weak</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Partial Adrenalectomy</strong></p>
<p>Partial adrenalectomy is safe and feasible in the hands of appropriately trained surgeons. For patients requiring bilateral adrenalectomy, such as for hereditary pheochromocytomas, laparoscopic cortical sparing surgery may be the procedure of choice (<strong>++, weak</strong>).</p>
<p>Additional evidence is needed before a recommendation can be provided for partial adrenalectomy of single gland, non-hereditary tumors.</p>
<p><strong>Method and Timing for Taking the Adrenal Vein</strong></p>
<p>The classic teaching for early vein control during open adrenalectomy has not been confirmed for laparoscopic adrenalectomy, because patient outcomes do not appear to be affected by early versus late ligation. Thus, the type and timing of adrenal vein control depends on surgeon preference and the specific anatomic variables associated with each case (<strong>+, weak</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy for Suspected or Proven Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma and Adrenal Metastases</strong></p>
<p>For adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC), the best determinant of patient outcomes is an appropriate oncologic resection that includes <em>en bloc</em> resection of any contiguous involved structures and regional lymphadenectomy. Thus, an open approach to resection may be best. If a laparoscopic approach is chosen (due to unknown malignancy status preoperatively or suspected early stage ACC), conversion to open surgery is strongly recommended when difficult dissection is encountered due to tumor adhesion or invasion or enlarged lymph nodes are seen (<strong>++, strong</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Adrenal Metastases</strong></p>
<p>Solitary metastases to the adrenal gland without evidence of local invasion can be approached laparoscopically by a surgeon skilled in advanced laparoscopy and adrenal surgery (<strong>+, weak</strong>). If local invasion is found intraoperatively, conversion to an open approach is warranted (<strong>+, strong</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy in Large Adrenal Masses</strong></p>
<p>Large adrenal tumors without pre- or intraoperative evidence of primary adrenal cortical carcinoma can be approached laparoscopically by a surgeon skilled in advanced laparoscopy and adrenal surgery (<strong>+, weak</strong>). Laparoscopic adrenalectomy for larger tumors may be associated with increased operating room times, blood loss, and conversion rate to open surgery (<strong>+, weak</strong>). If there is any evidence for carcinoma found intraoperatively, conversion to an open approach is warranted (should be strongly considered) (<strong>+, strong</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Pheochromocytoma</strong></p>
<p><em>Preoperative Care</em></p>
<p>Before laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma, alpha adrenergic receptor blockade should be considered in all patients. When used preoperatively, alpha blockade should be continued until signs of orthostatic hypotension are evident (<strong>+++, weak</strong>). Short acting alpha blockers may be preferable to long acting ones. Beta blockade should also be considered in appropriately selected patients and should only be instituted following adequate alpha blockade (<strong>++, weak</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Intraoperative Management</em></p>
<p>Invasive hemodynamic monitoring should be considered during LA for pheochromocytomas (<strong>++, strong</strong>). To minimize hemodynamic instability due to catecholamine release during surgery, minimization of direct manipulation or compression of the adrenal gland is necessary (<strong>++, strong</strong>). Early ligation of the vein does not prevent hemodynamic instability (<strong>+, weak</strong>). Due to the added challenge of intraoperative hemodynamic variability, frequent communication between the surgical and anesthesia teams is important for optimal perioperative outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Postoperative Management</em></p>
<p>Due to the potential for hemodynamic instability after pheochromocytoma resection, all patients should be closely monitored in the early postoperative phase (<strong>++, strong</strong>). Capsular disruptions of the adrenal gland during surgery should be avoided to minimize the risk of disease recurrence. (<strong>+, weak)</strong>. Given the lack of clear predictors of malignancy to detect recurrences, patients with pheochromocytoma should be monitored long term with blood pressure measurements and serum and/or urinary metanephrine levels (<strong>++, strong</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Learning Curve</strong></p>
<p>Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is associated with a learning curve that may be difficult to overcome given the paucity of these cases in general practice. Dedicated, advanced training should be pursued by surgeons unfamiliar with this technique. Until proficiency with laparoscopic adrenalectomy is attained, consideration should be given to referral to a center with expertise in minimally-invasive adrenal surgery (<strong>++, strong</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Both the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation for each of the guidelines were assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.* There is a 4-tiered system for quality of evidence:</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>A systematic literature search was performed on MEDLINE in April 2011. The search strategy was limited to adult English language articles (shown in Figure 1 in the original document).</p>
<p>The literature search identified 79 relevant articles. The abstracts were reviewed by four committee members and divided into the following categories:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Randomized studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews </li>
    <li>Prospective studies </li>
    <li>Retrospective studies </li>
    <li>Case reports </li>
    <li>Review articles </li>
</ul>
<p>Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were selected for further review along with prospective and retrospective studies when a higher level of evidence was lacking. For inclusion, prospective and retrospective studies had to report outcomes on at least 50 adrenalectomies. Studies with smaller samples were considered when additional evidence was lacking. The most recent reviews were also included. All case reports, old reviews, and smaller studies were excluded. Duplicate publications or patient populations were considered only once. Whenever the available evidence from Level I studies was considered to be adequate, lower evidence level studies were not considered. Newer relevant articles that were published after the original literature search date during the drafting of this guideline were also included. According to these exclusion criteria, 70 articles were selected for review.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Appropriate use of minimally invasive techniques for the treatment of adrenal disease </li>
    <li>Comparative studies with other laparoscopic approaches have demonstrated a small yet significant benefit in pain medication requirement, time to oral intake, length of hospital stay, and overall convalescence for posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (PRA) </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Typically, the lateral retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy procedure has slightly longer operating times and requires more ports than laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) or posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (PRA) </li>
    <li>Robotic adrenalectomy includes increased cost, longer operative times, and lack of clear patient outcome benefits. </li>
    <li>LA of large tumors has been shown to be an independent risk factor for longer operating times, more blood loss, longer hospital stay, and a higher conversion rate to open surgery </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pheochromocytoma Resection</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In addition to the problems associated with catecholamine liberation, large size and prominent vascularity compound the challenges of removing pheochromocytomas. Compared with other indications for adrenalectomy, both laparoscopic and open resection of pheochromocytomas has been associated with longer operative times, higher complication rates, greater blood loss <br />
    and longer hospitalization. </li>
    <li>In general, these tumors tend to be larger than other functional and nonfunctional adrenal lesions and often have a large number of arterial and venous tributaries that bleed with minimal manipulation. The renal vessels must be carefully identified and protected to avoid inadvertent injury during dissection. </li>
    <li>Intraoperative hypertension and hypotension can occur during intraoperative management, leading to hemodynamic instability. </li>
