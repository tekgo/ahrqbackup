Description

<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of women age 21 years&nbsp;and older screened for cervical cancer&nbsp;in accordance with evidence-based standards:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>One screening Pap test in the measurement year or two years prior for women ages 24 to 64 and no history of hysterectomy </li>
    <li>No screening Pap test in the measurement year for women ages 65 and older, or women ages 24 and older with history of hysterectomy </li>
</ul>
<p>Not screened:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>No screening Pap test in the measurement year or two years prior for women ages 24 to 64 and no history of hysterectomy </li>
</ul>
<p>Screened more frequently:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Two or more screening Pap tests in the measurement year or two years prior for women ages 24 to 64 and no history of hysterectomy </li>
    <li>One or more screening Pap tests in the measurement year for women ages 65 and older </li>
    <li>One or more screening Pap tests for women ages 24 and older with history of hysterectomy </li>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Due to a 3 year look-back period, this measure includes screening for all women ages 21 and older.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Multiple studies indicate that over 50% of cervical cancers occur in women who have never been screened. At the same time, many women are screened for cervical cancer more frequently than is supported by the evidence, resulting in significant unnecessary health care expenditures and patient inconvenience. Therefore, it is this population that the guideline is intended to impact the greatest. Significant risk factors for cervical cancer are failure to be screened on a regular basis and a previously abnormal Pap test within the last five years.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Screening need not be performed for women who have had a hysterectomy for benign disease, provided they have no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or CIN 3. </li>
    <li>Women with a history of CIN 2/3 prior to but not as the indication for hysterectomy should be screened until three consecutive, technically satisfactory normal/negative vaginal cytology tests with no abnormal/positive cytology test within a ten-year period are achieved. </li>
    <li>Initially all women should have annual Pap test screening beginning at age 21 or at three years after the onset of sexual activity. </li>
    <li>It is appropriate to resume Pap test screening in a woman age 65 and older who has a new sexual partner. </li>
    <li>After three consecutive normal Pap tests, and no dysplasia within the last five years, women may have their screening performed less frequently at the discretion of the clinician and patient. </li>
</ul></div>
