Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of recommendation (<strong>Level A, Level B, Level C</strong>) is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions and Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>First-line therapies for women with symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) include nonhormonal lubricants with intercourse and, if indicated, regular use of long-acting vaginal moisturizers. [<strong>Level A</strong>] </li>
    <li>For symptomatic women with moderate to severe VVA and for those with milder VVA who do not respond to lubricants and moisturizers, estrogen therapy (ET) either vaginally at low dose or systemically remains the therapeutic standard. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is preferred when VVA is the only menopausal symptom. [<strong>Level A</strong>] </li>
    <li>Ospemifene is another option for dyspareunia. [<strong>Level A</strong>] </li>
    <li>For women with a history of breast or endometrial cancer, management depends on a woman's preference, need, understanding of potential risks, and consultation with her oncologist. [<strong>Level C</strong>] </li>
    <li>ET carries a class effect risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Low-dose vaginal estrogen may carry a very low risk, but there has been no report of an increased risk in the vaginal estrogen clinical trials. Data in high-risk women are lacking. [<strong>Level C</strong>] </li>
    <li>A progestogen is generally not indicated when low-dose vaginal estrogen is administered for symptomatic VVA. Endometrial safety data are not available for use longer than 1 year. [<strong>Level B</strong>] </li>
    <li>If a woman is at high risk of endometrial cancer or is using a higher dose of vaginal ET, transvaginal ultrasound or intermittent progestogen therapy may be considered. There are insufficient data to recommend routine annual endometrial surveillance in asymptomatic women using vaginal ET. [<strong>Level C</strong>] </li>
    <li>Spotting or bleeding in a postmenopausal woman who has an intact uterus requires a thorough evaluation that may include transvaginal ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy. [<strong>Level A</strong>] </li>
    <li>For women treated for non-hormone-dependent cancer, management of VVA is similar to that for women without a cancer history. [<strong>Level B</strong>] </li>
    <li>Vaginal ET or ospemifene, with appropriate clinical surveillance, can be continued as long as bothersome symptoms are present. [<strong>Level C</strong>] </li>
    <li>Proactive education on vaginal health is recommended for postmenopausal women. [<strong>Level C</strong>] </li>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Because there are no published reports on the irritation potential of different over-the-counter (OTC) vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, women can test these on a small patch of skin for 24 hours before using them intravaginally. If the product they test successfully on the skin still causes irritation in the vagina, they can switch products to the iso-osmolar, propylene glycol-free, or silicone-based lubricants (see Table 1 in the original guideline for brand names). Note that oil-based lubricants can erode condoms; however, most brands of water-based and silicone-based lubricants are latex safe and condom compatible. </li>
    <li>All government-approved, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy (ET) products in the United States and Canada differ slightly in their adverse event profiles. However, the dosing and the symptoms captured differed among the products tested. Vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal bleeding, and breast pain have been reported. The incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis in postmenopausal women is largely unstudied, but studies suggest that women who experience spontaneous menopause and use vaginal ET may be at higher risk. A 2006 Cochrane review found no report of increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but data for women at high risk of VTE are lacking. Vaginal bleeding, breast pain, and nausea have been reported in some vaginal estrogen trials. These symptoms are dose related and suggest that the dose was large enough to result in noteworthy systemic absorption. </li>
    <li>The primary concern regarding use of any ET in women who have an intact uterus is the risk of endometrial carcinoma associated with unopposed estrogen. Although available evidence suggests that low doses of vaginal estrogen are generally safe for the endometrium, the long-term data are limited. </li>
    <li>The concern for women at risk of VTE or breast cancer is systemic absorption of estrogen. Most studies measuring systemic estradiol in vaginal estrogen users were done before 2007. Studies of circulating estradiol since that time also have reported an increase in circulating estrogen, but the clinical relevance of the small increases remains unclear. There could be a growth-promoting effect or an apoptotic effect on breast cancer, depending on the circumstances, and there could even be a small beneficial effect on bone. </li>
    <li>Because the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is based on their ability to reduce estrogen levels below those typically seen in postmenopausal women, even the small increases in circulating estrogen levels seen with low-dose vaginal ETs may render AI therapy less effective. </li>
    <li>Systemic hormone therapy (HT) has been associated with an increase in stress incontinence and renal stones. </li>
    <li>In one study of ospemifene, vasomotor symptoms were the most common adverse event, with rates of 2% in the placebo group and 7.2% in the group taking 60 mg of ospemifene. The prescribing information for ospemifene contains precautions similar to those listed for estrogens and other selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), such as class labeling for risk of VTE. With regard to breast cancer, it is stated that ospemifene should not be used in women with breast cancer or at high risk for breast cancer because the drug has not been adequately studied in that group. Ospemifene has, however, demonstrated antiestrogenic activity in preclinical models of breast cancer. Data in women with or at risk for breast cancer are lacking. </li>

<h3>
Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Although most symptomatic women are candidates for vaginal estrogen therapy (ET), potential contraindications exist. Vaginal ET is inappropriate for postmenopausal women with undiagnosed vaginal/uterine bleeding and controversial in women with estrogen-dependent neoplasia (e.g., breast, endometrial). Comanagement with the woman's oncologist may be considered in the case of estrogen-dependent neoplasia. The role of low-dose vaginal ET in women at increased risk of thrombosis has not been studied.</p></div>
