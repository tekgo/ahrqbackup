Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of in-hospital deaths per 1,000 discharges with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, ages 18 years and older. </p>
<p>The indicator is stratified into four groups by 1) type of AAA repair (open vs. endovascular) and 2) AAA rupture status. </p>
<p>Cases are assigned to strata according to a hierarchy based on mortality, with cases being assigned to the stratum with the highest mortality for which the case qualifies. In the case of AAA Repair Mortality the current hierarchy is as follows: </p>
<p>Strata hierarchy (listed from highest mortality to lowest mortality): </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Stratum A (Open repair of ruptured AAA) </li>
    <li>Stratum C (Endovascular repair of ruptured AAA) </li>
    <li>Stratum B (Open repair of unruptured AAA) </li>
    <li>Stratum D (Endovascular repair of unruptured AAA) </li>
</ol>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is a relatively rare procedure that requires proficiency with the use of complex equipment; and technical errors may lead to clinically significant complications, such as arrhythmias, acute myocardial infarction, colonic ischemia, and death. Better processes of care may reduce mortality for AAA repair, which represents better quality care.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 2007 State Inpatient Databases (SID) with 4,000 hospitals and 30 million adult discharges. </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Literature summary, expert panels and empirical analysis.</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. The relatively small number of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) resections performed by each hospital suggests that mortality rates at the hospital level are likely to be unreliable. Empirical evidence shows that this indicator is precise, with a raw provider level mean of 21.5% and a substantial standard deviation of 26.8% ("Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [HCUP] Nationwide Inpatient Sample and State 88 Databases," n.d.). </p>
<p>Relative to other indicators, a higher percentage of the variation occurs at the provider level, rather than the discharge level. The signal ratio (i.e., the proportion of the total variation across providers that is truly related to systematic differences in provider performance rather than random variation) is low, at 30.7%, indicating that some of the observed differences in provider performance.</p>
<p>The signal to noise ratio is the ratio of the between hospital variance (signal) to the within hospital variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). The ratio itself is only a diagnostic for the degree of variance in the risk-adjusted rate systematically associated with the provider. Therefore, what matters is the magnitude of the variance in the "smoothed" rate (that is, the variance in the risk-adjusted rate after the application of the univariate shrinkage estimator based on the signal ratio). What the data demonstrate is systematic variation in the provider level rate of 2.6 to 7.6 per 100 from the 5th to 95th percentile after a signal ratio of 0.307 is applied as the shrinkage estimator (that is, after accounting for variation due to random factors). An additional technique applied to the indicator is the use of multivariate signal extraction (an extension of univariate shrinkage estimator) to increase effective sample size to the extent that individual measures are correlated (Staiger et. al., 2009).</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. AHRQ 2007 SID with 4,000 hospitals and 30 million adult discharges.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence shows that AAA repair mortality is positively related to other post-procedural mortality measures, such as craniotomy (r=.28, p less than .0001) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (r=.17, p less than .01) ("HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample," n.d.).</p>
<p>Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs); and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) versus non-VA (Nationwide Inpatient Sample) using VA inpatient data (2004 to 2007) (Pearce et al., 1999). </p>
<p>A survey of hospital and system leaders (presidents/chief executive officers [CEOs]) that was conducted in the first six months of 2006 with a total of 562 respondents. Hospital-level data for these composite measures were produced by applying the Inpatient Quality Indicator (IQI) to the SID of the HCUP sponsored by AHRQ. The SID includes all-payer data on inpatient stays from virtually all community hospitals in each participating state (Rutledge et al., 1996).</p>
<p>The developer used 100 percent national analytic files from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the calendar years 2003 through 2006. Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) files, which contain hospital discharge abstracts for all fee-for-service acute care hospitalizations of all U.S. Medicare recipients, were used to create our main analytical datasets. The Medicare denominator file was used to assess patient vital status at 30 days. Using appropriate procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, version 9 (ICD-9 codes), the developer identified all patients aged 65 to 99 undergoing elective AAA repair and pancreatectomy (Pilcher et al., 1980).</p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Literature summary, expert panels and empirical analysis </p>
<p>VA- and VISN-level IQI observed rates, risk-adjusted rates, and observed to expected ratios (O/Es). The developer examined the trends in VA- and VISN-level rates using weighted linear regression, variation in VISN-level O/Es, and compared VA to non-VA trends (Pearce et al., 1999).</p>
<p>A t-test was used to determine the significance of differences in quality measures (Rutledge et al., 1996). </p>
<p>The developer first estimated risk-adjusted hospital mortality rates during 2003 to 2004. Mortality was defined as death within 30 days of operation or before hospital discharge. Patient age, gender, race, urgency of operation, median ZIP-code income, and coexisting medical conditions was adjusted for. Using logistic regression, the expected number of deaths in each hospital was estimated and then divided the observed deaths by this expected number of deaths to obtain the ratio of observed to expected mortality (O/E ratio). The developer then multiplied the O/E ratio by the average mortality rate to obtain a risk-adjusted mortality rate for each hospital. Next a hierarchical modeling techniques was used to adjust these mortality estimates for reliability. Using random effects logistic regression models, empirical Bayes predictions of mortality for each hospital were generated (Pilcher et al., 1980).</p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. The correlation between hospital or physician characteristics and in-hospital mortality in most studies supports the validity of in-hospital mortality as a measure of quality (Pearce et al., 1999; Rutledge et al., 1996). Finally, excessive blood loss, which is a potentially preventable complication of surgery, has been identified as the most important predictor of mortality after elective AAA repair (Pilcher et al., 1980). Empirical evidence shows that AAA repair mortality is positively related to other post-procedural mortality measures, such as craniotomy (r=.28, p less than .0001) and CABG (r=.17, p less than .01). </p>

The reference population used in the model is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) for the year 2008 (updated annually), a database consisting of 43 states and approximately 30 million adult discharges and 4,000 hospitals.
