<div class="content_para"><p>The evidence grades (<strong>A-D, X</strong>) and evidence-based statements (<strong>Strong Recommendation, Recommendation, Option, and No Recommendations</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Statement 1. Baseline Voice Assessment</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should document assessment of the patient's voice once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Establish a baseline, improve the detection of preexisting voice impairment, establish expectations about voice outcomes, educating the patient, facilitates shared decision making, prioritize the need for preoperative laryngeal assessment and more in-depth voice assessment </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Anxiety, cost of assessment tool, patient and provider time </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Perception by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) of a current underassessment of voice prior to surgery </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The proximity of the assessment to the day of surgery is not specified because there was no consensus among the guideline group and there were no data to support the choice of one time point over another. The group agreed that any change in voice would warrant a new assessment. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Selection of assessment methods </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 2A. Preoperative Laryngeal Assessment of the Impaired Voice</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should examine vocal fold mobility, or refer the patient to a clinician who can examine vocal fold mobility, if the patient's voice is impaired (as determined by the assessment in Statement 1) and a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Assess mobility of vocal fold, potential diagnosis of invasive thyroid cancer, influence the decision for surgery, extent of surgery, intraoperative technique, preoperative patient counseling, distinguish iatrogenic from disease related paralysis/paresis </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Misdiagnosis (false positive/false negative), cost of examination, patient discomfort, resources, access, anxiety </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Limited </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 2B. Preoperative Laryngeal Assessment of the Nonimpaired Voice</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should examine vocal fold mobility, or refer the patient to a clinician who can examine vocal fold mobility, if the patient's voice is normal and the patient has (a) thyroid cancer with suspected extrathyroidal extension, or (b) prior neck surgery that increases the risk of laryngeal nerve injury (carotid endarterectomy, anterior approach to the cervical spine, cervical esophagectomy, and prior thyroid or parathyroid surgery), or (c) both, once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Assess mobility of vocal fold, potential diagnosis of invasive thyroid cancer, influence the decision for surgery, extent of surgery, intraoperative technique, preoperative patient counseling, distinguish iatrogenic from disease related paralysis/paresis </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Misdiagnosis (false positive/false negative), cost of examination, patient discomfort, resources, access, anxiety </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Even though the prevalence of preoperative vocal fold paresis is low, the consequence of not knowing this prior to surgery could result in substantial morbidity or mortality. For this reason, the GDG was willing to accept a large number of normal examinations in return for an occasional abnormal finding. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The timing of assessment relative to surgery is not stated to allow clinicians flexibility in decision making, although the GDG agreed that the assessment should take place as close to the surgery as possible. The word suspected is used due to the difficulty of identifying extrathyroidal extension through physical exam and imaging. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Limited </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 3. Patient Education on Voice Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The clinician should educate the patient about the potential impact of thyroid surgery on voice once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span> based on preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>

    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the value of patient education in general regarding surgery; Grade C, studies on the incidence of voice impairment following thyroid surgery in particular </li>
    <li>Benefit: Facilitate shared decision making, establish realistic expectations, help patients recognize voice changes postoperatively </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: Anxiety </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: Generalize evidence about the benefits of patient education to this circumstance </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: None </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: Patient can decline information </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 4. Communication With Anesthesiologist</strong></p>
<p>The surgeon should inform the anesthesiologist of the results of abnormal preoperative laryngeal assessment in patients who have had laryngoscopy prior to thyroid surgery.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation</span> based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.</em></p>
<p><em>Action Statement Profile</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C </li>
    <li>Benefit: Allow anesthesiologist to select proper tube, allow anesthesiologist to optimize airway management, identify potential problems with intubation and extubation, plan postoperative care and monitoring, may prevent anesthetic related voice disturbance </li>
    <li>Risk, harm, cost: None </li>
    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: The GDG felt that even though the recommendation followed best practice there was a perception the action was not universally performed. </li>

    <li>Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit </li>
    <li>Value judgments: None </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The steps taken to preserve the nerve are purposefully not specified in the statement to emphasize the important issue is preserving the nerve, which may or may not be identifiable during surgery. Therefore, it is the attention to the nerve that is important. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: None </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statement 7. Intraoperative Electromyography (EMG) Monitoring</strong></p>

    <li>Value judgments: The GDG believes that postoperative voice assessment is not being performed universally, in the identified time frame. </li>
    <li>Intentional vagueness: The documentation time is stated as between 2 weeks and 2 months because there is no evidence on the optimal time, but the GDG suggests that the evaluation should be late enough to overcome transient postoperative changes but early enough to allow effective intervention. </li>
    <li>Role of patient preferences: No role in documenting the outcome, but a significant role in the choice and extent of outcome assessment </li>
    <li>Exclusions: None </li>
    <li>Policy level: Recommendation </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>All literature searches were performed by an information specialist through January 2012. Three initial searches were performed to identify clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The searches were performed in multiple databases including the <a href="http://www.guideline.gov" title="NGC Web site" target="_blank">National Guideline Clearinghouse</a> (NGC), the Cochrane Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, BIOSIS, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CMA Infobase, National Health Service (NHS) Evidence ENT and Audiology, National Library of Guidelines, National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), New Zealand Guidelines Group (NZGG), Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (ANHMRC), and the TRIP database.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Clinical practice guidelines were identified by a PubMed, NGC, CMA Infobase, NHS Evidence, NZGG, ANHMRC, TRIP database, and the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N) library search using guideline as a publication type or title word. The search identified 7 guidelines after removing duplicates, clearly irrelevant references, and non&ndash;English language articles. </li>
    <li>Systematic reviews were identified through Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ), and the TRIP database. The final data set included 50 systematic reviews or meta-analyses that were distributed to the panel members. Articles were excluded if they were not available in English and did not meet the panels' quality criteria, namely, the review had a clear objective and method, an explicit search strategy, and a valid method of data extraction. </li>
    <li>RCTs were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL and totaled 285 trials. </li>
</ol>
<p>Results of all literature searches were distributed to guideline panel members including electronic listings with abstracts (if available) of the searches for clinical guidelines, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and other studies. This material was supplemented, as needed, with targeted searches to address specific needs identified in writing the guideline through May 2012.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The evidence-based approach to guideline development requires that the evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and statements be defined. Evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the statement is followed. The definitions for evidence-based statements are listed in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields. As much of the guideline dealt with evidence relating to diagnostic tests, the definitions for Evidence Quality for Grades of Evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field) was adapted to include current recommendations from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was developed using an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm. The guideline development panel was comprised of representatives from the fields of otolaryngology, laryngology, head and neck surgery, nursing, speech-language pathology, endocrinology, internal medicine, general surgery, anesthesiology, and consumer advocacy.</p>
<p>In a series of conference calls, the working group defined the scope and objectives of the proposed guideline. During the 12 months devoted to guideline development, the guideline development group met twice, with in-person meetings following the format previously described, using electronic decision support (BRIDGE-Wiz, Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) software to facilitate creating actionable recommendations and evidence profiles. Internal electronic review and feedback on each guideline draft was used to ensure accuracy of content and consistency with standardized criteria for reporting clinical practice guidelines.</p>
<p>American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) staff used the Guideline Implementability Appraisal and Extractor (GLIA) to appraise adherence of the draft guideline to methodological standards, improve clarity of recommendations, and predict potential obstacles to implementation. Guideline panel members received summary appraisals in May 2012 and modified an advanced draft of the guideline.</p></div>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This guideline is intended to focus on quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the guideline development group (GDG). It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide for managing patients undergoing thyroid surgery. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, regardless of discipline, to improve quality of care and voice outcomes. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based on the assessment of individual patients. </li>
    <li>Guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a "strong recommendation" than might be expected with&nbsp;"recommendation." "Options" offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. They must also operate within their scope of practice and according to their training. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. </li>
    <li>This clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing voice outcomes after thyroid surgery. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions, but they are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates and do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible physician, in lights of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology&mdash;Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), Inc. emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care, or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. </li>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Implementation Considerations</strong></p>
<p>The clinical practice guideline is published as a supplement to <em>Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em>, which will facilitate reference and distribution. A full-text version of the guideline will be accessible, free of charge, at <a href="http://www.entnet.org" title="AAO-HNSF Web site">http://www.entnet.org</a>. In addition, all the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guidelines are now available via the <em>Otolaryngology&ndash;Head and Neck Surgery</em> app for smartphones and tablets. The guideline will be presented to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery members as a miniseminar at the AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting &amp; OTO EXPO. Existing brochures and publication by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline's recommendations. </p>
<p>As a supplement to clinicians, an algorithm of the guideline's action statements has been provided (see Figure 5 in the original guideline document). The algorithm allows for a more rapid understanding of the guideline's logic and the sequence of the action statements. The guideline development group hopes the algorithm can be adopted as a quick reference guide to support the implementation of the guideline's recommendations.</p>
<p>To support clinicians' adoption of Key Action Statement 3 (see the "Major Recommendations" field), patient education of voice outcomes, a set of discussion points has been developed (see Table 7 in the original guideline document). The table highlights key points to be discussed with the patient both pre- and postoperatively. Specifically, the surgeon should discuss possible surgical risks and their relation to voice outcomes and any potential benefits. The guideline development group (GDG) recommends these materials can be incorporated into future educational materials.</p>
<p>To assist readers of the guideline who may be unfamiliar with the anatomy of the thyroid, several diagrams have been provided in the original guideline document. The diagrams identify the location of the thyroid gland and the position of both the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) and the recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLN).</p></div>

<p>The cost of developing this guideline, including travel expenses of all panel members, was covered in full by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they: (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Lastly, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established "stake" in an issue.</p>
