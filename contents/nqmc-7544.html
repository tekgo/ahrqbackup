<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients/parents who received education regarding immunizations.</p>
<p>Vaccines are one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century. Before vaccines became widely used, infectious diseases killed thousands of children and adults each year in the United States.</p>
<p>For most Americans today, vaccines are a routine part of health care, yet pockets of vaccine-preventable diseases occur. This is partly related to a growing number of parents who are concerned that vaccines may be the cause of conditions such as autism or question whether vaccines are still necessary. These concerns have caused some parents to delay vaccines or withhold them altogether from their children.</p>
<p>Vaccine recommendations are determined after extensive studies in large clinical trials. They include studies on how vaccine recipients respond to multiple vaccines given simultaneously. The overall aim is to provide early protection for infants and children against vaccine-preventable diseases that could endanger their health and life. No scientific evidence exists to support that delaying vaccinations or separating them into individual antigens is beneficial for children. Rather, this practice prolongs susceptibility to disease, which could result in a greater likelihood of the child becoming sick with a serious or life-threatening disease. There could also be added expense (e.g., multiple office visits), additional time off from work for parents, and increased likelihood that the child will fail to get all necessary vaccinations.</p>
<p>To combat these threats, health care providers need to continue to encourage patients and parents to receive all recommended immunizations and to follow the scientifically based immunization schedules.</p>
<p>Providers should discuss with the patient the benefits of vaccines, the diseases that the vaccines prevent, and any known risks from vaccines. These issues should be discussed in the patient's native language, whenever possible. Printed materials, accurately translated into the patient's language, should be provided. For most commonly used vaccines, the U.S. federal government has developed Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) to give to potential vaccine recipients. Ample time should be allotted with patients, parents/guardians to review written materials and address questions and concerns.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In the past decade, the U.S. has seen an increase in the number of cases of pertussis and measles. In 2002, 9,771 cases of pertussis were reported. In 2010, more than 27,000 cases were reported with 36 deaths. In California, 10 infants aged two months and younger died from pertussis. Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. However, importations of measles from other countries still occur, and low vaccination coverage associated with parental concerns regarding the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine puts persons and communities at risk for measles. More than 200 cases of measles were reported in the U.S. in 2011, with outbreaks seen in many states. Between March and September of 2011, 26 cases of measles (two outbreaks) were identified in two Minnesota counties (Hennepin and Dakota). Both outbreaks were linked to children who had acquired the infection in Kenya. </li>
    <li>Our increasingly mobile world provides continued threats of importation of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles. In 2011, more than 30,000 cases of measles were reported in Europe and more than 128,000 cases in Africa. </li>
    <li>Pertussis appears to be endemic in middle and high schools. Although mortality is very low in patients ages 11 to 65 years, pertussis causes substantial morbidity in this age as well as transmission to incompletely immunized infants. </li>
    <li>Human papillomavirus (HPV) currently affects about 20 million Americans and has been associated with cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile and anal cancers in addition to cancers of the head and neck. Of the cancers associated with HPV, cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women, and head and neck are the most common cancers occurring in men. </li>
    <li>HPV is the cause of invasive cervical cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes cervical cancer as the first cancer 100% attributable to infection, with the prevalence of HPV DNA in cervical cancer biopsies from 22 countries at 99.7%. Receiving the HPV vaccine does not change the current recommendations for cervical cancer screening (Pap tests). </li>
    <li>A household contact study examining varicella transmissions concludes that the varicella vaccine is effective in preventing moderate and severe disease and 80% effective in preventing all disease. </li>
    <li>A study conducted on children aged 2 to 17 years from 1995 to 2000 has shown that vaccination decreased hepatitis A incidence. </li>
