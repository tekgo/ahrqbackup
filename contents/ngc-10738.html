<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The management of a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) should be individualized and may sometimes need to be discussed at a multidisciplinary Tumour Board. </li>
    <li>The management of a MPE is palliative and therefore all treatment decisions should consider the type of malignancy (e.g., lung versus ovarian), patients' symptoms, life expectancy, functional status, quality of life, and goals of therapy.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>Palliative therapy goals should improve patients' quality of life through:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Relief of dyspnea </li>
            <li>The need for reintervention </li>
            <li>Reduced hospitalizations and length of stay </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnostic and Baseline Investigations</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>All patients with a suspected MPE should have an initial clinical history and physical examination. An MPE should be considered as a cause of breathlessness in patients with diagnosed cancer. </li>
    <li>A chest radiograph should be used to detect the presence of a pleural effusion. A lateral decubitus chest radiograph may be used to differentiate pleural liquid from pleural thickening. </li>
    <li>Computerized tomography (CT) scans, when clinically indicated, can detect very small pleural effusions (less than 10 mL of fluid); intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material is recommended. A thoracic ultrasound can also be used to investigate small pleural effusions. </li>
    <li>Undiagnosed effusions of more than 1 cm from the chest wall on a lateral decubitus chest radiograph should be diagnostically evaluated by ultrasound-assisted thoracentesis. Patients known to have advanced cancer do not need thoracentesis for small asymptomatic effusions. </li>
    <li>If a thoracentesis is going to be performed, all effusions should be sent for cytology if a patient does not have a diagnosis of a MPE.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="a">
        <li>A minimum 50mL to 60 mL of pleural fluid should be withdrawn for analysis. </li>
        <li>The fluid should be analyzed for cell count and differential, gram stain and culture, pH, and glucose, as well as protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which can help to ascertain whether the fluid is a transudate or an exudate using Light's Criteria. </li>
        <li>Consider sending larger volumes of fluid (100 mL to 200 mL) for cell block and molecular testing (e.g., <em>epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]</em>). </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>All patients with a diagnosed MPE should be referred to respiratory medicine or thoracic surgery although initial thoracentesis should not be delayed in symptomatic patients. In Edmonton, referrals can be made to the Alberta Thoracic Oncology Program, and in Calgary/Southern Alberta, to the Tom Baker Cancer Centre Dyspnea clinic. </li>
    <li>Availability of clinical resources should allow rapid assessment (within 1 week) of referred patient in order to avoid unnecessary emergency room visits and hospitalizations. </li>
    <li>Chest ultrasonography, if available, is recommended at the point of care for any thoracentesis or percutaneous chest drain placement (including indwelling pleural catheter [IPC]). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Asymptomatic Patients</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="11">
    <li>Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment but should be observed as MPEs may become symptomatic and require palliative treatment. Patients with a large MPE may be considered for a therapeutic thoracentesis. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Symptomatic Patients</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="12">
    <li>Patients with symptoms may be considered for an initial therapeutic thoracentesis to relieve symptoms prior to further invasive treatments. The recommended total amount of fluid removed per session is 1000 mL to 1500 mL although clinician judgment may be used to remove more if chest symptoms and/or pleural pressure are monitored. In some cases significantly less fluid should be removed if the patient develops chest discomfort or tightness during drainage or if pleural pressures decrease below -20 cmH<sub>2</sub>0. The rate of reaccumulation of the pleural effusion, the patient's clinical and symptomatic response, and prognosis will help to guide the subsequent choice of therapy. </li>
    <li>Outpatient therapeutic thoracentesis alone may occasionally be indicated for patients with a prognosis less than 1 month, and/or a poor performance status (PS), and/or a slow reaccumulation of the pleural effusion (i.e., more than 1 month) and should be performed as required to control symptoms. </li>
    <li>Patients should be considered for more definitive interventions after the first or second thoracentesis. Treatment options include:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>Indwelling (i.e., tunneled) pleural catheter
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Consider for patients with trapped lung who experience at least partial symptom relief following thoracentesis, or those with a shorter anticipated survival</li>
            <li>Consider for any patient with a preference to avoid hospitalization and initial discomfort of pleurodesis</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Talc pleurodesis via thoracoscopy:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Consider for patients with a longer anticipated survival</li>
            <li>Consider if patient does not want indwelling catheter for lifestyle reasons</li>
            <li>Contraindicated for patients with an irremediably entrapped or trapped lung</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Talc pleurodesis via chest tube:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Indicated for patients with a longer anticipated survival or contraindication to thoracoscopy</li>
            <li>Contraindicated for patients with an irremediably entrapped or trapped lung</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The source of talc should be taken into consideration when selecting a treatment option. In Alberta, uncertainty with currently available talc preparations has resulted in more frequent use of IPCs. </li>
    <li>Chemotherapy may be considered as an adjunct treatment option. In particular, patients undergoing first line systemic treatment for tumours with typically rapid response rates (e.g., small cell lung cancer and lymphoma) may avoid the above definitive treatments. </li>
    <li>Coordination with a palliative care team is recommended for patients with incomplete response to initial treatment. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow-up</span></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="18">
    <li>All patients treated with an IPC should be managed and followed-up in the context of a specialist clinic, where accessible, such as the Dyspnea Clinic (Calgary) or Alberta Thoracic Oncology Program (ATOP) (Edmonton). </li>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Development and Revision History</strong></span></p>
<p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Lung Tumour Team with input from members of the Respiratory Health Strategic Clinical Network. Members of the Alberta Provincial Lung Tumour Team include medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgical oncologists, respirologists, nurses, pathologists, and pharmacists. Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Lung Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents' field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formulating Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulate the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the KM Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the GURU Handbook, the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the GURU does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A recent cost-effectiveness analysis of managing malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) found that indwelling pleural catheterization (IPC) was the most cost-effective and least expensive option overall in comparison to thoracentesis and pleurodesis, although cost was dependent on the patient's length of survival. For patients with longer survival, pleurodesis was the most cost-effective treatment option given the cost of replenishing treatment supplies and ongoing home care for IPC therapy versus hospital-based pleurodesis. </li>
    <li>Based on the results of one cost-effectiveness study, treatment with talc pleurodesis was less costly than IPC with similar effectiveness. IPC became more cost effective when life expectancy was 6 weeks or less. Using data from a recent randomized control trial (RCT) comparing IPC with talc pleurodesis found no significant difference in mean cost of managing patients with IPC versus talc pleurodesis. However, for patients with limited survival (less than 14 weeks) IPC was significantly less expensive than talc pleurodesis. </li>

<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it is sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The recommended total amount of fluid removed per session of thoracentesis is 1000 mL to 1500 mL although clinician judgment may be used to remove more if chest symptoms and/or pleural pressure are monitored. In some cases significantly less fluid should be removed if the patient develops chest discomfort or tightness during drainage or if pleural pressures decrease below -20cmH20. Thoracentesis is associated with a small risk of re-expansion pulmonary edema, which occurs in approximately 1 percent of patients, but it is independent of the volume of fluid removed, pleural pressures, and pleural elastance. </li>
    <li>Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) requires a regular outpatient drainage schedule, which may be burdensome for the patient or caregiver, therefore, patient preferences must be considered when balancing the requirements for hospitalization in the case of pleurodesis versus IPC in an ambulatory and outpatient setting. Complications from IPCs are uncommon. One multicentre study of 1,021 malignant pleural effusion (MPE) patients reported an infection rate of 5 percent from IPCs, of which 54 percent could be treated with antibiotics without removal of the catheter. A systematic review of IPC safety found that both serious and minor complications were rare and that their use was without complications in 87.5 percent of patients. Specifically, the following complications were reported: empyema (2.8 percent), pneumothorax requiring a chest tube (5.9 percent), unspecified pneumothorax (3.9 percent), cellulitis (3.4 percent), obstruction/clogging (3.7 percent), and unspecified catheter malfunction (9.1 percent). </li>
    <li>The most common adverse events associated with talc pleurodesis are fever, pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms; less common complications include arrhythmia, dyspnea, respiratory failure, systemic inflammatory responses, empyema, and talc dissemination. </li>
    <li>Consider patient and caregiver/family acceptability of an intervention, cost, and avoidance of invasive procedures and complications that remove the patient from their home and disrupt the course of their terminal cancer. </li>
