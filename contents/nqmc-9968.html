<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the number of acute inpatient stays for patients 18 years of age and older during the measurement year that were followed by an acute readmission for any diagnosis within 30 days and the predicted probability of an acute readmission. Data are reported in the following categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Count of Index Hospital Stays (IHS) (denominator) </li>
    <li>Count of 30-Day Readmissions (numerator) </li>
    <li>Average Adjusted Probability of Readmission </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This measure is limited to patients 18 to 64 covered by commercial insurance and patient 65 and older covered by Medicare. The reason for the restricted population is that the measure relies on a risk-adjusted methodology based on payer age age-specific weights. Aligning the eligible population with the respective payer (i.e., commercial and Medicare) and age group will ensure a more accurate comparison between the observed readmission rates and the average adjusted probability rates. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Discharge from a hospital is a critical transition point in a patient's care. Poor care coordination at discharge can lead to adverse events for patients and avoidable rehospitalization. Hospitalization readmissions may indicate poor care or missed opportunities to coordinate care better. Research shows that specific hospital-based initiatives to improve communication with beneficiaries and their caregivers, coordinate care after discharge and improve the quality of care during the initial admission can avert many readmissions. </p>
<p>There is extensive evidence about adverse events in patients, and this measure aims to distinguish readmissions from complications of care and pre-existing comorbidities (Gallagher, Cen, &amp; Hannan, 2005). </p>
<p>Potentially preventable readmissions are defined as readmissions that are directly tied to conditions that could have been avoided in the inpatient setting. While not all preventable readmissions can be avoided, most potentially preventable readmissions can be prevented if the best quality of care is rendered and clinicians are using current standards of care.</p></div>

Once NCQA establishes national benchmarks for accountable care organization (ACO) performance, all measures will undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomial statistical analysis. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test.</p></div>
