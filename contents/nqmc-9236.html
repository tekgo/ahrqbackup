Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the number of school days that children missed in the past 12 months due to illness or injury, based on parents' response to the following item on the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>K7Q02: During the past 12 months, about how many days did [child] miss school because of illness or injury?
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Response choices for the above question are "__ days," "None," "Entire school year," "Home schooled," "Did not go to school," "Don't know," and "Refused." </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Each missed school day contributes to a potential in disparities in learning. This outcome can help researchers and policy makers understand the complexity of children with special health care needs, as well as formulate interventions that would decrease the impact of a chronic condition on the child. </p>
<p>The measure of missed school days shows the impact of a child's health on the child's social functioning and educational opportunities. Children with chronic conditions (CSHCN) report higher numbers of missed school days than non-CSHCN. In order to eliminate educational disparities among children living with illness, policy makers must understand the extent of missed school days across populations. </p>
<p>There is a broad range in the proportion of children who are missing more than two weeks of school across states. The range across states is 3.6% of children in Georgia to 10.6% of children living in West Virginia. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted testing of the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) to make sure the entire survey instrument was functioning properly. A total of 95,677 surveys were completed nationally for children between the ages of 0 and 17 years. The questionnaire was then revised and finalized based on feedback from participants in these interviews. </p>
<p>The Maternal and Child Health Bureau leads the development of the NSCH and National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) survey and indicators, in collaboration with the NCHS and a national technical expert panel. The expert panel includes representatives from other federal agencies, state Title V leaders, family organizations, and child health researchers, and experts in all fields related to the surveys (adolescent health, family and neighborhoods, early childhood and development, etc.). Previously validated questions and scales are used when available. Extensive literature reviewing and expert reviewing of items is conducted for all aspects of the survey. Respondents' cognitive understanding of the survey questions is assessed during the pretest phase and revisions made as required. All final data components are verified by NCHS and Data Resource Center/Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (DRC/CAHMI) staff prior to public release. Face validity is conducted in comparing results with prior years of the survey and/or results from other implementations of items. No specific reliability results are available for this measure. </p></div>
