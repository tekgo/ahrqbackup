<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim address by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients who receive appropriate falls risk assessment and falls prevention interventions.</p>
<p>Falls are a leading cause of hospital-acquired injury, and frequently prolong or complicate hospital stays. Falls are the most common adverse event reported in hospitals. Reviews of observational studies in acute care hospitals show that fall rates range from 1.3 to 8.9 falls/1,000 patient days and that higher rates occur in units that focus on eldercare, neurology and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>In spite of extensive research on falls risk factors and the development of a number of falls risk instruments, protocols are applied inconsistently, and risk factor directed interventions are far from standardized. The best guide to effective fall prevention strategies is effective adoption of the key common elements in better performing falls programs and hospitals. These strategies are then adapted and modified according to the characteristics and abilities of that hospital.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Application of interventions similar to those suggested in this protocol have achieved further reduction in fall and injury rates. A four-year fall rate reduction of 63.9% to 1.3 falls/1,000 patient days with only two major injuries over four years has been reported by Staten Island University Hospital. </li>
    <li>A leading goal of the patient safety movement is the reduction and eventual elimination of falls that result in injury. Therefore, falls prevention programs should focus on factors associated with increased injury risk. The epidemiology of falls with injury may vary by hospital type, such as academic or non-academic, or physical plant factors. A retrospective cohort study of nine midwestern hospitals stated that injury was associated with older age, unassisted falls, bathroom falls and in patient care areas outside of the patient's room. </li>
    <li>Many reportable falls were related to problems with the fall risk assessment process, including inconsistent application of interventions to the patient's fall risk, miscommunication of fall risk, or failure to properly assign patients to high risk. One third of reportable falls with injury were related to bathroom use, over half were associated with "culprit medications" such as antianxiety or antipsychotic medication, and 40% occurred within 30 minutes of an intentional (hourly) rounding visit. </li>
</ul>
