Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of recommendation (I-III) and classification of evidence (I-III) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level I</span></strong></p>
<p>All motorcyclists should wear motorcycle helmets when riding motorcycles to reduce the incidence of head injury and severe head injury after a crash.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: This statement was made a level recommendation despite a lack of class I data because of the volume of consistent class II data, including robust prospective data, to support this finding without any methodologically similar data to refute it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level II</span></strong></p>
<p>All motorcyclists should wear motorcycle helmets when riding motorcycles to improve overall survival and reduce head injury-related mortality after a crash.</p>
<p>Mandatory universal motorcycle helmet laws should be introduced or reenacted to reduce mortality and head injury after a crash.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Classes of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective, randomized clinical trials</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Clinical studies in which data were collected prospectively or retrospective analyses based on clearly reliable data</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Studies based on retrospectively collected data</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: The recommendation is convincingly justifiable based on the available scientific information alone. This recommendation is usually based on Class I data, however, strong Class II evidence may form the basis for a Level I recommendation, especially if the issue does not lend itself to testing in a randomized format. Conversely, low quality or contradictory Class I data may not be able to support a Level I recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Level II</strong>: The recommendation is reasonably justifiable by available scientific evidence and strongly supported by expert opinion. This recommendation is usually supported by Class II data or a preponderance of Class III evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: The recommendation is supported by available data but adequate scientific evidence is lacking. This recommendation is generally supported by Class III data. This type of recommendation is useful for educational purposes and in guiding future clinical research.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>A computerized search of the world's literature was undertaken using PubMed, of the US National Library of Medicine, extending back to 1990 to the present (2009) using the key words: helmet + (motorcycle OR crash). There were 507 citations identified. The abstract for each was reviewed, and 197 candidate articles having possible applicability to the guideline topic were retrieved and reviewed. General reviews, letters to the editor, single case reports, and retrospective reviews of poor quality were excluded. This left 45 articles that were felt to have sufficient merit to form the basis for the guidelines (See Table 1 in original guideline document). The articles were reviewed in detail by the authors.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>PubMed, PubMed Central, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched from October 12, 2010 to October 12, 2015 using the search terms helmet motorcycle injury prevention, helmet injury prevention, helmet head injury prevention, and motorcycle helmet. All articles with injury and/or mortality as an outcome were included. Non-English language, non-injury outcomes, technical articles, editorials, and opinion papers were excluded.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>As there were no class I studies to review, the studies reviewed did not vary across the classes of evidence in a useful manner. Therefore, the authors categorized the articles in this review by study design. There were prospective cohort and cross-sectional studies. However, the majority of the studies were retrospective, either before and after cross-sectional studies of helmet law changes or cross-sectional studies of helmeted in comparison with nonhelmeted riders. Finally, the authors also identified case-control studies.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations were made on the basis of the studies included in the evidentiary table (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Recommendations were classified as level 1, 2, or 3 according to the definitions listed in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive literature search was performed. Articles were first screened by title and abstract, and then salient articles were reviewed by a single reviewer. The final article list (N=8) was reviewed, and no articles were found to contradict the recommendations in the 2010 guideline. Recent research has focused on the costs attributable to unhelmeted motorcyclist crashes and comparative efficacy of different types of motorcycle helmets.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The main limitation of these uncontrolled and observational studies involves the collection and incorporation in the analysis of potential confounders for the outcomes studied. The wearing of helmets is associated with multiple factors, many of which have also been shown to be associated with the incidence and severity of crashes. Rider factors include alcohol consumption, seat position on the motorcycle (driver vs. passenger), age, and gender. There are also environmental factors such as weather, time of day; other policy factors such as speed limits and DUI laws; and other intrinsic motorcycle factors such as the size and type of motorcycle itself (the potential kinetic energy of the crash) also contribute to motorcycle crash occurrence and severity and ultimately crash consequences for the rider. Unfortunately, many of these factors are not easy to reliably measure on a crash-to-crash basis, and therefore, only nine studies, in part, adjusted for at least a portion of these factors. There were other studies that stratified the study group by various factors but did not control for them in their analysis. The majority of the studies did not control for any potential confounders. A second methodological concern is selection bias. The subjects in these studies were not selected randomly, except for the one cohort study that chose the students randomly. There were missing data, and no studies had information on those &ldquo;not chosen&rdquo; to confirm that they were the same as those included in the study. </li>
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
