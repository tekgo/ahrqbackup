Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: The original guideline document provides guidance for surgical attire including scrub attire, shoes, jewelry, head coverings, and masks worn in the semi-restricted and restricted areas of the perioperative practice setting. The original guideline document also provides guidance for personal items such as stethoscopes, backpacks, briefcases, cell phones, and tablets.</p>
<p>The original guideline document does not address patient clothing or linens used in health care facilities. A complete discussion of the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and sterile attire worn at the surgical field is outside the scope of the original guideline document. Refer to the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) summaries of the AORN guidelines: <a href="/content.aspx?id=43784" title="Guideline #9619">Recommended practices for sterile technique</a>, <a href="/content.aspx?id=43785" title="Guideline #9620">Recommended practices for prevention of transmissible infections in the perioperative practice setting</a>, and <a href="/content.aspx?id=47826" title="Guideline #10244">Recommended practices for sharps safety</a> for additional information. The use of nail polish, artificial nails, or other nail enhancements and the recommended fingernail length for perioperative personnel is outside the scope of the original guideline document. Refer to the AORN Guideline for Hand Hygiene for additional information. Ensuring and monitoring personnel compliance with policies and procedures for surgical attire and personal hygiene is a responsibility of the facility or health care organization administrators.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>Clean surgical attire should be worn in the semi-restricted and restricted areas of the perioperative setting. </li>
    <li>All individuals who enter the semi-restricted and restricted areas should wear scrub attire that has been laundered at a health care-accredited laundry facility or disposable scrub attire provided by the facility and intended for use within the perioperative setting. </li>
    <li>Personnel entering the semi-restricted and restricted areas should cover the head, hair, ears, and facial hair. </li>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Evidence Review</strong></p>
<p>On June 25 and June 27, 2013, a medical librarian conducted a systematic search of the databases MEDLINE&reg; and CINAHL&reg; and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled and non-randomized trials and studies, case reports, letters, reviews, and guidelines. The librarian also searched the Scopus database, although not systematically. The search was limited to literature published in English from January 2008 through June 2013.</p>
<p>Search terms included <em>surgical attire, clothing, personal protective equipment, protective gloves, respiratory protective devices, masks, eye protection, goggles, scrubs, surgical gown, jumpsuit, head covering, surgical cap, hoods, coveralls, bunny suit, textiles, bedding and linens, privacy curtain, hospital laundry service, laundering, laundry, washing machine, tie, backpack, fanny pack, fleece, briefcase, purse, stethoscope, lanyard, badge, patient attire, patient clothing, colonization, fomites, tattooing, body piercing, jewelry, ring, wedding band, fingernails, eyelashes, facial hair, beard, groin, armpit, scalp, skin, squames, dandruff, epithelial cells, seborrheic dermatitis, computers, mobile communication device, mobile phone, cell phone, cellular phone, tablet computer, smartphone, iPad, iPhone, text messaging, pollen, dust, fungi, mold, equipment contamination, nosocomial, cross infection, infectious disease transmission, surgical wound infection, bacterial load, and infection control</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of the search, the librarian established weekly alerts on the search topics and until March 2014, presented relevant results to the lead author.</p>
<p>Prior to the search, the medical librarian provided to the lead author the results of literature searches conducted for the 2010 edition of the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Recommended Practices for Surgical Attire. These articles had no time restriction. During the development of this edition, the authors also requested supplementary literature searches and additional literature that either did not fit the original search criteria or was discovered during the evidence-appraisal process. The time restriction was not considered in these subsequent searches. Relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies also were identified.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, relevance to the key questions, and publication dates within the time restriction unless none were available. Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications; literature that examined the use of sterile gowns, drapes, and masks worn for maintaining sterile technique; low-quality evidence when higher quality evidence was available; and literature outside the time restriction when literature within the time restriction was available.</p>
<p>See Figure 1 in the original guideline document for a flow diagram of literature search results.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Articles identified by the search were provided to the project team. The team consisted of the lead author, a co-author, five members of the Guidelines Advisory Board, and two evidence appraisers. The lead author and the evidence appraisers reviewed and critically appraised each article using the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Research or Non-Research Evidence Appraisal Tools as appropriate. The literature was independently evaluated and appraised according to the strength and quality of the evidence. Each article was then assigned an appraisal score.</p>
<p>Notably, much of the evidence related to surgical attire is not recent evidence. There are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or systematic reviews that show a direct causal relationship between surgical attire and surgical site infection (SSI). There are many confounding variables that affect a patient's risk for SSI, and this makes it extraordinarily difficult to identify surgical attire as a singular source of SSIs. It is a well-accepted scientific principle that increased numbers of microorganisms in the perioperative environment will increase the patient's risk for SSI. It is unnecessary, and it may be unethical, for researchers to perform new studies for the sole purpose of demonstrating this recognized concept.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The methodology of the research and non-research evidence used to support this document was critically evaluated by the authors for validity and generalizability to current practice. The collective evidence supporting each intervention within a specific recommendation was summarized by the authors, and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Evidence Rating Model was used to rate the strength of the evidence. Factors considered in the review of the collective evidence were the quality of evidence, the quantity of similar evidence on a given topic, and the consistency of evidence supporting a recommendation.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evidence from a meta-analysis or systematic review of research studies that incorporated evidence appraisal and synthesis of the evidence in the analysis </li>
    <li>Supportive evidence from a single well-conducted randomized controlled trial </li>
    <li>Guidelines that are developed by a panel of experts, that derive from an explicit literature search methodology, and include evidence appraisal and synthesis of the evidence. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1: Regulatory Requirement</strong>: Federal law or regulation</p>
<p><strong>2: Moderate Evidence</strong>: Interventions or activities for which the evidence is less well established than for those listed under "1: Strong Evidence"</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Supportive evidence from a well-conducted research study </li>
    <li>Guidelines developed by a panel of experts which are primarily based on the evidence but not supported by evidence appraisal and synthesis of the evidence </li>
    <li>Non-research evidence with consistent results and fairly definitive conclusions </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3: Limited Evidence</strong>: Interventions or activities for which there are currently insufficient evidence or evidence of inadequate quality.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Supportive evidence from a poorly conducted research study </li>
    <li>Evidence from non-experimental studies with high potential for bias </li>

</ul>
<p><strong>4: Benefits Balanced with Harms</strong>: Selected interventions or activities for which the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Recommended Practices Advisory Board (RPAB) is of the opinion that the desirable effects of following this recommendation outweigh the harms.</p>
