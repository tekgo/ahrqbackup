Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) who have a depression severity classification and who receive, at a minimum, treatment appropriate to their depression severity classification at the most recent visit during the measurement period.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Given the variation in the presentation of depression, ensuring the appropriate treatment method is of great importance. For those with active depression, the appropriate treatment method can induce remission and help patients achieve a return to a baseline level of functioning. For those for whom depression is in remission, the appropriate choice of treatment method can help prevent future relapse.</p>
<p>Gonz&aacute;lez and colleagues (2010) found that guideline adherence for depression treatment is well below standards; the prevalence of past-year depression care use among patients meeting major depressive disorder (MDD) criteria showed that only 34% of patients received pharmacotherapy, 44% received psychotherapy, 51% received any depression therapy, and only 28% of patients received combined depression therapy. Other studies have shown that 84% of depressed patients receive therapy that is appropriate for their depression presentation, while only 80% of depressed patients with comorbid anxiety or panic receive the appropriate treatment (Hepner et al., 2007). Of more concern, only 38% of patients unresponsive to treatment receive treatment adjustment, and, amongst the elderly, only 26% of depressed patients receive any appropriate treatment (Hepner et al., 2007).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines. Only selected portions of the clinical guidelines are quoted here; for more details, please refer to the full guideline</strong>.</p>
<p>Treatment in the acute phase should be aimed at inducing remission of the major depressive episode and achieving a full return to the patient's baseline level of functioning (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2010). </p>
<p>Acute phase treatment may include pharmacotherapy, depression-focused psychotherapy, the combination of medications and psychotherapy, or other somatic therapies such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or light therapy, as described in the sections that follow. Selection of an initial treatment modality should be influenced by clinical features (e.g., severity of symptoms, presence of co-occurring disorders or psychosocial stressors) as well as other factors (e.g., patient preference, prior treatment experiences) (APA, 2010).</p>
<p>Antidepressant medication could also include a mood stabilizer. </p>
<p>Any treatment should be integrated with psychiatric management and any other treatments being provided for other diagnoses (APA, 2010).</p>
<p>Patients who are diagnosed with mild-moderate MDD should receive an initial trial of monotherapy that incorporates either an antidepressant medication or psychotherapy. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
    <li>Patient preferences, resources, and tolerability of treatment should be considered in determining the choice between an antidepressant and psychotherapy. </li>
    <li>Monotherapy should be optimized before proceeding to subsequent strategies by monitoring outcomes, maximizing dosage (medication or psychotherapy), and allowing sufficient response time (8 to 12 weeks) (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009). </li>
</ol></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Prevalence and Incidence</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depressive disorder affects approximately 14.8 million American adults, or about 6.7 percent of the U.S. population aged 18 and older in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2010). </li>
    <li>While major depressive disorder can develop at any age, the median age at onset is 32 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>Major depressive disorder is more prevalent in women than in men (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>Depressive disorders are more common among persons with chronic conditions (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and cancer) and among those with unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity, and binge drinking) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disability</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for ages 15 to 44 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suicide</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Research has shown that more than 90% of people who kill themselves have depression or another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder (Conwell &amp; Brent, 1995). </li>
    <li>Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the 30,000 reported suicides in the U.S. each year (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). </li>
    <li>The suicide rate for older adults is more than 50% higher than the rate for the nation as a whole. Up to two-thirds of older adult suicides are attributed to untreated or misdiagnosed depression (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disparities</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic persons of other races are more likely to report major depression than non-Hispanic whites, based on responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8), which covers eight of the nine criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) for diagnosis of major depressive disorder (CDC, 2010). </li>
    <li>For individuals who experienced a depressive disorder in the past year, 63.7% of Latinos, 68.7% of Asians, and 58.8% of African Americans, compared with 40.2% of non-Latino whites, did not access any mental health treatment in the past year (Alegr&iacute;a et al., 2008). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Populations: Geriatrics</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The rate of depression in adults older than 65 years of age ranges from 7% to 36% in medical outpatient clinics and increases to 40% in the hospitalized elderly (Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [ICSI], 2010). </li>
    <li>Comorbidities are more common in the elderly. The highest rates of depression are found in those with strokes (30% to 60%), coronary artery disease (up to 44%), cancer (up to 40%), Parkinson's disease (40%), and Alzheimer's disease (20% to 40%) (ICSI, 2010). </li>
    <li>Similar to other groups, the elderly with depression are more likely than younger patients to underreport depressive symptoms (ICSI, 2010). </li>
