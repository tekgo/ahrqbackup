<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, <strong>Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based</strong>, <strong>Formal consensus</strong>, <strong>Informal consensus</strong>, <strong>No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>After a histopathologic confirmation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis, what initial assessment is recommended before initiating therapy for locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.1</em>: A multiphase computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed to assess extent of disease. Other staging studies should be performed only as dictated by symptoms (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.2</em>: The baseline performance status (PS), symptom burden, and comorbidity profile of a patient diagnosed with LAPC should be carefully evaluated (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.3</em>: The goals of care (including a discussion of an advance directive), patient preferences, as well as support systems should be discussed with every person diagnosed with LAPC and his or her caregivers (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.4</em>: Multidisciplinary collaboration to formulate treatment and care plans and disease management for patients with LAPC should be the standard of care (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 1.5</em>: Every person with pancreatic cancer should be offered information about clinical trials&mdash;therapeutic trials in all lines of treatment, as well as palliative care, biorepository/biomarker, and observational studies (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the appropriate initial treatment approach for people diagnosed with LAPC?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 2.1</em>: Initial systemic therapy with combination regimens is recommended for most patients who meet the following criteria: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS 0 or 1, a favorable comorbidity profile, and patient preference and a support system for aggressive medical therapy. There is no clear evidence to support one regimen over another, and physicians may offer therapy on the basis of extrapolation from data derived from studies in the metastatic setting. For some patients, conformal radiation therapy (CRT) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) may be offered up front, on the basis of patient and physician preference (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 3</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Which patients with LAPC may be offered radiation therapy (CRT/SBRT)?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.1</em>: If there is local disease progression after induction chemotherapy, but without evidence of systemic spread, then CRT may be offered to patients who meet the following criteria: first-line chemotherapy treatment is completed or terminated; ECOG PS &le;2; a comorbidity profile that is adequate, including adequate hepatic and renal function and hematologic status; and patient preference (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.2</em>: CRT may be offered to patients who have responded to an initial 6 months of chemotherapy or have stable disease, or have developed unacceptable chemotherapy-related toxicities or show a decline in PS as a consequence of chemotherapy toxicity (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 3.3</em>: If there is response or stable disease after 6 months of induction chemotherapy, CRT may be offered as an alternative to continuing chemotherapy alone for any patient with LAPC (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Which people with LAPC may be initially offered SBRT?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 4.1</em>: Clinicians may offer SBRT for treatment of patients with LAPC, although the evidence quality is intermediate so additional prospective and/or randomized trials are required to definitively compare results of SBRT with chemotherapy alone and SBRT (Type: informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 5</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Which people with LAPC whose disease has progressed (abdominal pain, worsening jaundice, increase in size of tumor and/or new metastatic lesions on imaging study; persistently increasing serum cancer antigen [CA] 19-9) should be offered additional treatment per the ASCO metastatic pancreatic cancer guideline?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.1</em>: All people who have not benefited from first-line treatment and have disease progression should be offered treatment per the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Treatment Guideline. See the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) summary of the ASCO guideline <a href="/summaries/summary/50448/" title="Guideline #11045" target="_blank">Metastatic pancreatic cancer</a> and the summary table of recommendations for metastatic pancreatic cancer in the Data Supplement (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 5.2</em>: Refer people with LAPC who have not benefited from treatment and have disease progression for a clinical trial (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 6</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>When should the concept of palliative care be introduced? When should a palliative care consult be initiated?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 6.1</em>: People with LAPC should have a full assessment of symptom burden, psychological status, and social supports, as early as possible&mdash;preferably at the first visit. In most cases, this will indicate a need for a formal palliative care consult and services (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 7</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>For people with LAPC, what are the recommended strategies for relief of pain and symptom burden?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7.1</em>: People with LAPC should be offered aggressive treatment of the pain and other symptoms of the cancer and/or cancer-directed therapy (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 7.2</em>: A short course of palliative radiotherapy (conventional RT or SBRT) may be offered to patients with LAPC who meet the following criteria: prominent local symptoms, such as abdominal pain and/or worsening jaundice and/or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; local infiltration into the GI tract causing impending gastric outlet or duodenal obstruction; and patient preference (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 8</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the recommended frequency of follow-up care/surveillance for people with LAPC?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8.1</em>: In the absence of RCT evidence, the Panel consensus is that patients with LAPC who have completed treatment and have stable disease or no disease progression schedule follow-up visits every 2 to 3 months that include a physical examination and liver and renal function laboratory testing for a 2-year duration. The intervals can then be increased to every 6 months (Type: Informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>
<p><em>Recommendation 8.2</em>: Data are not definitive, but the Panel recommends testing markers (CA 19-9) and imaging (CT) should be performed at least every 3 months during the first 2 years. Imaging intervals can be increased to every 6 months once stability is comfortably established. The routine use of positron emission tomography/CT imaging for the management of LAPC is not recommended. Tumor markers such as CA 19-9 should not replace imaging as an assessment (Type: Informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations were developed by the multidisciplinary Expert Panel using a systematic review of articles (April 2002 to June 2015) of phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Other peer-reviewed articles were used to inform the recommendations on palliative care and patient and clinical communication as well as the section on health disparities. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence on the basis of the following criteria: patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC), phase III RCTs of chemotherapy alone and/or with chemoradiotherapy and/or compared with a control arm, in English, and with human subjects.</p>
<p>Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, or narrative reviews; or published in a non-English language.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>Computerized literature searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were performed. The searches of the English-language literature published from January 2000 to June 2015 combined pancreatic neoplasm terms and follow-up-related terms and MeSH headings. Results of the databases searches were supplemented with hand searching of the bibliographies of systematic reviews and selected seminal articles, and contributions from Expert Panel members' personal files.</p>
<p>Details of the literature search strategy are provided in Data Supplement 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). A Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) Diagram illustrating the article selection process is available in Data Supplement 4 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by two American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewers in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by two staff reviewers and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in Data Supplements 1 and 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Quality Assessment</span></strong></p>
<p>Study design aspects related to individual study quality, strength of evidence, strength of recommendations, and risk of bias were assessed and are shown in Data Supplement 1, Table 2. The study quality was high for this group of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed with factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, and so on generally indicating a low potential risk of bias for most of the identified evidence. Follow-up times varied between studies, decreasing the comparability of the results. Refer to the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields for definitions of ratings of evidence quality, strength of recommendations, and overall potential risk of bias.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Panel Composition</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, pathology, community oncology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel met via webinar on several occasions and corresponded frequently through e-mail; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs along with ASCO staff. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software&trade;. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.</p>
<p>Some recommendations are based on informal consensus by the Panel, because there was no RCT evidence.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost Implications</span></strong></p>
<p>There are limited cost-effectiveness analyses regarding the various treatment modalities used in the multidisciplinary management of locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC). However, the available data seem to support the recommendations outlined in the guideline.</p>
<p>One study (LAPC and metastatic pancreatic cancer) found in elderly patients that radiation plus fluorouracil had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $68,724/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) relative to no treatment and suggested that radiation plus gemcitabine would be cost effective as well. Another study (LAPC and metastatic pancreatic cancer) focused on the high cost of radiotherapy with the limited survival of pancreatic cancer. Compared with gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $69,500/QALY, whereas gemcitabine plus conventional radiotherapy versus gemcitabine alone had an ICER of $126,800/QALY, and gemcitabine plus intensity modulated radiation therapy versus gemcitabine plus conventional radiotherapy had an ICER of $1,584,100/QALY. The authors concluded that these results indicated gemcitabine plus intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) exceeded society's cost-effectiveness standards, and gemcitabine plus SBRT provided a clinical benefit potentially acceptable by cost-effectiveness standards. Further studies are needed to understand the cost effectiveness of all treatment options for those patients diagnosed with LAPC.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Implementation</span></strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the <a href="http://www.asco.org/" title="ASCO Web site">ASCO Web site</a> and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> (<em>JCO</em>) and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
