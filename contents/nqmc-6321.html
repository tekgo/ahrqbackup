<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Millions of patients in the United States use warfarin to prevent strokes or to prevent or treat venous thromboembolism. Warfarin is highly effective, and has been in clinical use for over 50 years. However, warfarin is difficult to manage because it has many possible interactions with diet, other drugs, and comorbid conditions that may destabilize anticoagulation control. The possible consequences of insufficient or excessive anticoagulation are extremely serious and often fatal, making it imperative to pursue good control.</p>
<p>The international normalized ratio (INR) test is the laboratory test used to determine the degree to which the patient's coagulation has been successfully suppressed by the vitamin K antagonist (VKA). For most patients, the goal is to keep the INR between 2 and 3, which roughly corresponds to the blood taking 2 to 3 times as long to clot as would a normal person's blood. This level of anticoagulation has been shown to maximize benefit (i.e., protect patients from blood clots) while minimizing risk (i.e., risk of hemorrhage attributable to excessive anticoagulation). Therapeutic INR range (TTR) is a way of summarizing INR control over time.</p>
<p>TTR has been followed before, mostly in the setting of clinical trials where it is used to evaluate the effectiveness of warfarin therapy, particularly when warfarin is being compared to some other strategy. However, TTR has not previously been used as a quality measure &ndash; in fact, there has been a general lack of quality measurement in oral anticoagulation. There is much evidence that better anticoagulation control (i.e., higher TTR) can protect patients from severe or even fatal adverse events.</p></div>

Incidence/Prevalence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The number of dispensed outpatient prescriptions for warfarin in the United States (U.S.) increased from 21 million in 1998 to nearly 31 million in 2004. While there are no firm estimates for the number of patients receiving warfarin, even assuming 12 prescriptions per year for all patients, this would suggest approximately 2.5 million users in 2004, or approximately 1% of the U.S. population. In fact, patients may not receive 12 prescriptions per year (because of 90-day prescriptions and the like), so this number may be closer to 2% of the U.S. population. Also, these estimates do not account for the fact that the number of prescriptions for warfarin probably has continued to increase since 2004.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>A study of 124,551 patients who received outpatient oral anticoagulation from 100 Veterans Administration (VA) sites of care for indications other than valvular heart disease demonstrated that risk-adjusted therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) range (TTR) can be used as a quality indicator for oral anticoagulation care. Risk-adjusted TTR is feasible to measure and is relatively consistent from year to year, suggesting that it is measuring an aspect of quality of care that is stable over time.
