<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (or caregiver[s], as appropriate) who had the Parkinson's disease treatment options (e.g., non-pharmacological treatment, pharmacological treatment, or surgical treatment) reviewed at least once annually.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There are many different pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and surgical treatment options available for patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD). Within each type of treatment, there are also multiple factors to be considered when deciding whether a patient with PD is a candidate for the treatment option.</p>
<p>With the advent of newly available pharmacological treatments from many different ongoing clinical trials and studies, the patient's current medication treatment should be reviewed as therapy-based reviews are updated.*</p>
<p class="Note">*The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:</p>
<p class="Note">People with PD should have regular access to the following: clinical monitoring and medication adjustment; a continuing point of contact for support, including home visits when appropriate; a reliable source of information about clinical and social matters of concern to people with PD and their carers which may be provided by a PD nurse specialist. (NICE GL35, Jun 2006)</p>
<p class="Note">With the current evidence it is not possible to decide if the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus interna is the preferred target for deep brain stimulation for people with PD, or whether one form of surgery is more effective or safer than the other. In considering the type of surgery, account should be taken of: clinical and lifestyle characteristics of the person with PD; patient preference, after the patient has been informed of the potential benefits; and drawbacks of the different surgical procedures. (Level D) (NICE GL35, Jun 2006)</p></div>
