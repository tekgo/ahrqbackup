<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, who undergo surgical or therapeutic procedures under general or neuraxial anesthesia of 60 minutes duration or longer for whom at least one body temperature greater than or equal to 35.5 degrees Celsius (or 95.9 degrees Fahrenheit) was recorded within the 30 minutes immediately before or the 15 minutes immediately after anesthesia end time.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A drop in core temperature during surgery, known as perioperative hypothermia, can result in numerous adverse effects, which can include adverse myocardial outcomes, subcutaneous vasoconstriction, increased incidence of surgical site infection, and impaired healing of wounds (Hannan et al., 2010). The desired outcome, reduction in adverse surgical effects due to perioperative hypothermia, is affected by maintenance of normothermia during surgery. </p>
<p>Unintended perioperative hypothermia occurs in up to 20% of surgical patients (Hart et al., 2011). An observational cohort study in a pediatric setting found that more than 50% of children experienced intraoperative hypothermia. Pediatric patients undergoing major surgery were at greater risk of intraoperative hypothermia (Pearce et al., 2010).</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>:</p>
<p><em>Preadmission/Preoperative Recommendations</em></p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Assess for risk factors for perioperative hypothermia; measure patient temperature on admission; determine patient's thermal comfort level; assess for signs and symptoms of hypothermia; document and communicate all risk factor assessment findings to all members of the anesthesia/surgical team.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions</strong>: Implement passive thermal care measures; maintain ambient room temperature at or above 24 degrees Celsius; institute active warming for patients who are hypothermic; consider preoperative warming to reduce the risk of intra/postoperative hypothermia.</p>
<p><em>Intraoperative Recommendations</em></p>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Identify patient's risk factors for unplanned preoperative hypothermia; frequent intraoperative temperature monitoring should be considered in all cases; assess for signs and symptoms of hypothermia; determine patient's thermal comfort level; document and communicate all risk factor assessment findings to all members of the anesthesia/surgical team.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions</strong>: Limit skin exposure to lower ambient environmental temperatures; initiate passive warming measures; maintain ambient room temperature from 20-25 degrees Celsius based on Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) and architectural recommendations; patients undergoing a procedure with an anticipated anesthesia time greater than 30 minutes and/or who are hypothermic preoperatively, and/or patients at risk for hypothermia or at increased risk for suffering its complications &ndash; forced air warming should be implemented; there is evidence to suggest that alternative active warming measures may maintain normothermia when used alone or in combination with forced air warming. These warming measures include: warmed IV fluids, warmed irrigation fluids, circulating water garments, circulating water mattresses, radiant heat, gel pad surface warming, resistive heating (Hooper et al., 2010). </p>
<p>Maintenance of body temperature in a normothermic range is recommended for most procedures other than during periods in which mild hypothermia is intended to provide organ protection (e.g., during high aortic cross-clamping) (Fleisher et al., 2007).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Dataset</strong><br />
The Anesthesia Quality Institute National Anesthesia Clinical Outcome Registry (NACOR) Public Use File was used to assess available data on the submitted outcome <em>Perioperative Temperature Management</em> measure and the measure's performance, as extracted according to the measure specifications, for 2010 to 2013.</p>
<p>For comparison on reliability, performance rates and other indicators of quality, The Anesthesia Quality Institute NACOR Public Use File was used to assess data on the process <em>Perioperative Temperature Management</em> measure (National Quality Forum [NQF] #0454/Physician Quality Reporting System [PQRS] #193).</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong><br />
Reliability was calculated according to the methods outlined in a technical report prepared by J.L. Adams titled <em>The Reliability of Provider Profiling: A Tutorial</em>. In this context, reliability represents the ability of a measure to confidently distinguish the performance of one physician from another. As discussed in the report: "Conceptually, it is the ratio of signal to noise. The signal in this case is the proportion of variability in measured performance that can be explained by real differences in performance. There are 3 main drivers of reliability; sample size, differences between physicians, and measurement error." According to this approach, reliability is estimated with a beta-binomial model. The beta-binomial model is appropriate for measuring the reliability of pass/fail measures such as those proposed.</p>
<p>Reliability for the outcome <em>Perioperative Temperature Management</em> measure, as extracted from cases where a temperature was recorded and submitted to NACOR, reflects the limited number of cases and providers available to analyze. As cases and providers increase, the reliability of the measure is expected to increase as well. We expect, should this measure be endorsed by NQF and added to quality reporting programs, that the increase of provider data submission will impact the performance scores and improve measure reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Validity</strong><br />
Face validity of the measure score as an indicator of quality was systematically assessed as follows. After the measure was fully specified, a group of experts was assembled to rate face validity. The experts included 23 physicians.</p>
<p>The developer provided the detailed measure specifications to the experts and asked them to rate their agreement with the following statement: The scores obtained from the measure as specified will provide an accurate reflection of quality and can be used to distinguish good from poor quality.</p>
<p>The rating scale had five levels (1 to 5) with the following narrative anchors: 1 = Disagree; 3 = Moderate Agreement; 5 = Agree</p>
<p>As additional data and information become available on this measure, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) intends to conduct further measure validity testing on this measure.</p>
<p>The results of the assessment of face validity indicate that an independent group of experts (different from those who advised on measure development) had high levels of agreement with the statement: "The scores obtained from the measure as specified will provide an accurate reflection of quality and can be used to distinguish good and poor quality."</p>
<p>Mean rating = (3.78 out of 5)</p>
<p>This measure was examined through a group of experts. Out of the 23 participants, 16 agreed that the scores from the measure as specified would provide an accurate reflection of quality and 4 disagreed.</p>
<p>Additional testing information, including results tables, may be found in the NQF submission form for this measure.</p></div>
