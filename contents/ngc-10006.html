<p><strong>Genetic Test Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>Clinical genotyping tests are available that interrogate variant <em>cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19</em> alleles and predict an individual's <em>CYP2C19</em> metabolizer phenotype. Each named star (*) allele is defined by the genotype at one or more specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (see Supplementary Table S1 online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) and is associated with a level of enzyme activity (see Supplementary Table S2 online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Table 1 below and Supplementary Table S5 online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarize the assignment of the likely <em>CYP2C19</em> phenotype based on common star allele diplotypes, and these assignments are used to link genotypes with personalized antiplatelet therapy.</p>

<p><strong>Therapeutic Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines are designed to help clinicians understand how available genetic test results can be used to optimize drug therapy rather than to recommend in whom pharmacogenetic testing should be conducted. With the growing ease and availability of genetic testing and other sequencing programs, an increasing number of patients in the near future may already know their <em>CYP2C19</em> genotype status at the time of treatment, and this document provides guidance on clinical management for those in whom genotype is available or for whom the clinician chooses to order a <em>CYP2C19</em> genotyping test. With respect to other professional statements, the 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association acute coronary syndrome (ACS) guidelines noted that genetic testing for <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function alleles may be considered on a case-by-case basis, especially for patients who experience recurrent ACS events despite ongoing therapy with clopidogrel. In addition, the committee recommended that genotyping might be considered if results of testing may alter management, which they suggest until better clinical evidence exists to provide a more scientifically derived recommendation.</p>
<p>Optimal individualized antiplatelet treatment should maximize benefit by reducing risk of recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events while minimizing adverse effects such as bleeding. Prasugrel is an approved antiplatelet agent that was superior to clopidogrel in a large-scale randomized trial of ACS patients with planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with a hazards ratio (HR) for CV death, myocardial infarction, or stroke for prasugrel vs. clopidogrel of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73&ndash;0.90, <em>P</em> &lt;0.001), as well as a 42% reduction in stent thrombosis. However, it may not represent a substitute for clopidogrel in all patients due to an increased risk of non-coronary artery bypass grafting thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major bleeding (HR = 1.32, 95% CI =1.03&ndash;1.68; <em>P</em> = 0.03), including fatal bleeding (prasugrel = 0.4% vs. clopidogrel = 0.1%; <em>P </em>= 0.002); its contraindication in some patients (e.g., history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or intracranial bleeding); and the lower expense of generic clopidogrel following the recent expiration of its patent. Of note, the benefit of prasugrel over clopidogrel was found to be greater in patients with a <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function allele, with no significant difference estimated in composite outcome risk between the two antiplatelet agents among <em>CYP2C19</em> extensive metabolizers (i.e., <em>*1/*1</em> patients).</p>
<p>In addition to prasugrel, ticagrelor is a recently approved antiplatelet agent that also was superior to clopidogrel in a large-scale randomized trial of ACS patients with an HR for CV death, myocardial infarction, or stroke for ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel of 0.84 (95% CI = 0.77&ndash;0.92; <em>P</em> &lt;0.001), including a 26% reduction in stent thrombosis and 18% reduction in all-cause mortality. In the genetic substudy, as compared with clopidogrel, ticagrelor reduced the primary end point by 23% among patients carrying any <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function allele (8.6 vs. 11.2%; HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60&ndash;0.99; <em>P</em> = 0.0380) and 14% among patients without any <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function allele (8.8 vs. 10.0%; HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.74&ndash;1.01), although this reduction did not reach statistical significance (<em>P</em> = 0.0608). However, formal interaction testing that evaluated if the effect of ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel varied by genotype was also not significant. Of note, the benefit of ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel was subsequently shown to appear to be most pronounced among the subset of patients with <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function alleles who were undergoing PCI (carriers: 7.7 vs. 10.6%, HR = 0.71; noncarriers: 7.4 vs. 8.2%, HR = 0.90). In addition, it is not known to what extent twice-daily dosing may affect the efficacy of ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel in a real-world setting.</p>
<p>Despite the improvements in overall efficacy reported for prasugrel and ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel, it is anticipated that clopidogrel will continue to be a widely prescribed medication for ACS/PCI patients. Genotype-directed therapy could identify patients who benefit most from alternative antiplatelet therapy. For clinicians considering treatment with clopidogrel, Table 2 below and Figure 1 in the original guideline document summarize the therapeutic recommendations for antiplatelet therapy based on <em>CYP2C19</em> status. Standard dosing of clopidogrel, as recommended in the product insert, is warranted among ACS/PCI patients with a predicted <em>CYP2C19</em> extensive metabolizer or ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype (i.e., <em>*1/*1, *1/*17</em>, and <em>*17/*17</em>). If genotyping from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments&ndash;certified laboratory identifies a patient as a <em>CYP2C19</em> poor metabolizer (PM) (i.e., <em>*2/*2</em>), current literature supports the use of an alternative antiplatelet agent (e.g., prasugrel or ticagrelor) when not contraindicated clinically.</p>
<p>The most challenging patient population to address is the <em>CYP2C19</em> intermediate metabolizer (IM) phenotype (e.g., <em>*1/*2, *1/*3</em>, and <em>*2/*17</em>). IMs have higher on-treatment residual platelet activity on average as compared with extensive metabolizers, and ACS/PCI <em>CYP2C19*2</em> heterozygotes treated with clopidogrel have increased risks for serious adverse CV outcomes, including stent thrombosis (see Supplementary Materials and Methods online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Consequently, these data support switching to an alternative antiplatelet agent for IMs when not contraindicated. However, given the wide interindividual variability in residual platelet activity observed among clopidogrel-treated IMs, clinical judgment also taking into account other factors that may place an IM at increased risk of a CV event (or adverse bleeding event) must be considered to most effectively individualize therapy.</p>
<p>In addition, although these guidelines have been focused on <em>CYP2C19*2</em> and <em>*3</em>, many clinical genotyping platforms include other variant alleles (e.g., <em>*4</em>&ndash;<em>*8</em> and <em>*17</em>) that can alter a patient's predicted metabolizer phenotype interpretation (see Supplementary Table S5 online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). As mentioned above, the <em>*4&ndash;*8</em> alleles have strong <em>in vitro</em> evidence for complete loss of function of the <em>CYP2C19</em> enzyme. Consequently, when these alleles are identified among ACS/PCI patients treated with clopidogrel, they should be considered as influencing clopidogrel metabolism and clinical outcomes consistent with the <em>*2</em> loss-of-function allele.</p>

<p>To construct a <em>cytochrome P450</em> <em>(CYP)2C19</em> minor allele frequency table based on ethnicity, the PubMed database (1966 to January 2011) and Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to January 2011) were searched using the following criteria: ((CYP2C19 or 2C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity)) with filter limits set to retrieve "full-text" and "English" literature. Studies were considered for inclusion if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated; (2) either allele frequencies or alleles for <em>CYP2C19</em> genotypes were reported; (3) the method by which <em>CYP2C19</em> was genotyped appeared reliable; (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals; and (5) the study represented publication of novel data (no reviews or meta-analyses). In instances where genotype data from large cohorts of ethnically-diverse individuals were reported, without respect to ethnicity, studies were only considered if one ethnicity was &ge;95% of the majority.</p>
<p>The combined analysis grouped subpopulations based on the Human Genome Diversity Project-Centre Etude Polymorphism Humain (HGDP-CEPH) and included 7,970 Africans, 7,920 Americans, 36,030 East Asians, 121,808 Europeans, 2,140 Middle Easterns, 13,742 Oceanians, and 7,248 South/Central Asians.</p></div>

    <li>Genotype-directed therapy could identify patients who benefit most from alternative antiplatelet therapy. </li>
    <li>The potential benefits of <em>cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19</em> testing are that when considering treatment with clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients, genotypes that confer a higher risk of a CV event on clopidogrel can be identified, and an alternative antiplatelet strategy can be instituted. </li>
</ul>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19</em> loss-of-function alleles confer increased risks for serious adverse cardiovascular (CV) events among clopidogrel-treated patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). </li>
    <li>Some studies indicate that the common <em>CYP2C19*17</em> allele results in enhanced platelet inhibition and clopidogrel response and perhaps an increased risk of bleeding complications. </li>
    <li>Large meta-analyses have shown that clopidogrel-treated ACS patients undergoing PCI who are <em>CYP2C19*2</em> heterozygotes or homozygotes have an increased risk for major adverse CV events as compared with <em>*1</em> homozygotes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11&ndash;2.17 for heterozygotes; HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.24&ndash;2.50 for homozygotes) and increased risks of stent thrombosis (HR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.69&ndash;4.22 for heterozygotes; HR = 3.97, 95% CI = 1.75&ndash;9.02 for homozygotes). </li>
    <li>A lack of effect of <em>CYP2C19</em> loss-of-function alleles on adverse CV outcomes has been reported among clopidogrel-treated patients with lower clinical risks and/or other indications (e.g., atrial fibrillation, stroke). </li>
    <li>Although <em>CYP2C19</em> genotyping is straightforward and reliable when performed in qualified laboratories, as with any laboratory test, an additional possible risk to the patient is an error in genotyping. Because genotypes are lifelong test results, any such error could have adverse health implications for the life of the patient. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>Although there is mounting evidence associating deficient <em>cytochrome P450</em> <em>(CYP)2C19</em> with increased risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in clopidogrel-treated acute coronary syndrome (ACS)/percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients, the absence of randomized clinical trial evidence that <em>CYP2C19</em> genotyping improves outcomes must be acknowledged.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<p>If pursuing <em>CYP2C19</em> genotyping, one of the challenges is the need for rapid turnaround time of results. It would be advantageous to have the results before initiating antiplatelet therapy because the majority of potentially preventable recurrent events occur early in treatment. For example, among other clinical and genetic factors, <em>CYP2C19*2</em> has recently been associated with definite early stent thrombosis in a case&ndash;control study. Therefore, if <em>CYP2C19</em> genotype is not already known from prior testing, early testing and expedited reporting would be advantageous. To address this issue, point-of-care genetic testing systems have been developed (see Supplementary Materials and Methods online; see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), and some academic medical centers have deployed preemptive genotyping programs for selected patient populations.</p>
<p>Of note, as described above, these recommendations apply predominantly to ACS patients undergoing PCI. Current data do not support the use of <em>CYP2C19</em> genotype data to guide treatment in other scenarios. In addition, at the time of this writing, there are no data available on the possible role of <em>CYP2C19</em> in clopidogrel response in pediatric patient populations; however, there is no reason to suspect that <em>CYP2C19</em> variant alleles would affect clopidogrel metabolism differently in children as compared with adults.</p>

<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision making and to identify questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for all individual variations among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the health-care provider to determine the best course of treatment for a patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made solely by the clinician and the patient.
