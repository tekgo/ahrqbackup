<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with mammography screening studies that are followed by a diagnostic mammography, ultrasound of the breast, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast in an outpatient or office setting within 45 days.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>From the perspective of both clinical quality and efficiency, there are potentially negative consequences if the mammography follow-up rate is either too high or too low. A high cumulative dose of low-energy radiation can be a consequence of too many false-positive mammography follow-up studies. Radiation received from mammography may induce more cancers in younger women or those carrying deleterious gene mutations, such as <em>BRCA-1</em> and <em>BRCA-2</em>. Additional imaging and biopsies after a screening mammography can also result in overdiagnosis among patients who do not have breast cancer, increasing their anxiety and distress. Alternatively, inappropriately low follow-up rates may lead to delayed diagnoses or undetected cases of breast cancer (Oregon Health &amp; Science University, 2009).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>During the measure development process, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) completed testing of the measure's specifications, including evaluation of the measure's scientific acceptability and feasibility of implementation by a Technical Expert Panel. A dry run, evaluating measure performance at each facility eligible for public reporting, was performed prior to measure implementation; no major stakeholder concerns were raised about the specifications, feasibility, or usability at that time. CMS continues to monitor stakeholder inquiries for concerns about measure calculation or scientific acceptability; feedback received through this vehicle will feed into the measure update cycle, as appropriate. </p></div>
