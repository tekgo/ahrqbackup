<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The task force worked with medical librarians to determine appropriate search terms and to create search strategies for each guideline chapter. The National Library of Medicine and the Cochrane Library were searched for literature published between 1966 and October 2014. Task force members used the article inclusion/exclusion criteria described below to screen abstracts and provide a list of relevant articles for full-text review. Task force members were blinded to the selection of abstracts provided by other task force members. Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) staff compiled lists of manuscripts for full-text review and approval by all of the task force members, and these full-text articles were reviewed by all task force members. In addition, task force members also screened the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews for potentially relevant articles.</p>
<p><strong>Article Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Included articles must have met certain criteria, as detailed below. To reduce bias, these criteria were specified before conducting the literature searches. To be included in the review, an article had to meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Studies had to investigate pediatric (&lt;18 years of age) patients with non-synostotic plagiocephaly or brachycephaly. </li>
    <li>Studies with mixed patient populations and that combined the results of these patient groups must have enrolled &ge;80% of pediatric patients with plagiocephaly or brachycephaly. </li>
    <li>The study was a full article report of a clinical study. </li>
    <li>Studies had to have appeared in a peer-reviewed publication or a registry report. </li>
    <li>Studies had to enroll at least 10 patients (5 per treatment arm) for each distinct outcome measured. If it was a comparative study, a minimum enrollment of 5 patients per treatment arm for each outcome was necessary. </li>
    <li>The study involved humans. </li>
    <li>The study was published in or after 1966. </li>
    <li>The study presented results quantitatively. </li>
    <li>The study did not involve "in vitro," "biomechanical," or results performed on cadavers. </li>
    <li>The study was published in English. </li>
</ul>
<p>Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or guidelines developed by others were not considered as evidence to support this guideline. The task force screened the bibliographies of these publications to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the literature search results used for this guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Search Strategy for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with medical librarians to search PubMed and the Cochrane Library for the period from 1966 to October 2014 using the MeSH subject headings and PubMed search strategies provided in Appendix A of the full guideline (see "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Manual searches of bibliographies were also conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Article Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>The task force reviewed the titles and abstracts to identify studies addressing the effectiveness of physical therapy compared to other treatment modalities or no treatment for positional plagiocephaly. Studies in which there was no comparison group (uncontrolled) were excluded. The authors reviewed articles that met these criteria, and appropriate studies were selected for inclusion into an evidentiary table.</p>
<p><strong>Search Results</strong></p>
<p>The search returned 47 unique articles. Thirty-four were excluded based on a review of the abstract. Thirteen full-text papers were reviewed. Ten articles were rejected for the following reasons: lack of a comparison group, potential significant degree of confounding introduced by co-intervention(s), lack of assessment of physical therapy as an independent outcome measure, and comparison to a commercially unavailable orthotic device (see Figure 1 in the full version of the guideline [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The development of these guidelines was initiated by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the Section on Pediatric Neurosurgery in response to members' concerns about the variation in the diagnosis and treatment paradigms being utilized. A multidisciplinary team comprised of physician volunteers (clinical experts), a clinical guidelines expert, and medical librarians was convened to conduct a systematic search of the literature and prepare clinical guidelines on the topic of pediatric plagiocephaly. After initial discussions, the members of the Plagiocephaly Guideline Task Force (hereinafter referred to as "the task force") decided, a priori, that the 4 major sub-topics would include: imaging modalities in the diagnosis of plagiocephaly, repositioning, physical therapy, and molding orthoses (helmet therapy).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations Rating Scheme</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force used the methodologies endorsed by the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) to assign a strength of recommendation for each recommendation included in this guideline. Linking evidence to recommendations, through the utilization of evidentiary tables, has been endorsed by the American Medical Association (AMA), the CNS, and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). This process validates and supports the relationship between the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations.</p>
<p>Demonstrating the highest degree of clinical certainty, Class I evidence is used to support recommendations of the strongest type, defined as Level I recommendations. Level II recommendations reflect a moderate degree of clinical certainty and are supported by Class II evidence or strong consensus of Class III evidence. Level III recommendations denote clinical uncertainty supported by inconclusive or conflicting evidence or expert opinion.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Voting on the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force used voting among its members to approve the final recommendations, language, and strength of recommendations. The voting was used to ensure that the language of each recommendation accurately reflected the evidence and the strength of the evidence. All the recommendations in this review were approved following the first round of voting, and no further discussion was needed to finalize the recommendations. The voting technique is referred to as the nominal group technique. During the course of editing and finalization of the document, changes were made to allow recommendations to conform to the rules of evidence and language as described above. When this occurred, the changes were reviewed and approved by the group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Panel Consensus and Approval Process</span></strong></p>
<p>Topic teams were created from the task force based on expertise of the task force members with respect to each topic addressed within the review. Each group took part in literature selection, review of the literature, creation of the evidence tables, creation of the guideline, editing, and final review. The final draft of the guideline was then circulated to the entire task force for feedback, discussion, and ultimately approval.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The systemic review demonstrates physical therapy to be an effective treatment option for positional plagiocephaly. Class II evidence suggests physical therapy to be a superior treatment modality to repositioning in cases of severe plagiocephaly, and an equivalent treatment modality to a positioning pillow. Class III evidence suggests that physical therapy performed by a professional physical therapist can lead to more results over a shorter treatment time, and thus be more appropriate in the setting of severe plagiocephaly.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against the use of soft positioning pillows in the crib of an infant to ensure a safe sleeping environment; therefore, the plagiocephaly guidelines committee recommends using physical therapy over positioning devices.</p></div>
