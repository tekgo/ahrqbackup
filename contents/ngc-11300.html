Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI)</strong>: The recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory illness in children and adults are presented in the form of a table with a list of evidence-based recommendations and four algorithms, accompanied by detailed annotations. The algorithms are provided in the original guideline document at the ICSI Web site for Diagnosis and Treatment of Respiratory Illness in Children and Adults (see the "Guideline Availability" field). </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Viral Upper-Respiratory Infections</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Antibiotics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: The ICSI work group does not recommend antibiotics for treatment of common cold symptoms in children and adults. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong>: Low; <strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Strong </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Not treating with antibiotics eliminates the possible side effects of antibiotics such as nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions and <em>Clostridium Difficile</em> infection. In addition, better stewardship of antibiotics helps reduce potential for antibiotic resistance. </li>
    <li><strong>Harms</strong>: None </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Given that antibiotics do not help resolve viral infections, they are not indicated for treatment in viral infections such as common colds. There are no harms by not treating common colds with antibiotics. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Kenealy &amp; Arroll, 2013 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acute Pharyngitis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>: It is the consensus of the ICSI work group to NOT test for Group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in patients with modified Centor criteria scores less than three or when viral features like rhinorrhea, cough, oral ulcers and/or hoarseness are present. </p>
<p>Testing should generally be reserved for patients when there is a high suspicion for GAS and for whom there is intention to treat with antibiotics. This involves a shared decision-making conversation with patients and/or caregivers. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Judicious testing would reduce costs associated with over-testing. Shared-decision making discussions can help patients and/or caregivers understand the benefits and risks of testing and treatment. </li>
    <li><strong>Harms</strong>: Because fewer patients may be tested, there may be cases of GAS that are not diagnosed. It is unknown whether this would lead to increased complications. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: The benefit of more prudent testing and shared decision-making conversations about testing and/or treatment outweigh the possible harms. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Hersh et al., 2013; Pelucchi et al., 2012; Shulman et al., 2012 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p><em>Antibiotics</em> </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: It is the work group consensus that empirical antibiotic treatment of suspected GAS pharyngitis is not recommended. </p>
<p>There is inconclusive evidence regarding antibiotic treatment of GAS pharyngitis in low-risk patients (no history of rheumatic fever, no chronic or severe presentation of illness and/or immunocompromised). The work group recommends using shared decision-making with patients and/or caregivers to determine whether to test and treat with antibiotics. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong>: Moderate-High; <strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Strong </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Shared decision-making use will result in more prudent use of GAS testing and antibiotics. </li>
    <li><strong>Harms</strong>: Shared decision-making may lead to fewer patients being tested and/or treated. Those not treated may have longer symptom duration and increased risk of complications. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Antibiotic treatment of GAS reduces symptoms by one to three days and reduces complications. However, dangerous complications of GAS such as acute rheumatic fever and abscesses are rare, and antibiotics have the risk of side effects as well as creating bacterial resistance. Given these considerations, judicious use of testing and antibiotics based on shared decision-making conversations with patients and/or caregivers is appropriate. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Little et al., 2014; Spinks, Glasziou, &amp; Del Mar, 2013; Spurling et al., 2013; Kenealy, 2011; Robertson, Volmink, &amp; Mayosi, 2005; Zwart et al., 2000 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Infectious Rhinitis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Allergic Rhinitis</strong></p>
<p><em>Medications</em> </p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: The ICSI work group recommends intranasal corticosteroids as initial treatment for allergic rhinitis. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong>: High; <strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Strong </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Evidence shows that intranasal corticosteroids are very effective single agents for controlling the spectrum of allergic rhinitis symptoms in children and adults. They reduce the symptoms of nasal blockage, itching, sneezing and rhinorrhea. </li>
    <li><strong>Harms</strong>: The most common side effects of intranasal corticosteroids are nasal irritation (dryness, burning and crusting) and epistaxis. Nasal septal perforation has been reported. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Given the efficacy and relative safety of intranasal corticosteroids in controlling the spectrum of allergic rhinitis symptoms and relative to harms, which can be decreased by use of the proper technique for administration, the ICSI work group recommends intranasal corticosteroids as initial treatment for allergic rhinitis in children and adults. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Weiner, Abramson, &amp; Puy, 1998 </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Acute Sinusitis</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consensus Recommendation</strong>: To diagnose acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), the ICSI work group consensus is there are two clinical presentations where ABRS has a higher likelihood of being present: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Persistence of symptoms consistent with acute rhinosinusitis lasting 10 days or more without evidence of improvement </li>
    <li>Symptoms are worsening &ndash; new onset of fever, headache or increase in nasal discharge after a viral upper-respiratory infection (VURI) that lasted five to six days and the patient was initially improving (double worsening or double sickening) </li>
</ul>
<p>Clinical presentation of severe symptoms and high fever of 102&ordm;F for at least three to four days from onset of illness should not routinely be used as criteria to diagnose patients with bacterial sinusitis. The diagnosis of these patients should be made on an individualized basis depending on the entire clinical scenario </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Appropriately diagnosing ABRS based on clinical presentations decreases the likelihood of inappropriate treatment with antibiotics. Thus, side effects of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance are avoided. </li>
    <li><strong>Harms</strong>: Patients could potentially be misdiagnosed and might not get appropriate treatment for their condition. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Given the need for prudent antibiotic use, it is important that an appropriate diagnosis of ABRS is made. </li>
    <li><strong>Relevant Resources</strong>: Rosenfeld et al., 2015; Wald et al., 2013; Chow et al., 2012 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Consider symptomatic care as initial treatment for patients with suspected acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). </p>
<p>Consider prescribing a delayed or an immediate antibiotic based on degree of illness, comorbidities and after shared decision-making discussion with patients who meet criteria for ABRS. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong>: Moderate-High; <strong>Strength of Recommendation</strong>: Strong </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit</strong>: Benefits of prudent antibiotic use decrease the possibility of serious side effects of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance. </li>
    <li><strong>Harms</strong>: The recommendation leaves the treatment with antibiotics at clinician discretion. Not treating with antibiotics immediately or delaying treatment may prolong symptom duration and there is a possibility of complications from acute sinusitis. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefit-Harms Assessment</strong>: Considering small clinical benefit of antibiotic use (small reductions in duration of symptoms), the rarity of severe complications from acute rhinosinusitis and the potential for side effects of antibiotic use, antibiotics as initial treatment among immunocompetent adults with acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis may not be merited. Instead a delayed or an immediate antibiotic prescription strategy should be considered based on degree of illness, comorbidities and after shared decision-making discussion with patients who meet criteria for ABRS. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Literature Search</strong></span></p>
<p>A consistent and defined literature search process is used in the development and revision of the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) guidelines. Literature searches for this guideline were done in PubMed under following parameters: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Time frame: May 2012&ndash;February 2017 for all topics except antibiotic use for strep pharyngitis and pharmacologic treatment for allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. The time frame for these two topics included January 2005&ndash;April 2017. </li>
    <li>Types of studies searched for: systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (case-control, cohort and cross-sectional studies). </li>
    <li>Population: children and adults. </li>
    <li>All studies were published in English and included humans. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria </strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Article is out of scope &ndash; topic went into detail beyond what is being covered in the guideline. Information beyond the scope of the primary care clinician including but not limited to: comparisons within a drug class, detailed pharmacokinetics of medications, first-line vs. alternative medications, diagnosis and treatment for conditions that potentially overlap with upper respiratory conditions or complications from those conditions (e.g. influenza, otitis media). </li>
    <li>Article is not relevant &ndash; although it was captured in the search, the article actually dealt with something different and therefore was not relevant to the guideline. The article was included in the search results, however the focus of the article was not relevant. Despite best efforts, search terms will sometimes capture articles that do not coincide with the content that is desired. These exclusions represent the imperfect nature of search terms. These articles were excluded by ICSI staff and/or work group members. </li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed list of literature search terms by topic, see Appendix A in the original guideline document. </p>
<p>In addition to the literature searches, articles were obtained by work group members and ICSI staff. Those vetted by the work group were included in the guideline when appropriate.</p></div>

In addition, when GRADE methodology could not be applied, the work group developed consensus recommendations.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Document Development and Revision Process</span></strong></p>
<p>The development process is based on a number of long-proven approaches and is continually being revised based on changing community standards. The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) staff, in consultation with the work group and a medical librarian, conduct a literature search to identify systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials, meta-analysis, other guidelines, regulatory statements and other pertinent literature. This literature is evaluated based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology by work group members. When needed, an outside methodologist is consulted. </p>
<p>The work group uses this information to develop or revise clinical flows and algorithms, write recommendations, and identify gaps in the literature. The work group gives consideration to the importance of many issues as they develop the guideline. These considerations include the systems of care in the community and how resources vary, the balance between benefits and harms of interventions, patient and community values, the autonomy of clinicians and patients and more. All decisions made by the work group are done using a consensus process. </p>
<p>ICSI's medical group members and sponsors review each guideline as part of the revision process. They provide comment on the scientific content, recommendations and implementation strategies. This feedback is used by and responded to by the work group as part of their revision work. Final review and approval of the guideline is done by ICSI's Committee on Evidence-Based Practice. This committee is made up of practicing clinicians and nurses, drawn from ICSI member medical groups. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Recommendations and Measures</span></strong></p>
<p>These are provided to assist medical groups and others to implement the recommendations in the guidelines. Where possible, implementation strategies are included that have been formally evaluated and tested. Measures are included that may be used for quality improvement as well as for outcome reporting. When available, regulatory or publicly reported measures are included. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Document Revision Cycle</span></strong></p>
<p>Scientific documents are revised every 12 to 24 months as indicated by changes in clinical practice and literature. ICSI staff monitors major peer-reviewed journals every month for the guidelines for which they are responsible. Work group members are also asked to provide any pertinent literature through check-ins with the work group midcycle and annually to determine if there have been changes in the evidence significant enough to warrant document revision earlier than scheduled. This process complements the exhaustive literature search that is done on the subject prior to development of the first version of a guideline.</p></div>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Member Review</strong></span></p>
<p>All ICSI documents are available for member review at two points in the ICSI revision process. The ICSI Response Report is sent to members at the beginning of a document revision. The goal of this report is to solicit feedback about the guideline, including but not limited to the algorithm, content, recommendations, and implementation. At the end of the revision process, members are invited to provide feedback on the guideline. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Public Comment</strong></span></p>
<p>ICSI makes a draft of the guideline available to the public on the ICSI Web site. The public is invited to comment in an effort to get feedback prior to its finalization.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Invited Reviews</strong></span></p>
<p>For some guidelines, ICSI will invite experts in the community to comment on a guideline draft prior to finalization. This is done during the public comment period. </p>
<p>No invited review was done for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Respiratory Illness in Children and Adults guideline. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ICSI Patient Advisory Council (PAC)</strong></span></p>
<p>The ICSI Patient Advisory Council responds to any guideline review requests put forth by ICSI facilitators and work groups. The PAC members may be involved at the beginning, middle, and/or end of the revision process. Patient advisors who serve on the council consistently share their experiences and perspectives in either a comprehensive or partial review of a document. </p>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implementation Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>Prior to implementation, it is important to consider current organizational infrastructure that addresses the system and process design; training, education and culture; and the need to shift values, beliefs and behaviors of the organization. </p>
<p><strong>Antibiotic Stewardship Resources </strong></p>
<p>Inappropriate antibiotic use can lead to antibiotic resistance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), antibiotic resistance can lead to an estimated 2 million infections and 23,000 deaths per year in the United States. Additionally, antibiotics can lead to medication-related adverse events for patients taking them. One of every five visits to the emergency departments is due to adverse antibiotic drug reactions. An estimated 5% to 25% of patients who use antibiotics have an adverse event with about 1 in 1,000 having a serious adverse event. </p>
<p>Antibiotic overprescribing leads to the false perception that patients need antibiotics to feel well, while not taking into consideration the harms of overprescribing such as side effects and antibiotic resistance. The potential harms of antibiotic use make it especially important to use antibiotics judiciously. </p>
<p>The following resources on antibiotic stewardship in outpatient settings are available online: </p>
