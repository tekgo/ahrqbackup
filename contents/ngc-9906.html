<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the strength of the recommendations (<strong>Level A-C</strong>) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In patients facing infertility due to chemotherapy or other gonadotoxic therapies, oocyte cryopreservation is recommended with appropriate counseling (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>More widespread clinic-specific data on the safety and efficacy of oocyte cryopreservation in donor populations are needed before universal donor oocyte banking can be recommended (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>There are not yet sufficient data to recommend oocyte cryopreservation for the sole purpose of circumventing reproductive aging in healthy women (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>More data are needed before this technology should be used routinely in lieu of embryo cryopreservation (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
</ul>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Committee performed a systematic literature search using the MEDLINE site up to April 2012. In order to compare the efficacy (clinical pregnancy and live birth rates) of embryo transfers using fresh or cryopreserved/thawed oocytes, the search utilized combinations of medical subject headings "oocyte," "cryopreservation," "vitrification," "frozen," "birth," "delivery," and "pregnancy." In order to assess the safety of oocyte cryopreservation, the search included the terms "safe," "risk," "birth defect," "karyotype," and "abnormal" to the search. Only English language articles were selected, and the search was restricted to published articles. Review articles were included.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The consulting clinical epidemiologist presented to the Practice Committee an assessment of the evidence and a list of recommendations supported by the evidence. The Committee discussed the evidence and reviewed the consultant's recommendations. The document based on the recommendations approved by the Committee was written by an expert in the field who did not have relevant conflicts of interest. The document was reviewed by the Practice Committees of both the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, after which the Board of Directors and the members of the Society were given the opportunity to review the document and make suggestions and the appropriate modifications were made. The final document reflects the evidence-based consensus assessment by the Society.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Successful in vitro fertilization (IVF), pregnancy, and birth with cryopreserved oocytes </li>
    <li>No increase in chromosomal abnormalities, birth defects, and developmental deficits in the offspring born from cryopreserved oocytes when compared to pregnancies from conventional IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and the general population. </li>
    <li>Successful oocyte cryopreservation has the potential to simplify oocyte donation. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Most vitrification protocols use an "open" system, in which oocytes are directly exposed to liquid nitrogen to maximize ultra-rapid cooling and minimize ice crystal formation. A theoretical concern regarding such "open" systems is their potential to expose oocytes to infectious organisms present in contaminated liquid nitrogen. </li>
    <li>There are risks associated with ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval. Since embryo transfer is not being performed in most individuals cryopreserving oocytes, the risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) are very low. </li>
    <li>Studies suggest that implantation and pregnancy rates may be lower when frozen oocytes are used compared with fresh or frozen embryos. </li>
</ul>
