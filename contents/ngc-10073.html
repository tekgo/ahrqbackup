Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Four focused questions were developed for the systematic reviews of occupational therapy interventions for older adults with low vision. The questions were generated in conjunction with an advisory group of content experts in low vision within and outside of occupational therapy. The following focused questions from the review are included in this Practice Guideline:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What is the evidence for the effectiveness of environmental interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to maintain, restore, and improve performance in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) within the home for older adults with low vision? </li>
    <li>What is the evidence for the effectiveness of providing interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to improve the ability to use optical, nonoptical, and electronic magnifying devices to complete the reading required for performance of occupations by older adults with low vision? </li>
    <li>What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to improve the driving performance and community mobility of older adults with low vision? </li>
    <li>What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to maintain, restore, and improve performance in leisure and social participation for older adults with low vision? </li>
</ol>
<p>Search terms for the reviews were developed by the consultant to the American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Project and AOTA staff in consultation with the authors of each question and reviewed by the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to make sure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. Table C.2. in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to populations and interventions included in each systematic review. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted all searches and confirmed and improved the search strategies.</p>
<p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria are critical to the systematic review process because they provide the structure for the quality, type, and years of publication of the literature incorporated into a review. The review for all four questions was limited to peer-reviewed scientific literature published in English. It also included consolidated information sources such as the Cochrane Collaboration.</p>
<p>The literature included in the review was published from 1990 to 2010, and the study populations were older adults, primarily ages 65 years or older, with low vision. Studies included in the review were of intervention approaches within occupational therapy's domain and scope of practice. The review excluded data from presentations, conference proceedings, non&ndash;peer-reviewed research literature, dissertations, and theses. Only Level I, II, III evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field) was included in the reviews.</p>
<p>The consultant to the EBP project completed the first step of eliminating references on the basis of citation and abstract. The reviews were carried out as academic partnerships in which academic faculty worked with occupational therapy graduate students to carry out the reviews. Review teams completed the next step of eliminating references on the basis of further review of citations and abstracts. The full-text versions of potential articles were retrieved, and the review teams determined final inclusion in the review on the basis of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The teams working on each focused question reviewed the articles according to their quality (scientific rigor and lack of bias) and level of evidence. Each article included in the review then was abstracted using an evidence table that provides a summary of the methods and findings of the article and an appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the study on the basis of design and methodology.</p>
<p>The strength of the evidence is based on the guidelines of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (<a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/grades.htm" title="USPSTF Web site">http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/grades.htm</a>). The designation of<em> strong evidence </em>includes consistent results from well-conducted studies, usually at least two randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A designation of <em>moderate evidence</em> may be made on the basis of one RCT or two or more studies with lower levels of evidence. In addition, some inconsistency of findings across individual studies might preclude a classification of strong evidence. The designation of <em>limited evidence</em> may be based on few studies, flaws in the available studies, and some inconsistency in the findings across individual studies. A designation of <em>mixed</em> may indicate that the findings were inconsistent across studies in a given category. A designation of <em>insufficient evidence</em> may indicate that the number and quality of studies is too limited to make any clear classification.</p>
<p>Review authors also completed a Critically Appraised Topic (CAT), a summary and appraisal of the key findings, clinical bottom line, and implications for occupational therapy based on the articles included in the review for each question. American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) staff and the Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) project consultant reviewed the evidence tables and CATs to ensure quality control.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths and Limitations of the Systematic Reviews</strong></p>
<p>The systematic reviews presented in this Practice Guideline cover many aspects of occupational therapy practice for older adults with low vision and have several strengths. Four focused questions were included in the reviews, covering information related to several aspects of the domain of occupational therapy addressed in the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework (2nd ed.; AOTA, 2008). The reviews included 70 articles, and three-fourths of the articles were Level I and II evidence. The reviews involved systematic methodologies and incorporated quality control measures. Limitations of the studies incorporated in the reviews may include small sample size and lack of long-term follow-up. Depending on the level of evidence, the studies may lack randomization and a control group. In addition, separating out the effects of a single intervention that is part of a multimodal intervention is difficult. Also, many of the studies used outcome measures not specifically geared to the systematic review question, which may have obscured the ability to separate out the effect of the interventions studied on the targeted outcome.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 2009, both the American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) National Office and members expressed interest in developing an Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) guideline on occupational therapy for older adults with low vision because of the increased incidence of older adults with low vision and AOTA's interest in focusing on areas related to board and specialty certification. It was felt that the EBP guideline would provide occupational therapy practitioners with findings that would guide and support practice in this area. In addition, a practice guideline would be used to support the role of occupational therapy with external audiences. Four focused questions were developed for the systematic reviews of occupational therapy interventions for older adults with low vision. The questions were generated in conjunction with an advisory group of content experts in low vision within and outside of occupational therapy.</p></div>
