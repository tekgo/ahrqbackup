<p class="Note"><strong>*Note</strong>: Criteria for level of evidence are based on the standard language from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (2009). Suggested recommendations are based on the available evidence and content experts' clinical expertise regarding the value of using the intervention in practice.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes, and the balance of the benefits and harms may result either in a recommendation that occupational therapy practitioners routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients or in no recommendation as the balance of the benefits and harm is too close to justify a general recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&ndash;Recommend that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&ndash;Insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The following 5 focused questions from the review of interventions for children 0 through 5 years were included in this Practice Guideline:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><em>Social&ndash;emotional development</em>: What is the effectiveness for interventions used in occupational therapy to promote social&ndash;emotional development for children 0 through 5? </li>
    <li><em>Feeding, eating, and swallowing</em>: What is the evidence for the effectiveness for interventions used in occupational therapy to improve feeding, eating, and swallowing for children 0 through 5? </li>
    <li><em>Motor development</em>: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to improve motor performance for children 0 through 5? </li>
    <li><em>Cognitive development</em>: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to improve cognitive development for children 0 through 5? </li>
    <li><em>Service delivery model</em>: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of different service delivery models used to improve occupational performance for children 0 through 5 and families receiving early intervention and early childhood services? </li>
</ol>
<p>Search terms for the reviews were developed by the consultant to the American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) Evidence-Based Practice Project (EBP) and AOTA staff in consultation with the authors of each question and reviewed by the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to make sure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. Table C.2 in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to the population and interventions included in each systematic review. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted all searches and confirmed and improved the search strategies.</p>
<p>Databases and sites searched included Medline, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), and Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence (OTseeker). In addition, consolidated information sources, such as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Campbell Collaboration, were included in the search. These databases are peer-reviewed summaries of journal articles and provide a system for clinicians and scientists to conduct evidence-based reviews of selected clinical questions and topics. Moreover, reference lists from articles included in the systematic reviews were examined for potential articles, and selected journals were hand-searched to ensure that all appropriate articles were included.</p>
<p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria are critical to the systematic review process because they provide the structure for the quality, type, and years of publication of the literature incorporated into a review. The review of all five questions was limited to peer-reviewed scientific literature published in English. The review also included consolidated information sources such as the Cochrane Collaboration. Reports listed on ERIC were included for the service delivery question.</p>
<p>The literature included in the review had been published between 1990 and 2010, and the study samples were children birth to age 5 and eligible for early intervention services. The intervention approaches examined were within the scope of practice of occupational therapy. The review excluded data from presentations, conference proceedings, non-peer-reviewed research literature, dissertations, and theses. Studies included in the review are Level I, II, and III evidence. Level IV evidence was included only where higher level evidence on a given topic was not found (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p>
<p>The consultant to the EBP Project completed the first step of eliminating references based on citation and abstract. Except in one situation in which the author worked on the review independently, the reviews were carried out as academic partnerships in which academic faculty worked with graduate students. Review teams completed the next step of eliminating references based on citations and abstracts. The full-text versions of potential articles were retrieved, and the review teams determined final inclusion in the review based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The teams working on each focused question reviewed the articles according to their quality (scientific rigor and lack of bias) and levels of evidence. Each article included in the review was then abstracted using an evidence table that provides a summary of the methods and findings of the article and an appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the study based on design and methodology. American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) staff and an Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Project consultant reviewed the evidence tables to ensure quality control.</p>
<p>The strength of the evidence is based on the guidelines of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (<a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/grades.htm" title="USPSTF Web site">http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/uspstf/grades.htm</a>). The designation of "strong evidence" includes consistent results from well-conducted studies, usually at least two randomized controlled trials. A designation of "moderate evidence" may be based on one randomized controlled trial or two or more studies of lower levels of evidence. In addition, there may be some inconsistency of findings across individual studies that might preclude a classification of strong evidence. The designation of "limited evidence" may be based on few studies, flaws in the available studies, and some inconsistency in the findings across individual studies. A designation of "mixed" may indicate that the findings were inconsistent across studies in a given category. A designation of "insufficient evidence" may indicate that the number and quality of studies is too limited to make any clear classification.</p>
<p>Review authors also completed a Critically Appraised Topic, a summary and appraisal of the key findings, clinical bottom line, and implications for occupational therapy based on the articles included in the review for each question.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths and Limitations of the Systematic Reviews</strong></p>
<p>The 5 systematic reviews presented in this Practice Guideline have several strengths and include many aspects of occupational therapy practice for infants, toddlers, young children, and their families. The reviews included 112 articles, and three-fourths of the articles were Level I and II evidence, indicating that the evidence was of high quality. The reviews also involved systematic methodologies and incorporated quality control measures.</p>
<p>The limitations of the systematic reviews are based on the design and methods of individual studies and include small sample sizes and limited descriptions of the psychometric properties of a study's outcome measures. In addition, many of the studies in the review included concurrent interventions, and separating the effects of a single intervention may be difficult.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This study was initiated and supported by the American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA) as part of the Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Project. In 2007, a Representative Assembly (RA) motion was passed "to charge the President to direct the Executive Director to direct resources to conduct an evidence-based literature review on the effectiveness of Occupational Therapy Services and Early Intervention." The RA charge reflected the need for occupational therapy practitioners to access findings from systematic reviews to support interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice. In addition, the rationale for the RA charge was the increased incidence of childhood disorders and an interest in addressing barriers to early intervention occupational therapy services.</p>
<p>Four focused questions were initially developed for the systematic reviews of occupational therapy interventions for early intervention/early childhood and included questions related to social&ndash;emotional development; feeding, eating, and swallowing; preliteracy; and service delivery models. The questions were generated in conjunction with a group of content experts in early intervention/early childhood and EBP. Because of budget constraints, the project was put on hold until 2009. Following the review of the results of the search and development of summaries of the literature, the preliteracy question was divided into two questions, one examining intervention effects on motor outcomes and the other examining interventions that promote cognitive development related to preliteracy.</p></div>

Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes, and the balance of the benefits and harms may result either in a recommendation that occupational therapy practitioners routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients or in no recommendation as the balance of the benefits and harm is too close to justify a general recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&ndash;Recommend that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&ndash;Insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p></div>
