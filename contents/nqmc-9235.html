Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children who needed referrals and had a problem obtaining them, based on parents' response to the following items on the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>K5Q10: During the past 12 months/Since (his/her) birth, did [child] need a referral to see any doctors or receive any services?
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Response choices for the above question are "Yes," "No," "Don't know," and "Refused." </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>K5Q11: Was getting referrals a big problem, a small problem, or not a problem?
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Response choices for the above question are "Big problem," "Small problem," "Not a problem," "Don't know," and "Refused." </li>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Children who have problems getting referrals when they need them are at increased risk of lower health outcomes. Lack of access to care is consistently related to poorer health outcomes. Increasing access to referrals should have numerous benefits for improving the health of children, both directly and indirectly. </p>
<p>There is a broad range in the proportion of children who have problems obtaining referrals when needed. The range across states is 9.2% of children living in Georgia to 31.4% of children in California. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted testing of the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) to make sure the entire survey instrument was functioning properly. A total of 95,677 surveys were completed nationally for children between the ages of 0 and 17 years. The questionnaire was then revised and finalized based on feedback from participants in these interviews.</p>
<p>The Maternal and Child Health Bureau leads the development of the NSCH and National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) survey and indicators, in collaboration with the NCHS and a national technical expert panel. The expert panel includes representatives from other federal agencies, state Title V leaders, family organizations, and child health researchers, and experts in all fields related to the surveys (adolescent health, family and neighborhoods, early childhood and development, etc.). Previously validated questions and scales are used when available. Extensive literature reviewing and expert reviewing of items is conducted for all aspects of the survey. Respondents' cognitive understanding of the survey questions is assessed during the pretest phase and revisions made as required. All final data components are verified by NCHS and Data Resource Center/Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (DRC/CAHMI) staff prior to public release. Face validity is conducted in comparing results with prior years of the survey and/or results from other implementations of items. No specific reliability results are available for this measure.</p></div>
