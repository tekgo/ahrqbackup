Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of caregivers who reported that their family member was treated with respect.</p>
<p>The "Treating Family Member with Respect" composite measure is based on two questions on the CAHPS Hospice Survey that ask caregivers how often ("Never," "Sometimes," "Usually," "Always"):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>While your family member was in hospice care, how often did the hospice team treat your family member with dignity and respect? </li>
    <li>While your family member was in hospice care, how often did you feel that the hospice team really cared about your family member? </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The CAHPS Hospice Survey is used to assess the experiences reported by the informal caregivers (i.e., family members or friends) of patients who died while under hospice care. Hospices served an estimated 1.6 to 1.7 million patients in the United States in 2014, the vast majority of which are paid for by Medicare (National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization [NHPCO], 2015). Hospice use has steadily increased since the Medicare benefit was first established in 1982. </p>
<p>The survey asks informal caregivers about communication with the hospice team, timeliness of care, respect, emotional and spiritual support, symptom management, and hospice care training, domains that are critical to high-quality hospice care and that have been identified to be important to hospice patients and their families. </p>
<p>The CAHPS Hospice Survey is part of a family of CAHPS surveys that focuses on patient or caregiver experiences with health care. The CAHPS Hospice Survey presents primary caregivers (as identified by hospices) with a set of standardized questions about the hospice care they and their family member or friend received. The survey and associated methodology is intended to create reliable and valid data about hospice experiences that can be published on the web to help families choose hospices for their family members or friends, and to create incentives for quality improvement among hospice providers. </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In September 2012, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) entered into a contract with the RAND Corporation to design and field-test a future Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS&reg;) survey to measure the experiences that patients and their caregivers have had with hospice care. </p>
<p>As part of the development process for the CAHPS Hospice Survey, they conducted formative research including an environmental scan, focus groups, and individual interviews with primary caregivers of deceased hospice patients. The goal of the formative research was to determine elements of hospice care that were important to both patients and caregivers. Based on all of these inputs, a set of questions was developed and tested in cognitive interviews. CMS tested these questions and refined the list of items, and then conducted a field test. The field test included three similar versions of the survey which were differentiated by hospice care setting: 1. home, 2. nursing home and 3. in-patient setting (acute care hospital or freestanding hospice inpatient unit).</p>
<p>After the field test, the questionnaires were re-evaluated statistically and with additional cognitive testing. The setting-specific questions were consolidated into a single questionnaire for all settings that includes some setting-specific items.</p>
<p>For additional information, refer to the <em><a href="http://www.hospicecahpssurvey.org/globalassets/hospice-cahps3/home-page/hospice_field_test_report_2014.pdf" title="CAHPS Hospice Survey Web site">Hospice Experience of Care Survey Development and Field Test Report</a></em>. In this report, the developer briefly summarizes the work that they conducted to develop and field-test the new survey, referred to as the Hospice Experience of Care Survey during the field test and being implemented nationally as the CAHPS Hospice Survey beginning in 2015. The developer provides an overview of the survey development process, describes the field test design and procedures, presents analytic methods and findings from the field test, and discusses the implications of those findings for the final survey instrument for national implementation.</p>
<p>CMS submitted measures derived from the CAHPS Hospice Survey to the National Quality Forum (NQF) in spring 2016. As part of the NQF submission, CMS tested the measures' reliability and validity using data from 2,512 hospices that submitted data for Quarter 2 2015 national implementation. In October 2016, NQF endorsed the CAHPS Hospice Survey measures.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The CAHPS Hospice Survey results are adjusted for the effects of both mode of survey administration and case mix.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusting for Mode of Survey Administration</strong></p>
<p>Hospices participating in national implementation of the CAHPS Hospice Survey may choose from one of three modes of survey administration: Mail Only, Telephone Only, or Mixed Mode (mail with telephone follow-up). CMS conducted a randomized mode experiment in 2015 to assess the effect of mode on response rates and response patterns, and to determine whether survey mode adjustments were needed to fairly compare CAHPS Hospice Survey results for hospices that used different modes of data collection. The experiment found significant effects of survey mode on responses to several outcomes; therefore, to ensure fair comparisons across hospices, CAHPS Hospice Survey scores must be adjusted for mode of survey administration, which can affect scores but is not related to quality of hospice care.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusting for Case Mix</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that comparisons between hospices reflect differences in performance rather than differences in patient and/or caregiver characteristics, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) adjust responses for "case mix" (i.e., variations of such characteristics across hospices). The case-mix adjustment model includes the following variables:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Response percentile (calculated by ranking lag time&mdash;that is, days between death and survey response&mdash;among respondents for each hospice in each month, then dividing by total sample size) </li>
    <li>Decedent age </li>
    <li>Payer for hospice care </li>
    <li>Primary diagnosis </li>
    <li>Length of final episode of hospice care </li>
    <li>Respondent age </li>
    <li>Respondent education </li>
    <li>Relationship of decedent to caregiver </li>
    <li>Language </li>
</ul>
