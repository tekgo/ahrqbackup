Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to eliminate the number or rate of unintentionally retained foreign objects left following a vaginal delivery.</p>
<p>For as long as the medical community has been assisting women in performing vaginal deliveries, there has been the risk and misfortune of unintentionally retained foreign objects. Many measures have been instituted to mitigate the likelihood of an unintentionally retained item, but unfortunately they continue to occur.</p>
<p>Professional organizations such as The Joint Commission and Controlled Risk Insurance Company/Risk Management Foundation for Obstetrical Providers have developed guidelines for the prevention of retained items during vaginal deliveries. The Joint Commission categorizes the unintended retention of a foreign body after a vaginal delivery as a sentinel event. This categorization requires health care organizations to conduct a root cause analysis and to develop a corrective action plan designed to reduce the probability of a repeat occurrence.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Per The Joint Commission's Sentinel Event Report dated June 2011, unintentionally retained foreign objects were the most frequently reviewed category in 2010 and through the first half of 2011. In 2010 there were 133 events reported, which is up from 119 in 2009. Through the first half of 2011, 76 events were reported which, when annualized, would exceed the 2010 rate by nearly 20 events. </li>
    <li>In the first seven reporting periods (June 2003 to October 2010), the Minnesota Department of Health's Adverse Health Events Report showed 434 surgical events with 221 of those involving unintentionally retained foreign objects. In the most recent reporting period (October 2009 to October 2010), 34 unintentionally retained foreign objects were reported, three of which were sponges following vaginal delivery. </li>

    <li>Determine the number of total vaginal deliveries from unit logs or hospital billings. Out of that number, determine the number of deliveries that had baseline counts done. </li>
    <li>This information can also be collected by random sampling of patient charts to determine whether baseline counts were done. </li>

    <li>A sample size of 25 per month is recommended if collecting data through sampling. Can also look at the total number of vaginal deliveries. If less than 25 vaginal deliveries per month, use the total number of deliveries. </li>
