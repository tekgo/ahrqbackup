Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of venous ulcer who received education regarding the need for long term compression therapy including interval replacement of compression stockings within the 12 month reporting period.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Venous ulcers often recur, especially in patients who are not compliant with compression therapy, with rates as high as 70%. &quot;Numerous investigators have found that compliance is dependent on patient access to compression stockings and appropriate education.&quot; As a result, long term maintenance including the continued appropriate use of compression therapy must be addressed through patient education.</p>

<p class="Note">The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <u>verbatim</u> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:</p>

<p class="Note">Part of any prevention program must be patient education. This education should include the patient's individual skin care program, moisturizers, soaps and protective measures. The patient should be educated about the long term nature of this medical condition and the signs and symptoms of recurrence. There are many therapeutic modalities that have been shown to reduce the recurrence of lower extremity wounds includ[ing] graduated compression stockings (GCS) for patients with venous hypertension or at risk for venous insufficiency disease. (American Society of Plastic Surgeons [ASPS], 2007)</p>

<p class="Note">Patients with healed or surgically repaired venous ulcers should use compression stockings constantly and forever. (Wound Healing Society [WHS], 2006)</p>

<p class="Note">Compression stockings or other compression devices must be worn for the prevention of venous edema and venous leg ulcer recurrence. It is recommended that patients understand that compression therapy is needed for the rest of their lives [including the need to] apply compression stockings upon first rising in the morning, replace stockings regularly&#8212;about every 3 months&#8212;to provide optimal compression, have someone correctly measure stockings, which should include ankle circumference, length of leg from foot to knee, and midcalf circumference. These measurements should be done in the morning before edema occurs. Knee-length stockings are generally recommended. (Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses Society [WOCN], 2005)</p>

<p class="Note">Compression, elevation, ambulation post healing [are recommended] to prevent recurrence. (Association for the Advancement of Wound Care [AAWC], 2005)</p></div>
