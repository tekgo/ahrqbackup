Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure assesses physical functional health status of patients who received outpatient rehabilitation through the use of self-report health status questionnaires. Because the measures are taken at intake, during, and at discharge from rehabilitation, change in physical functional health status can be assessed. Measure results are available in Outcomes Profile Reports, which provide 1) information for clinicians to help direct and improve the care of their patients in real time during treatment, and 2) once treatments are complete a comparison of the clinician's or facility's outcomes and the National Aggregate in the FOTO&#174; Database.</p>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Collection of outcomes following clinical treatment is now commonplace in rehabilitation. (Hart 2002) Clinicians use outcomes to track changes in their patients to assess if the patient is improving with a specific treatment, (Jette &amp; Delitto 1997) if treatment needs to be changed or terminated, (Jette &amp; Jette 1997) and if the patient needs to be referred to another clinician or service. (Jette &amp; Jette 1997) Administrators use outcomes to compare their department's success with other similar departments, to market the department's services, to manage resources required to deliver their clinical services, and to manage their clinicians. (Marino 1997) Researchers analyze outcomes data for a variety of reasons including directing clinical education needs of providers, identifying clinical experts, etc. (Resnik &amp; Hart 2003) The federal government has mandated the collection of outcomes for post-acute rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes and in patient rehabilitation hospitals, and the government has directed the development of patient assessment instruments designed to collect outcomes. (Johnson 2001)</p>
<p>The process of outcomes management is evolving, and now many consider collection of functional status and health and well being the gold standard of outcomes measurement. Patient self-report of health status instruments, which quantify the client's perception of their functional abilities and health and well-being in standardized terms, have been recommended as outcomes tools for effectiveness research studies in rehabilitation. Standardized functional health status measures facilitate assessment of quality and value of clinical care. (Hart 2001)</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Musculoskeletal impairments account for a larger percentage of conditions for which medical care is sought in the United States (U.S.), and a large proportion of the cost associated with this care is related to the disability caused by these impairments. In 1984, Cunningham and Kelsey reported the overall prevalence of musculoskeletal impairments using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I. In the U.S., 32.6% of persons between the ages of 25 and 74 years were affected by some type of physician-observed musculoskeletal impairment, and 29.7% of the population had self-reported musculoskeletal impairments. Impairments related to the spine had the highest prevalence. In the National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES), about 20% of the 1980 noninstitutionalized population reported having a musculoskeletal problem involving the back or joints that resulted in some type of disability or use of the health care system. </li>
    <li>In the United States (U.S.), 10.9% of all medical office visits are primarily for musculoskeletal pathology or impairments, with 2% of all visits for back symptoms. </li>
    <li>The National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES) indicated that 13.3% of total charges for treatment of musculoskeletal conditions was attributed to care given by health care professionals other than physicians, including physical therapists. The cost of health care related to the treatment of musculoskeletal impairments accounted for 8% of total health care expenditures in 1980, ranking third among health problems in terms of costs for civilian noninstitutionalized individuals. </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Physical Functional Health Status (FHS) measure uses an ever expanding item bank of physical functioning items developed by cocalibrating existing health status questionnaires and new items using Item Response Theory mathematics. Original work described a 36 item bank (FHS-36) of physical functioning that used a set of hierarchically structured items representing a broad underlying construct applicable to patients in outpatient centers and postacute rehabilitation facilities. The hierarchical structure of the physical FHS-36 was clinically logical and had construct validity. Items fit together to define a single variable of physical functioning, which supported the measure's content validity and unidimensionality. Studies are ongoing to expand the item bank by adding more condition-specific items designed to increase measure precision while reducing respondent burden.</p></div>
