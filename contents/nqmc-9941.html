Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients 18 to 85 years of age who had a diagnosis of hypertension and whose blood pressure (BP) was adequately controlled during the measurement year based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Patients 18 to 59 years of age whose BP was less than 140/90 mm Hg </li>
    <li>Patients 60 to 85 years of age with a diagnosis of diabetes whose BP was less than 140/90 mm Hg </li>
    <li>Patients 60 to 85 years of age without a diagnosis of diabetes whose BP was less than 150/90 mm Hg </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Use the Hybrid Method for this measure. A single rate is reported and is the sum of all three groups.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Approximately 67 million Americans have high blood pressure (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). Treatment to improve hypertension includes dietary and lifestyle changes, as well as appropriate use of medications. </p>
<p>The specifications for this measure are consistent with current clinical guidelines, such as those of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the Joint National Committee (James et al., 2014).</p></div>

Patients 18 to 85 years of age as of December 31 of the measurement year with at least one outpatient visit (Outpatient CPT Value Set) with a diagnosis of hypertension (HTN) (Essential Hypertension Value Set) during the first six months of the measurement year</p>
<p>To confirm the diagnosis, the organization must find notation of one of the following in the medical record on or before June 30 of the measurement year:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>HTN </li>
    <li>High blood pressure (HBP) </li>

</ul>
<p>It does not matter if hypertension was treated or is currently being treated. The notation of hypertension may appear anytime on or before June 30 of the measurement year, including prior to the measurement year.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Diabetes Flag</em>: After the Eligible Population is identified, assign each patient a flag to identify if the patient does or does not have diabetes as identified by claims/encounter and pharmacy data (as described below). The flag is used to determine the appropriate BP threshold to use during numerator assessment (the threshold for patients with diabetes is different than the threshold for patients without diabetes). </p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Assign a flag of <strong><em>diabetic</em></strong> to patients who were identified as diabetic using claim/encounter data or pharmacy data. Use both methods to assign the diabetes flag, although a patient only needs to be identified by one method. Patients may be identified as having diabetes during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><em>Claim/encounter data</em>. Patients who met any of the following criteria during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year (count services that occur over both years):
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>At least two outpatient visits (Outpatient Value Set), observation visits (Observation Value Set), ED visits (ED Value Set) or nonacute inpatient encounters (Nonacute Inpatient Value Set) on different dates of service, with a diagnosis of diabetes (Diabetes Value Set). Visit type need not be the same for the two visits. </li>
            <li>At least one acute inpatient encounter (Acute Inpatient Value Set) with a diagnosis of diabetes (Diabetes Value Set). </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><em>Pharmacy data</em>. Patients who received a prescription or were dispensed insulin or hypoglycemic/antihyperglycemics on an ambulatory basis during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year (refer to Table ACDC-A in the original measure documentation for a list of prescriptions to identify members with diabetes). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Assign a flag of <strong><em>not diabetic</em></strong> to patients who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes (Diabetes Value Set), in any setting, during the measurement year or year prior to the measurement year and who meet either of the following criteria:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>A diagnosis of polycystic ovaries (Polycystic Ovaries Value Set), in any setting, any time during the patient's history through December 31 of the measurement year. </li>
        <li>A diagnosis of gestational diabetes or steroid-induced diabetes (Diabetes Exclusions Value Set), in any setting, during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Exclude from the eligible population all patients with evidence of end stage renal disease (ESRD) (ESRD Value Set; ESRD Obsolete Value Set) or kidney transplant (Kidney Transplant Value Set) on or prior to December 31 of the measurement year. Documentation in the medical record must include a dated note indicating ESRD. Documentation of ESRD, dialysis or renal transplant meets the criterion for evidence of ESRD. </li>
    <li>Exclude from the eligible population all patients with a diagnosis of pregnancy (Pregnancy Value Set) during the measurement year. Documentation in the medical record must include a note indicating a diagnosis of pregnancy, which must have occurred during the measurement year. </li>
    <li>Exclude from the eligible population all patients who had a nonacute inpatient admission during the measurement year. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Value Set Information</strong><br />
Measure specifications reference value sets that must be used for HEDIS reporting. A value set is the complete set of codes used to identify the service(s) or condition(s) included in the measure.

<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Representative BP</em>: The most recent BP reading during the measurement year (as long as it occurred after the diagnosis of hypertension was made). If multiple measurements occur on the same date, or are noted in the chart on the same date, the lowest systolic and lowest diastolic reading should be used.
