Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: The original guideline document provides guidance for preventing patient and health care worker injury from ionizing radiation exposure during therapeutic, diagnostic, or interventional procedures performed in the perioperative environment. Guidance for low-dose-rate and high-dose-rate brachytherapy using ionizing radiation is included. The guidance applies to patients, perioperative team members, and the caregivers of patients who receive brachytherapy or other radioactive therapeutic implants.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;" start="1">
    <li>A radiation safety program must be established in all facilities and health care organizations in which the potential for diagnostic or therapeutic radiation exposure exists. </li>
    <li>The perioperative team should implement measures to minimize the patient's exposure to radiation. </li>
    <li>Occupational exposure to radiation should be minimized. </li>
    <li>Personnel with a known or suspected pregnancy must restrict the occupational radiation dose as described in local, state, and federal regulations. </li>
    <li>Shielding devices, including architectural (i.e., fixed) shielding, equipment-mounted or mobile shields, and personal protective devices should be used with all sources of radiation. </li>
    <li>Radiation monitors or dosimeters must be worn by personnel as required by regulatory agencies. </li>
    <li>The principles of time, distance, and shielding should be followed by personnel handling therapeutic radionuclides and by personnel caring for patients who have received therapeutic radionuclides. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The authors reviewed international articles from the 1970s, articles published between 1990 and 2008 identified in a MEDLINE&reg; search, and additional articles acquired from citations in the literature.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic search of the MEDLINE&reg; and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL&reg;) databases and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized trials and studies, case reports, letters, reviews, and guidelines. The librarian also searched the Scopus&reg; database, although not systematically. The search was limited to literature published in English from January 2006 through January 2014.</p>
<p>Search terms included <em>invasive procedures, interventional procedure, interventional radiography, interventional radiology, intraoperative radiotherapy, cardiac catheterization, heart catheterization, abdominal radiography, radiation, ionizing radiation, iodine radioisotopes, radioactive tracer, radiation safety officer, safety management, radiation safety procedures, risk assessment, occupational radiation dose, occupational diseases, occupational exposure, occupational health, occupational hazards, radioprotection, radiation protection, radiation safety precautions, protective clothing, protective gloves, protective devices, eye protective devices, goggles, glasses, lead shield, lead apron, leaded garment, equipment failure, radiation injuries, patient safety, radiation monitoring, radiopharmaceuticals, radioactive pollutants, radioactive waste, medical waste, medical waste disposal, radiation field, storage, handling, transport, hazardous waste, occupational accident, thermoluminescent dosimetry, dosimeter, radiometry, staff dose, fetus, fertility, gonads, pregnancy,</em> and <em>pregnancy outcomes</em>.</p>
<p>These terms were searched in combination with terms such as <em>healthcare facility, health care facility, ambulatory care facility, surgicenter, ambulatory surgery, outpatient surgery, operating room personnel, interventionalist, surgeon, nurse, anesthesiologist, anaesthesiologist, operator, operating room, operating theater, operating suite,</em> and <em>surgical suite</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of the search, the librarian established weekly alerts on the search topics and until July 2014, presented relevant results to the lead author. During the development of this document, the lead author also requested supplementary literature searches and additional literature that either did not fit the original search criteria or was discovered during the evidence-appraisal process. The time restriction was not considered in these subsequent searches. Relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies also were identified.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, relevance to the key questions, and publication dates within the time restriction unless none were available. Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications, literature that examined radiation safety measures that were determined to be beyond the scope of this document (e.g., columnation, methods to decrease fluoroscopy time), and literature outside the time restriction when literature within the time restriction was available. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher-quality evidence was available.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and studies that addressed moderate sedation, regional anesthesia, pediatric patients, or pregnant patients. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher-quality evidence was available.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The methodology of the research and non-research evidence used to support this guideline was critically evaluated by the authors for validity and generalizability to current practice. The collective evidence supporting each intervention within a specific recommendation was summarized, and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Evidence-Rating Model was used to rate the strength of the collective evidence. Factors considered in the review of the collective evidence were the quality of the evidence, the quantity of similar evidence on a given topic, and the consistency of the evidence supporting a recommendation.</p></div>
