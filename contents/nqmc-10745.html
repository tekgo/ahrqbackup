Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of individuals 18 years of age and older who were obese (body mass index [BMI] greater than or equal to 30), with at least one interactive contact specific to weight loss, who either reduced their BMI or maintained their BMI.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure offers a standardized definition of risk reduction for individuals who participate in health promotion programs. Specifically, this measure focuses on body mass index (BMI) reduction or maintenance. </p>
<p>Several kinds of worksite programs and community interventions can impact BMI. There is strong evidence demonstrating that worksite programs that are intended to improve diet and/or physical activity behaviors reduce weight among employees (The Guide to Community Preventive Services, 2007). There is also sufficient evidence that technology-supported multicomponent coaching or counseling interventions intended to reduce or maintain weight effectively improve weight-related behaviors or weight-related outcomes (The Guide to Community Preventive Services, 2009).</p></div>
