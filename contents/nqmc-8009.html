<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients age 18 years and over initially presenting with acute symptoms of ischemic stroke who undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan within 25 minutes of arrival in the emergency department.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients age 18 years and over receiving appropriate thrombolytic and appropriate antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke (tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] and aspirin, other antiplatelet agents, or an anticoagulant).</p>
<p>Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, recently dropping from third after decades long efforts to reduce incidence by treatment of risk factors. It remains the leading cause of disability among adults. Costs of hospitalizations, other cares and lost wages are simply enormous.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendation for the timing of "door to initiation of computed tomography [CT] scan" for thrombolytic candidates is within 25 minutes.</p></div>
