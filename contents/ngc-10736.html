<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>In patients with Wagner Grade 2 or lower diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), the committee suggests against using hyperbaric oxygen (HBO<sub>2</sub>) therapy (<strong>very low-level evidence in support of HBO<sub>2</sub>, conditional recommendation</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with Wagner Grade 3 or higher DFUs that have not shown significant improvement after 30 days of treatment, the committee suggests adding HBO<sub>2</sub> to the standard of care to reduce the risk of major amputation and incomplete healing (<strong>moderate-level evidence, conditional recommendation</strong>). </li>
    <li>In patients with Wagner Grade 3 or higher DFUs who have just had a surgical debridement of an infected foot (e.g., partial toe or ray amputation; debridement of ulcer with underlying bursa, cicatrix or bone; foot amputation; incision and drainage [I&amp;D] of deep space abscess; or necrotizing soft tissue infection), the committee suggests adding acute post-operative HBO<sub>2</sub> to the standard of care to reduce the risk of major amputation and incomplete healing (<strong>moderate-level evidence, conditional recommendation</strong>). </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>The committee identified published systematic reviews of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO<sub>2</sub>) therapy for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and cross-referenced them to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OBSs) of interest (see Table 4 in the original guideline document). OBSs included any non-randomized comparative studies using either historical or contemporary control groups. The committee decided to include OBSs because the number of available RCTs was small and was unlikely to answer all the questions about the various types of patients included in the scope of this guideline. The committee then performed a subsequent librarian-assisted search of the Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases to identify if there were any RCTs that were not included in the published systematic reviews. Search dates included articles published up through April 2015. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were used. The keywords "leg ulcers," "diabetes" and "hyperbaric oxygenation" were used, along with their synonyms. A detailed search strategy is included in Appendix A of the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trial Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Titles and abstracts from the search results were independently reviewed by two panelists to select potentially relevant articles. The inclusion criteria were RCTs comparing patients with DFUs with a control group. The committee eliminated studies if they did not include the populations as defined by the Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes (PICO) questions, if they did not include the outcomes of interest, or if they did not include a comparison group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The review committee identified nine RCTs and 21 OBSs for initial review. The subsequent formal review included 655 references but did not identify any additional RCTs that were not previously identified from the systematic reviews. Studies were eliminated from consideration if they did not report data on the outcomes of interest or did not include patients in the specific study populations (see Table 9 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p>Two of the OBSs may have had overlapping datasets, so only the larger data set was evaluated.</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Two panelists independently extracted the data using predetermined criteria and presented the summary of evidence to the remainder of the panel to reach consensus. The committee attempted to contact authors of studies to obtain original trial data if the committee could not identify clear patient groups, but they did not receive any replies to their inquiries.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical Techniques</span></strong></p>
<p>Meta-analysis of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OBSs) was carried out using the Revman software package (Review Manager, version 5.2). A description of statistical terms is provided in Table 5 of the original guideline document. The committee pooled outcome data using the number of events and sample size of the control and experimental groups reported in published manuscripts. The results were depicted in a forest plot showing the individual effect sizes as well as the weighted pooled summary effect size with confidence intervals. The committee calculated the I<sup>2</sup> as a measure of heterogeneity. The I<sup>2</sup> statistic represents the proportion of variability that is attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance or random error. The higher the I<sup>2</sup> statistic is, the greater the degree of heterogeneity. When heterogeneity was judged to be substantial, the committee rated down the quality of evidence. There is no specific I<sup>2</sup> cutoff point above which the evidence is rated down for heterogeneity. An arbitrary cutoff of 50% is often used, but this is paired with a judgment of whether the majority of studies support a specific action and whether the observed heterogeneity is clinically meaningful (i.e., a very high I<sup>2</sup> may not be important if the difference in effect size is not clinically important across studies).</p>
<p>The committee presented results using risk ratios (i.e., relative risk) for binary outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Peto odds ratio was used when events were rare (small or zero events). Considering the heterogeneity of available studies, the committee decided <em>a priori</em> to use the random effects model for meta-analysis. The random effects model takes into account the variation in effect size between studies. In cases where there was only one study to analyze, the committee calculated a simple odds ratio and confidence interval.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rate Quality of Evidence for Each Outcome</span></strong></p>
<p>The committee constructed summary of evidence tables and assessed the risk of bias of the studies. Whenever possible, the committee used intention-to-treat analysis (even if the original manuscripts did not report it in this manner) by using a worst-case scenario assuming healing in the control group and failure to heal in the study group. This data matrix allowed reviewers to extract evidence profiles for each of the five outcomes from the entire body of literature. RCTs and OBSs were both analyzed, and the body of literature (RCT vs. OBS) with the highest level of evidence was used for decision-making. If there was equivalent level of evidence and the magnitude of effect was similar, the RCTs and OBSs were analyzed together. If there was equivalent level of evidence but the magnitude of effect was dissimilar, only the RCT studies were used.</p>
<p>The committee applied the relevant factors outlined in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the quality of evidence up (more reliable) or down (less reliable) (see Table 6 in the original guideline document), and assigned a final rating for each outcome for each Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes (PICO) question. In many analyses, the effect size was large or very large (i.e., two to five times reduction in relative effect). The committee opted to rate up only one level (as opposed to two for very large effect). It is also reasonable to not rate up in the presence of factors that lead to rating down. This decision is explicit in the tables that describe the committee's judgments and process. This semi-quantitative "score" corresponds to an overall quality of evidence rating using the four-tiered GRADE quality levels (very low; low; moderate; and high) (see Table 7 in the original guideline document).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oversight Committee</span></strong></p>
<p>The Oversight Committee consisted of a representative from the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) Board of Directors, the UHMS Oxygen Therapy Committee, the UHMS Quality, Utilization, Authorization and Reimbursement Committee, the UHMS Publications Committee, the UHMS International Membership, and a member of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. The Oversight Committee is tasked with the development of a series of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the appropriate use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO<sub>2</sub>). The Oversight Committee invites potential members of the CPG review committee based on individual areas of expertise, which may or may not include HBO<sub>2</sub>. The Oversight Committee reviews curriculum vitae of potential members and evaluates each candidate for potential conflicts of interest using responses to a questionnaire detailing the potential reviewers' financial interests involving the HBO<sub>2</sub> indication in question.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Review Committee</span></strong></p>
<p>CPG review committee members were oriented to the review process and GRADE methodology using slide presentations, reading lists and webcasts. Review committee members were then asked to participate in the multi-step process.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formulation of Questions and Selection of Outcomes</span></strong></p>
<p>The first task of the Review Committee is to create a list of clinically relevant questions to be answered in the guideline. These questions are created using the Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes (PICO) format. This approach allows for the creation of a clearly defined patient population, an intervention to be compared with an alternative treatment, and a set of clinical outcomes rated on a nine-point scale defining that outcome as critical, important, or not important.</p>
<p>The term "standard wound care" is meant to represent the optimal management of surgical debridement, mechanical offloading, infection control, revascularization and metabolic control. Pre-HBO<sub>2</sub> treatment of Wagner Grade 3 and 4 diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) is assumed to include surgical excision of all devitalized tissues. These four questions were formulated by the Review Committee:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>For a patient with a DFU, is HBO<sub>2</sub> with standard wound care more effective than standard wound care alone for the outcomes of interest? </li>
    <li>For a patient with a Wagner Grade 2 or lower DFU that has not shown significant improvement after 30 days of treatment, is HBO<sub>2</sub> with standard wound care more effective than standard wound care alone for the outcomes of interest? </li>
    <li>For a patient with a Wagner Grade 3 or higher DFU that has not shown significant improvement after 30 days of treatment, is HBO<sub>2</sub> with standard wound care more effective than standard wound care alone for the outcomes of interest? </li>
    <li>For a patient with a Wagner Grade 3 or higher DFU who has just had a surgical debridement of the foot (e.g., partial toe or ray amputation; debridement of ulcer with underlying bursa, cicatrix or bone; foot amputation; incision and drainage [I&amp;D] of deep space abscess; or necrotizing soft tissue infection), is acute postoperative HBO<sub>2</sub> with standard wound care more effective than standard wound care alone for the outcomes of interest? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formulating Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>A final rating of the quality of evidence (across all outcomes) was given based on the critical outcome with the lowest level of evidence. The Review Committee then formulated recommendations for each PICO question. This step required assigning a level of strength for each recommendation using the two-tiered GRADE levels (conditional or strong) (see Table 8 in the original guideline document). The final recommendations were agreed upon by consensus.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Patient Engagement</span></strong></p>
<p>Two groups of patients with DFU were invited to participate in the formulation of this guideline. Both patients who had received HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy and patients who had not received HBO<sub>2</sub> were included. The first group was recruited from a wound and hyperbaric medicine clinic to answer an online survey rating the outcomes selected by the Review Committee using a nine-point scale. This activity was approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The second group was recruited from a wound and hyperbaric medicine clinic to attend a face-to-face meeting with members of the Review Committee using video conferencing technology. The CPG development process and recommendations were presented to the patients. The Review Committee solicited patient perspective on multiple issues ranging from their fears and concerns at their initial consultation to their view of the successes and failures of their treatment course. The values, opinions and perspectives of these patients are reported in the original guideline document.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost-effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p>Few studies have been published regarding the cost-effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO<sub>2</sub>) therapy in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). One author reported in a cohort study of 41 patients that the estimated cost (in 1991 dollars) of below-knee amputation (US$40,000) plus rehabilitation (US$30,000) was greater than the cost of HBO<sub>2</sub> to salvage a limb (US$31,265). Another author reported 2003-2004 Australian data that the average cost for wound care and HBO<sub>2</sub> was AUS$14,928 for each amputation prevented, and that HBO<sub>2</sub> might decrease the overall cost of healthcare when the costs of amputation and rehabilitation were considered. One study used 2008 Canadian data on DFU prevalence and HBO<sub>2</sub> efficacy data to create a computer model that estimated the 12-year cost for patients receiving HBO<sub>2</sub> was CND$40,695, compared with CND$49,786 for standard care alone. This study concluded that adjunctive HBO<sub>2</sub> for DFU was cost-effective when compared to standard care. Only a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) prospectively addressed the cost-effectiveness of the use of HBO<sub>2</sub> in the treatment of DFUs. This study evaluated the cost of ulcer dressings per visit per patient for one year in both the treatment and control groups and found an average savings of UK&pound;2,960 per patient treated with HBO<sub>2</sub>. This analysis took into account the additional costs of HBO<sub>2</sub> and treatment of any associated complications. The Review Committee was unable to obtain the raw data for this study to include it in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) analysis.</p>
<p>Due to recent trends in insurance coverage and reimbursement policies, the cost-effectiveness of HBO<sub>2</sub> is likely to become an important factor in any discussions focusing on the use of HBO<sub>2</sub> in clinical practice. Cost-effectiveness studies are often conducted using decision modeling and simulations (e.g., Markov, Monte Carlo) due to the complex economic variables and uncertainty involved. Thus, it is somewhat challenging to interpret the significance of cost-effectiveness data using these existing studies.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There are obviously some adverse events that are solely related to hyperbaric oxygen (HBO<sub>2</sub>) and would not be seen in patients treated with alternative therapies (i.e., barotrauma, central nervous system oxygen toxicity, hyperoxic myopia). Data from one management company revealed 463,293 monoplace hyperbaric chamber treatments of 17,267 patients from 2009-2010. In 2009, there were 916 adverse events reported for 207,479 treatments in 7,781 patients (adverse event rate of 0.44%), and in 2010 there were 954 adverse events reported for 255,814 treatments in 9.296 patients (adverse event rate of 0.37%). In order of decreasing rate of occurrence were ear pain (20 per 10,000 treatments), confinement anxiety (eight per 10,000), hypoglycemic events (five per 10,000), shortness of breath (two per 10,000), seizures (two per 10,000), sinus pain (one per 10,000), and chest pain (one per 10,000). Overall, the risk of adverse events from HBO<sub>2</sub> can be considered to be very low and self-limited when they do occur.</p></div>
