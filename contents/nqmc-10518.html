<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. More than 85 million American adults have one or more types of cardiovascular disease (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). It is estimated that by 2030, more than 43 percent of Americans will have a form of cardiovascular disease (Heidenreich et al., 2011). In 2011, the total cost of cardiovascular disease and stroke in the United States was estimated to be $320 billion. This total includes direct costs such as the cost of physicians and other health professionals, hospital services, prescribed medications and home health care, as well as indirect costs due to loss of productivity from premature mortality. </p>
<p>Interventions to address cardiovascular disease are increasing: since 2000, the number of inpatient cardiovascular operations and procedures increased by 28 percent, from 5,939,000 to 7,588,000 (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). By 2030, direct medical costs for cardiovascular disease are projected to increase to nearly $918 billion (Heidenreich et al., 2011). </p>
<p>Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors) are a class of drugs that lower blood cholesterol. Statins work in the liver by preventing the formation of cholesterol, thus lowering the amount of cholesterol in the blood (American Heart Association [AHA], 2014). Statins are most effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The amount of cholesterol-lowering effect is based on statin intensity, which is classified as either high, moderate or low. </p>
<p>Statins are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States, accumulating $17 billion in sales in 2012 (Consumer Reports, 2014). According to recent blood cholesterol treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and AHA, statins of moderate or high intensity are recommended for adults with established clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Many studies support the use of statins to reduce ASCVD events in primary and secondary prevention. </p>
<p>One meta-analysis of data from 170,000 patients in 26 randomized controlled trials found that intensive statin therapy reduces major vascular events by 15 percent (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' [CTT] Collaboration, 2010). The study also found a 13 percent reduction in coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, a 19 percent reduction in coronary revascularization and a 16 percent reduction in ischemic stroke (CTT Collaboration, 2010). </p>
<p>Another systematic review and meta-analysis estimates that long term statin therapy reduces the risk for ASCVD events by 25 percent to 45 percent (Law, Wald, &amp; Rudnicka, 2003)</p>
<p><strong>Guideline recommendations</strong>: ACC/AHA. For men and women 21 to 75 years of age with a diagnosis of clinical ASCVD, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended. If high-intensity therapy is contraindicated, or when adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used (Stone et al., 2013).</p></div>
