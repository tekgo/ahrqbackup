Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of May 2014. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/fhp/practiceguides/newhtn.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the original guideline document for additional information.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although a single, carefully taken blood pressure (BP) reading may predict future cardiovascular risk, for clinical purposes this risk is better identified by taking the mean BP level from recordings over several visits. </li>
    <li>Home and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring helps improve BP control, and identifies "white coat" and "masked" hypertension <em>[IIA]</em>. </li>
    <li>If home BP monitoring is used, careful calibration of the BP monitor and thorough patient education are essential. </li>
    <li>Individuals with mean BP &gt;135/80 should be screened for diabetes <em>[IB]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>For patients without diabetes or end organ damage, target of BP for
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Age &lt;60 years is &lt;140/90 mm Hg <em>[IA]</em> </li>
        <li>Age &ge;60 years is &lt;150/90 mm Hg <em>[IB]</em> </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For patients with diabetes or end organ damage (e.g., renal insufficiency, retinopathy, congestive heart failure [CHF], coronary artery disease [CAD], pulmonary veno-occlusive disease [PVOD], cerebrovascular disease), appropriate treatment of hypertension provides significant improvements in clinical outcomes <em>[IA]</em>. Recommended BP targets are systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &lt;140 mm Hg (<em>[IB]</em> for CHF and CAD; <em>[ID]</em> for diabetes and other end organ damage), and diastolic BP goal of &lt;90 mm Hg <em>[IB]</em>. </li>
    <li>Treatment of SBP over 160 mm Hg is important in reducing cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and CHF risk <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
    <li>Lifestyle modifications to lower BP are important adjuncts to drug therapy <em>[IA]</em>. </li>
    <li>Begin therapy with a thiazide diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP CCB) for almost all patients. Add second and third agents as needed to achieve effective BP reduction goals <em>[IA]</em>.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Specific illnesses may guide the initial and subsequent choice of agents, e.g.:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>ACE inhibitors (angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB] for those unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors) for patients with renal disease, diabetes with either micro- or macroalbuminuria, or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction </li>
            <li>&beta;-blockers for those with CAD or CHF </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Over 70% of individuals require two or more drugs to achieve BP goals. A fixed combination therapy may be cost-effective. Once a day medications increase compliance and are preferred. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Preliminary evidence was identified using literature considered relevant in Joint National Committee (JNC) 7 (see annotated references in the original guideline document). That report utilized literature searches of the preceding reports and added a systematic search of literature from January 1997 through April 2003.</p>
<p>In 2007 a search of literature from 2003 to 2007 was performed that was also utilized to develop the 2009 version of this guideline. That search was conducted on MEDLINE prospectively using the major keywords of: <em>hypertension, human adults, English language, clinical trials, guidelines</em>, and <em>published from 1/1/03 through 5/1/07</em>. Terms used for specific topic searches within the major key words included: <em>alpha 1 blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonist, beta blockers (selective and non-selective), calcium channel blockers (dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine forms), centrally acting alpha-2 agonist, diuretics (thiazide and non-thiazide, loop, potassium-sparing), vasodilator (direct), avoidance (alcohol, stress, tobacco), blood pressure monitoring (ambulatory, home), dietary (caffeine, calcium, garlic, magnesium, onion, potassium, sodium), exercise, disease-based management (stroke, coronary artery disease, cardiac, heart failure, arterial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome), and resistant hypertension</em>. Detailed search terms and strategy available upon request.</p>
<p>In 2013 the full literature search was deferred while waiting for the search results of JNC 2013 ("JNC 8"). However, expert member of the team identified three topics for which important new evidence had been published and systematic searches were performed on those topics. The search was conducted on Medline prospectively using the major keywords of: <em>hypertension, human adults, English language, guidelines, clinical trials, cohort studies</em>, and <em>published from 1/1/03 through 6/1/13</em>. Terms used for specific topic searches within the major key words included: <em>combination of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and ARB (angiotensin receptor blockers), combination of ARB and DRI (direct renin inhibitors), and patients age &ge; 65 years (older/elderly) and target blood pressure and treatment</em>.</p>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with very recent information available to expert members of the panel, including abstracts from recent meetings and results of clinical trials. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p></div>

Potential Harms

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Thiazide diuretics increase the frequency of sexual dysfunction in men and women and initially may cause interruptions in daily routine for micturition. Thiazides cause a short-term increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; however, long-term trials have shown minimal change and outcome studies show no clinical impact. Thiazides slightly increase risk for diabetes. While small changes in LDL and glycemic control are not contraindications, the clinical impact of these metabolic aberrations has yet to be elucidated. Thiazides can increase uric acid and precipitate attacks of gout. Hypokalemia is uncommon at usual (12.5 mg to 25 mg) doses but occurs relatively often at doses of 50 mg or more. </li>
    <li>Angioedema is a rare side effect (0.1% to 0.7%) of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which may be life-threatening and may occur at any point in the treatment. The incidence may be higher in African Americans. Although renal artery stenosis per se is not a contraindication for ACE therapy, renal impairment may occur in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis with a single kidney. All in this class induce cough equally, which may be disabling enough with some patients to result in the need to discontinue the drug; cough occurs more often in women. </li>
    <li>Angioedema has been rarely reported with Losartan, but has occurred in patients with prior angioedema on ACE inhibitors. Losartan has a uricosuric effect (i.e., increases excretion of uric acid, lowering concentration in blood) that is unique compared to others in this class. Losartan may be less efficacious compared to others in this group at lowering blood pressure (BP) and should be used twice a day. </li>
    <li>Edema may occur with calcium channel blocking agents and is more pronounced with the dihydropyridine agents. Bradycardia is a side effect of verapamil and diltiazem, but renders them useful agents in the treatment of atrial fibrillation/SVT). Verapamil has more pronounced bradycardia effects and often results in constipation. Verapamil and diltiazem may increase risk for statin myopathy (cytochrome 3A4 inhibition). </li>
    <li>Occasionally fatigue and uncommonly impotence are side effects of &beta; blockers at the recommended low doses. &beta;-1 blockers produce the same dramatic reduction in angiotensin II levels as ACE inhibitors, and the two agents together have an additive effect. Though &beta; blockers may raise triglycerides and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, these effects have not been found to be clinically significant in outcome studies. </li>

    <li>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are contraindicated in pregnancy. </li>
    <li>ACE inhibitors and ARBs are relatively contraindicated in patients with bilateral or equivalent renal artery stenosis. </li>
    <li>Short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP CCBs) are relatively contraindicated for all coronary artery disease. </li>
    <li>Non-DHP CCBs and alpha blockers are relatively contraindicated in congestive heart failure (CHF) -- systolic. </li>
    <li>Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs are relatively contraindicated in patients taking lithium. </li>
    <li>DHP CCB alone is relatively contraindicated in patients with chronic renal disease. </li>
