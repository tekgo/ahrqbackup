<p><strong>Interpretation of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<p>Table 1 below summarizes the assignment of the likely thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) phenotype on the basis of the most common * allele diplotypes, and these assignments are used to link genotypes with thiopurine dosing. Although inactivating <em>TPMT</em> alleles have been extensively studied in several populations (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 in the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), one of the limitations inherent in a commercial genotype-only test is that rare or previously undiscovered variants will generally not be detected.</p>

<p><strong>Dosage Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Thiopurines are most commonly used to treat nonmalignant conditions but are also critical anticancer agents. The approach to dosing adjustments based on TPMT status may differ depending on the clinical indication and the propensity to initiate therapy at higher vs. lower starting doses. The guideline authors and others advocate testing for TPMT status prior to initiating thiopurine therapy, so that starting dosages can be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Thiopurines are used as immunosuppressants in inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other immune conditions. In most of these diseases, the selection of medications is carried out stepwise, with multiple nonthiopurine (and nonmyelosuppressive) agents being available as alternatives. Several consensus guidelines for treatment of nonmalignant diseases explicitly recommend preemptive TPMT testing coupled with customized starting doses of thiopurines. A survey calling for responses from pediatric gastroenterologists revealed that 61% of child patients were tested for TPMT before starting thiopurine therapy, and the average rates of preemptive testing reported by non-cancer specialists in the United Kingdom were 47%&ndash;94%.</p>
<p>In nonmalignant conditions, if one starts with low doses in all patients in order to avoid severe toxicity in the minority with a <em>TPMT</em> defect, one risks disease progression during the period of upward dosage titration. In nonmalignant conditions, full starting doses are recommended for homozygous wild-type carriers, reduced doses (30%&ndash;70% of target dose) in those who are heterozygous for <em>TPMT</em>, and substantially reduced doses (or use of an alternative agent) in the rare homozygous deficient patients (see Table 2 below).</p>
<p>Thiopurines have a unique role in the treatment of several malignancies. Conventional starting doses of thiopurines are generally "high" because these doses have been derived from trials heavily weighted by the ~86%&ndash;97% of the population who are wild-type for <em>TPMT</em> and receive maximal tolerable doses by the standards of anticancer treatment (hence, full doses should be given to those who are homozygous wild-type for <em>TPMT</em>; see table below). Given that starting doses have tended to be high (e.g., 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of mercaptopurine [MP]) in cancer (e.g., in acute lymphoblastic leukemia), lower-than-normal starting doses should be used in heterozygous deficient patients and markedly reduced doses (at least 10-fold reduction) in homozygous deficient patients (see Table 2, below). This approach has decreased the risk of acute toxicity without compromising relapse rates in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Even at these markedly reduced dosages, erythrocyte thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) concentrations in homozygous deficient patients remain well above those tolerated and achieved by the majority of patients (who are wild-type for <em>TPMT</em>).</p>
<p>There are varying practices about when&mdash;and even whether&mdash;to test for TPMT status in oncology patients who receive thiopurines. Because of the rarity of malignancies and defective <em>TPMT</em> genotypes, no randomized clinical trials have proven the benefit of customizing starting doses of thiopurine based on TPMT status in cancer settings. Nevertheless, many cancer clinicians preemptively test TPMT status to customize starting doses of thiopurines, basing their decision on the strong mechanistic data and retrospective analyses of clinical trials supporting a lower dose in those with a TPMT defect (see Supplementary Table S5 online and in the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Thiopurines are almost always used as part of combination chemotherapy that contains multiple myelosuppressive medications. Therefore, a trial-and-error approach (i.e., starting thiopurine therapy without ascertaining the TPMT status) has some disadvantages. The duration of myelosuppression varies substantially&mdash;an extremely long period of myelosuppression can result if conventional thiopurine doses are given to a patient with low TPMT activity, thereby delaying ongoing chemotherapy. Also, it is impossible to determine, through clinical monitoring alone, which of several myelosuppressive agents is the most likely cause of myelosuppression. Another reason to test every patient preemptively is that even a short full-dose course of thiopurines can result in death or severe myelosuppression in the rare homozygous deficient individual. Such an eventuality could be avoided by preemptive testing and starting with dramatically decreased doses (more than 10-fold lower than normal doses) of thiopurine or choosing an alternative therapy for the potentially at-risk patients.</p>
<p>Some of the clinical data on which dosing recommendations are based (see Table 2 below) rely on measures of TPMT phenotype rather than genotype; however, because <em>TPMT</em> genotype is so strongly linked to TPMT phenotype, these recommendations should apply regardless of the method used to assess TPMT status.</p>

<p>To construct a <em>TPMT</em> minor allele frequency table (see Supplemental Table S3 in the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) based on ethnicity, the following search criteria were used: (TPMT) OR (thiopurine) AND ((allele) OR (frequency) OR (genotype)). Studies were considered for inclusion if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or minor allele percentages for <em>TPMT</em> genotypes were reported, (3) the method by which <em>TPMT</em> was genotyped was reliable and proven (no proof-of-principle experiments), (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 patients, and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews). The combined analysis included 8,676 Caucasians, 2,938 Mediterraneans, 1,028 South Americans, 1,146 Africans, 8,377 Asians, 600 South West Asians, 507 Mexicans, and 2,403 Middle Easterners.

<div class="content_para"><p>The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium's dosing recommendations are based on weighting the evidence from a combination of preclinical functional and clinical data (see Table S5 in the online Supplemental material; see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), as well as on some existing disease-specific consensus guidelines. Some of the factors that are taken into account in evaluating the evidence supporting dosage recommendations include: <em>in vivo</em> clinical outcome data for thiopurines, <em>in vivo</em> pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for thiopurines, <em>in vitro</em> enzyme activity of expressed wild-type or variant-containing thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) (with thiopurines as substrate), <em>in vitro</em> TPMT enzyme activity from tissues isolated from individuals of known <em>TPMT</em> genotypes, <em>in vivo</em> pre-clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, and <em>in vitro</em> studies of TPMT protein stability or enzyme activity.</p>

Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The guideline authors have focused on presenting evidence from well-done studies and it is the interpretation of the results from these studies that provide the framework for the strength of the dosing recommendations (see the "Major Recommendations" field).</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>One of the benefits of preemptive thiopurine methyltransferase (<em>TPMT</em>) testing is that doses that are customized on the basis of TPMT status reduce the likelihood of acute myelosuppression without compromising disease control.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The risks of thiopurine methyltransferase (<em>TPMT</em>) testing would be that a proportion of heterozygotes may spend a period of time at lower thiopurine doses than they can eventually tolerate, because only ~30%&ndash;60% of heterozygous patients receiving conventional thiopurine doses experience severe myelosuppression. However, because steady state is reached in 2&ndash;4 weeks, any period of "underdosing" should be short, and in studies using this approach&mdash;at least in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease&mdash;outcomes were not compromised. </li>
    <li>A possible risk to the patient is an error in genotyping. Because genotypes are lifelong test results, any such error could stay in the medical record for the life of the patient. </li>
    <li>Some serious long-term adverse effects (secondary tumors) have been associated with the use of thiopurine therapy in patients with defective TPMT activity, even in the absence of severe acute myelosuppression; it is not known whether capping doses of thiopurines in those with a TPMT defect will ameliorate the risk of these late-developing adverse effects (secondary cancer). Some adverse reactions to thiopurines, such as pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, are not related to low TPMT activity. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<p>Usually, thiopurines are administered orally every day for a period of at least several months. Genotype-based starting doses are just that&mdash;starting doses&mdash;and in most diseases, titration to an acceptable degree of myelosuppression is required. Clinicians should continue to evaluate markers of disease progression and/or myelosuppression to adjust thiopurine doses upward or downward from the genotype-directed starting doses. One caveat is that some serious long-term adverse effects (secondary tumors) have been associated with the use of thiopurine therapy in patients with defective thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity, even in the absence of severe acute myelosuppression; it is not known whether capping doses of thiopurines in those with a TPMT defect will ameliorate the risk of these late-developing adverse effects (secondary cancer). Some adverse reactions to thiopurines, such as pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, are not related to low TPMT activity.</p>

<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision making, as well as to identify questions and settings for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication, which may or may not affect that guideline. The healthcare provider is responsible to check for updates to guidelines or subsequently published data. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the complete responsibility of the healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be solely made by the clinician and the informed and consenting patient.
