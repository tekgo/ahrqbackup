<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients, regardless of age, with a diagnosis of clinically localized prostate cancer receiving interstitial prostate brachytherapy, OR external beam radiotherapy to the prostate, OR radical prostatectomy, OR cryotherapy who received counseling on, at a minimum, the following treatment options for clinically localized disease prior to initiation of treatment: active surveillance, AND interstitial prostate brachytherapy, AND external beam radiotherapy, AND radical prostatectomy.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>To enable each prostate cancer patient with clinically localized disease to make an informed choice among options for primary therapy, he should receive counseling on at least the four interventions listed in this measure. Additional treatment options may be offered, but fewer data are available to support their effectiveness.*</p>
<p class="Note">*The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:</p>
<p class="Note">A patient with clinically localized prostate cancer should be informed about the commonly accepted initial interventions including, at a minimum, active surveillance, radiotherapy (external beam and interstitial), and radical prostatectomy. A discussion of the estimates for benefits and harms of each intervention should be offered to the patient (Thompson et al., 2007).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) in collaboration with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and American Urological Association (AUA) conducted a testing project to ensure that the prostate cancer measures were feasible to implement, valid and reliable. Overall, the measures were found to be valid and reliable.</p>
<p><em>Face Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Face validity of the measure score was assessed for three of the six prostate cancer measures. The Prostate Cancer Work Group members were asked to empirically assess face validity of the measure. The expert panel consisted of 19 members, whose specialties include urology, methodology, clinical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, family medicine, and consumer and health plan representatives.</p>
<p>After the measure was fully specified, the work group was asked to rate their agreement with the following statement: "The scores obtained from the measure, as specified, will provide an accurate reflection of quality and can be used to distinguish good and poor quality."</p>

<p><em>Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>Inter-rater reliability testing (i.e., manual review of the patient medical record by two trained clinical abstractors and comparison of their individual findings) was conducted at five practice sites on all six of the prostate cancer measures. These sites represent various types, locations, and sizes. Agreement rates were calculated at the measure level for the denominator, numerator and exceptions categories. Measure agreement was established based on the results of this analysis.</p>
<p><em>Reliability Testing Results</em></p>
<p>The PCPI measure testing project revealed that all six of the measures demonstrated almost perfect agreement in the numerator category.</p></div>
