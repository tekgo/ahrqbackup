Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the number of dental providers who have provided any dental procedures to at least one child, per 1,000 eligible children.</p>
<p>This rate will be expressed in terms of 1,000 eligible children (number of dental providers/1,000 enrolled children), where the eligible population includes children younger than 18 years of age at the end of the measurement year, who have been enrolled in a Medicaid program or health plan that includes dental care for at least one 90-day period (or 3 consecutive months) within the measurement year. Dental providers are identified by specific taxonomy codes and dental procedures by procedure codes.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Oral health is an important, but often understated, component of an individual's overall health, for children as well as adults. In the United States, data for 2005 to 2008 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicated that 20.4% of children aged 5 to 11 and 13.3% of children aged 12 to 19 years old had untreated dental caries (tooth decay or cavities). Furthermore, 38.7% of children aged 5 to 11 and 52.0% of children aged 12 to 19 had undergone dental restoration of some type(Dye, Li, &amp; Beltran-Aguilar, 2012).</p>
<p>If left untreated, dental disease can cause major problems, including significant pain, school absences, infections, and even death (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2011). In a 2000 report, the Surgeon General estimated the effect on missed school time to be quite significant, at 51 million school hours lost to dental disease (CMS, 2009).</p>
<p>Recommended schedules for both starting and maintaining regular dental visits vary, but the general recommendation is to begin visits around 1 to 2 years of age (or at first tooth eruption). For example, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends beginning by age 1 at the latest, with services including "at a minimum, relief of pain and infections, restoration of teeth, and maintenance of dental health" (CMS, 2009). Despite these recommendations, many children fail to get annual dental services of any kind. An estimate from 2004 data suggests that less than half of children (49.6%) visited a dentist in the previous year; this is a slight improvement from 1997, when it was 45.7% (Wall &amp; Brown, 2008). More recent evidence suggests that rates of dental visits have not improved. A recent update to the Healthy People 2020 goals notes that "the indicator for dental visits is losing ground," though this indicator includes people of all ages over 2 (Koh, Blakey, &amp; Roper, 2014). </p>
<p>Many factors can contribute to a child's failure to obtain a dental visit in a given year, including general availability of dental providers and the availability of providers who will accept the child's payment source. A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2010) report highlights the geographic disparities in access to dental providers: 4,377 areas in the United States have a shortage of dental health professionals; 7,008 dentists would be needed to fill the gap. Moreover, the reluctance of many dentists to accept Medicaid-enrolled children has been demonstrated in numerous studies (Damiano et al., 1990; Eklund, Pittman, &amp; Clark, 2003; Iben, Kanellis, &amp; Warren, 2000; Mayer et al., 2000; Milgrom &amp; Riedy, 1998; Nainar &amp; Tinanoff, 1997; Shulman et al., 2001; Venzie &amp; Vann, 1993). Reasons cited include low reimbursement rates, excessive paperwork, late or frequently denied reimbursement, and high rates of missed appointments. As a result, the availability of dental providers for Medicaid-enrolled children is widely viewed as inadequate. This is borne out by data indicating that children on Medicaid are less likely to have had a dental visit in the previous year compared with children with private insurance (GAO, 2008). Similarly, children with special health care needs&mdash;many of whom are enrolled in Medicaid&mdash;are less likely to see a dentist compared with children without any special health care needs (Kane et al., 2008). </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC) used two methods to test the <em>reliability</em> of the measure. Replication of the measure calculation process demonstrated excellent reliability, with minor variance due to the dynamic nature of health administrative data. Comparison of the taxonomy-based provider identification data sources showed excellent reliability, with over 99% of dental providers identified through the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) registry, to which all Medicaid programs have access. <em>Validity</em> testing was performed to assess the impact of excluding organizational National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) from the measure calculation. Given the documented evidence that including the organizational NPIs would result in double-counting of a substantial number of dental providers, the overall validity of the measure is very good regarding the effect of excluding organizational NPIs.</p>
