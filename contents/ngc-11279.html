Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Panels of advanced practice nurses, staff nurses, and doctorally-prepared nurse researchers reviewed the literature base in the identified outcome areas. Professional health services librarians assisted in the conduct of the literature searches. Based on their analysis, the panels then formulated a judgment about the body of evidence related to the intervention under consideration. Three major components were considered by the panels in classifying the collective evidence into one of six Weight of Evidence categories (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field): </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality of the data, with more weight assigned to levels of evidence higher in the PRISM categorization (such as randomized trials and meta-analyses) </li>
    <li>Magnitude of the outcome (e.g., effect size or minimal clinically important difference) </li>
    <li>Concurrence among the evidence (based on the premise that an investigator has less confidence in findings in which the lines of evidence contradict one another) </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) information resources supervisor thoroughly searched the literature according to the strategy and search terms shown in the "Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence" field. Studies that met inclusion criteria were assigned to pairs of pain Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) team members, who reviewed and summarized included articles using a standard form. Each article was reviewed by one pain PEP team member and then peer-reviewed by the second pain PEP team member. The form included information about the purpose of the study and a brief description of the intervention, sample size and characteristics, study design, measurement instruments, conclusions, limitations that show risk of bias and threats to validity in design, and implications for nursing practice. </p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) program is a multifaceted project that involves the coordination of Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) staff as well as volunteer team contributors. PEP topic teams are comprised of volunteer nurse researchers, advanced practice nurses, and staff nurses who have demonstrated experience and interest in a PEP topic. Topic leaders are nurse scientists or advanced practice nurses with demonstrated expertise in the topic through research and/or publications.</p>
<p>PEP team members applied the ONS PEP classification scheme (see the "Rating Scheme for the Recommendations" field) to individual interventions via Web-based meetings occurring about every six months. PEP team members included nurse scientists, advanced practice nurses, and staff nurses. Classification considers all previous as well as new evidence for each intervention. Conferences are facilitated by ONS research staff and classification of individual interventions is determined by team consensus.</p>
<p>Teams categorize interventions based on the ONS PEP weight-of-evidence classification schema. The schema is intended to be used with existing research-based knowledge on health interventions and is based on previous research. PEP teams consider the entire body of evidence rather than a single study for classification, and more weight is given to studies that rank higher in ONS's priority symptom management project categorization. Team members also consider the magnitude of the outcome and the concurrence of the evidence for an intervention prior to assigning a classification. Interventions are classified by team consensus after application of the schema.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Buprenorphine may be useful in patients with opioid use disorders and in those with neuropathic pain syndromes. </li>
    <li>Oxycodone and naloxone can be combined to decrease the risk of constipation in patients taking opioids. Two observational studies, four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and one systematic review of 18 studies reported comparable or better pain control with the oxycodone and naloxone combination. A reduction in laxative use and improved bowel function were also noted. </li>
    <li>Two descriptive studies with about 300 patients noted a decrease in pain intensity and improved quality of life when controlled-release oxycodone was employed early. </li>
    <li>One double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT reported that abiraterone in combination with prednisone (Deltasone&reg;, Rayos&reg;, Sterapred&reg;, Prednicot&reg;) resulted in a longer reduction of pain and longer time to skeletal-related events </li>
    <li>Studies show less constipation in patients using transdermal (TD) fentanyl. </li>
    <li>An open-label study found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oral spray improved pain severity, sleep, and fatigue. </li>
    <li>Four observational trials found significant reductions in pain intensity with intraspinal analgesia. One prospective trial with long-term follow-up found that patients had a significant reduction in pain intensity at hospital discharge and for as long as six months, as well as a reduction in systematic opioid intake. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Only experienced clinicians should prescribe methadone because of its long half-life and potential for oversedation. Codeine is widely available worldwide, and evidence supports its use for cancer pain compared to placebo, but nausea, vomiting, and constipation are common side effects. Clinicians should also be aware that about 10% of the population is unable to metabolize codeine in its active form, resulting in ineffective analgesia. </li>
    <li>Administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be balanced with risks of toxicity, including renal, gastrointestinal, or cardiac toxicities, as well as thrombocytopenia and bleeding disorders. </li>
    <li>In studies of radiopharmaceuticals, acute pain flare was the primary toxicity, but bone marrow suppression also occurred. </li>
    <li>In some trials, tramadol was associated with more nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. </li>
    <li>Significant side effects associated with ketamine include hallucinations, somnolence or drowsiness, feelings of insobriety, nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, and depersonalization or derealization. </li>
</ul>
