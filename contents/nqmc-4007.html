Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of current alcohol dependence who were counseled regarding psychosocial AND pharmacologic treatment options for alcohol dependence within the 12 month reporting period.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Research has shown that among patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence, only 4.64&#37; were referred for psychosocial treatment in the form of substance abuse counseling, inpatient rehabilitation programs, outpatient rehabilitation programs, or mutual help groups. While pharmacologic therapy has established efficacy, often in combination with psychosocial therapy, in promoting abstinence and preventing relapse in alcohol-dependent patients, physician rates of prescribing pharmacologic therapy for alcohol dependence are also considerably low. A recent study found that these low rates prevail even among addiction medicine physicians who prescribed naltrexone to only 13&#37; of their alcohol dependent patients. Pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment should be routinely considered for all patients with alcohol dependence, and patients should be informed of this option.</p>

<p class="Note">The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <u>verbatim</u> from the referenced clinical guidelines (from the American Psychiatric Association [APA]) and represent the evidence base for the measure:</p>

<p class="Note">Psychosocial treatments found effective for some patients with an alcohol use disorder include motivational enhancement therapy (MET), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), behavioral therapies, 12-step facilitation (TSF), marital and family therapies, group therapies, and psychodynamic therapy/interpersonal therapy (IPT). (APA, 2006)</p>

<p class="Note">Specific pharmacotherapies for alcohol-dependent patients have well-established efficacy and moderate effectiveness:</p>

<ul class="contentListFont">
<li>Naltrexone may attenuate some of the reinforcing effects of alcohol, although data on its long-term efficacy are limited. The use of long-acting, injectable naltrexone may promote adherence, but published research is limited and FDA approval is pending. [Note: Extended-release naltrexone for injection has since received FDA approval]</li>
<li>Acamprosate, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analog that may decrease alcohol craving in abstinent individuals, may also be an effective adjunctive medication in motivated patients who are concomitantly receiving psychosocial treatment.</li>
<li>Disulfiram is an effective adjunct to a comprehensive treatment program for reliable, motivated patients whose drinking may be triggered by events that suddenly increase alcohol craving. (APA, 2006)</li>
</ul>

<p class="Note">Empirically validated psychosocial treatment interventions should be initiated for all patients with substance use illnesses. Pharmacotherapy should be offered and available to all adult patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence and without medical contraindications. Pharmacotherapy, if prescribed, should be provided in addition to and directly linked with psychosocial treatment/support. (National Quality Forum [NQF], 2007)</p></div>
