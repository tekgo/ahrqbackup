Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Sources and Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>A Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodologist, with input from the technical review authors and a medical librarian, developed and conducted several serial literature searches. The following bibliographic databases were searched through the OVID interface: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on November 18, 2013. The main search strategy consisted of controlled vocabulary, including the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) that were exploded, as well as free text words. The main terms included and combined were terms related to "biopsy," "histology," "microscopy," "immunohistochemistry," or "staining" combined with terms related to "dyspepsia." The exact synthesis of the main search strategy is provided in Appendix 1 of the technical review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The results were limited to English language and humans. The technical review authors applied filters to exclude conference abstracts, editorials, letters to the editor, and case reports. No limitations were applied on the year of publication. The criterion for selecting studies was compatibility with the patient population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) frame as defined in the technical review. Each title and abstract of the references identified by the search was independently checked by at least 2 authors, who removed obviously irrelevant reports. The full text of all potentially relevant studies was obtained and assessed for relevance to this project, again by at least 2 authors. The final decisions on inclusion were based on consensus. The technical review authors included primary studies and systematic reviews. In selecting studies, they followed the umbrella systematic review approach in which they identified published systematic reviews that fit predetermined eligibility criteria and ranked articles based on publication type and methodological rigor.</p>
<p>A systematic review was eligible for inclusion if it evaluated the outcomes of interest mentioned (i.e., outcomes important to patients). The technical review authors supplemented this by trying to identify any additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) not included in the systematic reviews, as well as references of relevant articles from the systematic reviews. When the systematic reviews did not provide sufficient information to fully apply the GRADE approach (such as rigorous assessment of risk of bias, assessment of heterogeneity, and adequate description of studies to judge directness), they attempted to retrieve and assess the individual primary studies. When systematic reviews were not up to date or were incomplete, the technical review authors performed additional focused literature searches in MEDLINE and attempted to perform their own systematic reviews and meta-analyses using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan (Review Manager, 2014, version 5.3, The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark).</p></div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluating the Evidence: Risk of Bias and Study Quality Appraisal</span></strong></p>
<p>Within the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) start as high-quality evidence but can be rated down for 5 possible reasons. Using GRADE, the quality of evidence for each outcome was evaluated for the following domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. When the systematic reviews did not provide sufficient information to judge the quality of the evidence, individual studies were retrieved. Evidence ratings and qualitative judgments were determined via video conference discussion and consensus. For each question, an overall judgment of quality of evidence was made for a body of evidence that encompassed all critical outcomes.</p>
<p>When available, quantitative estimates of effect were applied from existing systematic reviews. Quality of evidence was presented in the form of answers to the 2 major questions for each anatomic region as discussed. Answers to the question are organized around major conditions of interest for each organ.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The guideline was developed by the American Gastroenterological Association's (AGA) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee and approved by the AGA Governing Board.</p>
<p>This guideline was developed utilizing the AGA Process for Developing Guidelines (see the "Availability of Companion Documents"). Briefly, the AGA process for developing clinical practice guidelines incorporates the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and best practices for generating trustworthy guidelines as outlined by the Institute of Medicine. GRADE methodology was utilized to prepare the background information for the guideline and the technical review that accompanies it. Optimal understanding of this guideline will be enhanced by reading applicable portions of the technical review, authored by a multidisciplinary panel that included a gastrointestinal pathologist. In preparation for the formulation of the current guideline recommendations, the guideline panel and the authors of the technical review met face to face in January 2015 to systematically review the quality, quantity, and consistency of the available aggregate evidence and consider other factors relevant for the risk-to-benefit assessment of the eventual recommendations. Although critically important, it must be underscored that evidence quality was not the only factor considered in the formulation of the recommendations. Other considerations, wherever appropriate, included comparison of the benefits and harms of particular recommendation, economic value, and potential variations in patient preference. In addition, these guidelines are developed based primarily on evidence derived from Western populations. Certain non-Western populations might have sufficiently high risk for upper gastrointestinal abnormalities to warrant a risk-tailored management approach. Finally, the endoscopic biopsy itself was assumed to be associated with a negligible rate of complications.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Despite the overall low quality of the evidence, there are substantial data, including those from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), supporting a clinically important benefit to detecting and eradicating <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (HP) infection in patients with dyspepsia, both with respect to symptomatic relief and gastric cancer risk reduction. A strong recommendation for obtaining routine biopsies for the detection of HP in patients with dyspepsia was justified. Notably, in patients whose HP infection status is already known, this recommendation would not apply, as the assumed benefit would not be present. </li>
    <li>A strong recommendation against obtaining routine biopsy of normal-appearing esophagus and gastroesophageal (GE) junction was believed to be justified, despite the very-low-quality evidence. Nevertheless, in certain populations (e.g., Iranian and Chinese) at high risk for squamous dysplasia, which could be associated with subtle mucosal changes, risk-tailored management considerations might be warranted. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>One must consider the potential for false-positive biopsy diagnosis in celiac disease among patients with dyspepsia, particularly when only early-grade celiac changes (e.g., Marsh I-II) are detected. Because this recommendation is primarily dependent on very-low-quality prevalence data, a conditional recommendation is warranted. As the possibility exists that the true prevalence of celiac disease among patients presenting with dyspepsia might be higher than what the current literature suggests, the recommendation against obtaining routine biopsies of the normal-appearing duodenum to detect celiac disease might need to be updated when higher-quality evidence becomes available. Biopsy of the normal-appearing duodenum might be appropriate in patients who are at high risk for celiac disease, as specified by a previous American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline on the diagnosis and management of celiac disease.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>These standards are intended to reduce practice variation and promote high-value care. It is important to recognize that there are areas of scientific uncertainty due to low-quality evidence or absence of evidence associated with a number of the recommendations. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) would like to encourage future research to address these evidentiary limitations. Accordingly, the AGA will continue to monitor and assess new and potentially relevant evidence to determine whether updating of these recommendations is justified.</p></div>
