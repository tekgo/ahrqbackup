<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Structured Web Site Search</strong></p>
<p>A member of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team (project coordinator) searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines.</p>
<p>Guidelines were selected based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Focus on topic of transitions in care (terms include: care transitions, discharge planning, handovers, hospital to home and community and residential, group home, other transitional facilities such as mental health, rehabilitation, long-term care, transitions) which includes:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Assessment </li>
        <li>Management </li>
        <li>Client safety and transitions </li>
        <li>Education or training requirements for nurses </li>
        <li>Organizational and health-care system responsibilities or support for transitions </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Published no earlier than January 2002 </li>
    <li>Published in English, national and international in scope </li>
    <li>Accessible for retrieval </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for a list of Web sites searched, search term, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Search</strong></p>
<p>RNAO expert panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify and submit potentially relevant guidelines. Guidelines submitted for consideration by RNAO expert panel members were integrated into the retrieved list of guidelines if they had not been identified by the on-line guideline search and met the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Review</strong></p>
<p>Members of the expert panel critically appraised 12 international guidelines using the <em>Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II</em>. From this review, six guidelines were selected to inform the review process.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Systematic Review</strong></span></p>
<p>Concurrent with the review of existing guidelines, a search for recent literature relevant to the scope of the guideline was conducted with guidance from the chair of RNAO's expert panel. The systematic literature search was conducted by a health-sciences librarian. The search, limited to English-language articles published between January 2002 and August 2012, was applied to CINAHL, EMBASE, DARE, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ERIC, Joanna Briggs, and PsycINFO databases. The initial search for relevant studies pertaining to questions 1 and 2 returned 7937 articles. Due to the volume of research, the inclusion criteria for study methodology was changed and limited to meta-analysis, systematic reviews, integrative reviews, randomized controlled trials and qualitative evidence syntheses. Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms is available in the search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Two research associates (master's prepared nurses) independently assessed the eligibility of studies according to the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. RNAO's best practice guideline program manager working with the expert panel, resolved disagreements.</p></div>

<p>To determine interrater reliability, 10% of included studies from the relevance review were independently quality appraised by both research associates (RAs). A sufficient kappa score (&kappa;=0.71) was achieved, allowing the remaining studies to be divided equally between the 2 RAs for independent quality appraisal. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated as follows: the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool (<a href="http://amstar.ca/" title="AMSTAR Web site">http://amstar.ca/</a>) was used to appraise all systematic reviews and meta-analyses, whereas Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tools that were developed in the United Kingdom (<a href="http://www.casp-uk.net/find-appraise-act/" title="CASP Web site">http://www.casp-uk.net/find-appraise-act/</a>) were used to appraise case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, qualitative studies, and randomized controlled trials. Studies were rated as strong (&gt;85%), moderate (65% to 80%), or weak (&lt;60%), based on their rounded score. Studies were data extracted and organized into data tables by research question.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For this new guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled an expert panel of health-care professionals with particular expertise in this practice area. A systematic review of the evidence took into consideration the purpose and scope of the guideline and was supported by six clinical questions. It captured relevant literature and guidelines published between January 2002 and June 2012. These are the research questions that guided the systematic review:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What are the most effective assessment and management strategies to ensure continuity of care and safe optimal client outcomes during care transitions? </li>
    <li>What safety and monitoring strategies should be considered to ensure continuity of care and safe optimal client outcomes during care transitions? </li>
    <li>What educational supports do nurses and other health-care providers require to effectively assess and manage client care transitions? </li>
    <li>What organization characteristics support nurses and other health-care providers to effectively assess and manage client care transitions? </li>
</ol>
<p>This new guideline, <em>Care Transitions</em> is the result of the expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence and ensure the validity, appropriateness and safety of the guideline recommendations with supporting evidence.</p>
<p>The comprehensive data tables and summary were provided to all RNAO's expert panel members. In October 2012, the expert panel convened to develop and achieve consensus on guideline recommendations and discussion of evidence.</p></div>

    <li>These guidelines are not binding on nurses or the organizations that employ them. The use of these guidelines should be flexible, and based on individual needs and local circumstances. They neither constitute a liability nor discharge from liability. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the contents at the time of publication, neither the authors nor the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) give any guarantee as to the accuracy of the information contained in them nor accept any liability, with respect to loss, damage, injury or expense arising from any such errors or omission in the contents of this work. </li>
    <li>This nursing best practice guideline is a comprehensive document providing resources for evidence-based nursing practice and should be considered a tool, or template, intended to enhance decision making for individualized care. The guideline is intended to be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of the individual organizations or practice settings and the needs and wishes of the client (<em>throughout the guideline, the word "client" is used to refer to patients, persons, residents, or consumers; that is the client, their family and caregivers, or parents, or substitute decision makers being cared for by the interprofessional team</em>). In addition, the guideline provides an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care. </li>
    <li>Nurses, other health-care professionals and administrators who lead and facilitate practice changes will find this document invaluable for developing policies, procedures, protocols, educational programs and assessments, interventions and documentation tools. Nurses in direct care will benefit from reviewing the recommendations and the evidence that supports them. The RNAO particularly recommends practice settings adapt these guidelines in formats that are user-friendly for daily use. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multifaceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines (2nd ed.)</em> provides an evidence-informed process for doing that.</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health care is more likely when:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guideline is relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses the "Knowledge-to-Action" framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.</p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of their guidelines. RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including the Nursing Best Practice Champion Network<sup>&reg;</sup>, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement and adoption of Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs); and the Best Practice Spotlight Organization<sup>&reg;</sup> (BPSO<sup>&reg;</sup>) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate and sustain multiple RNAO best practice guidelines. In addition, RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific guidelines and their implementation annually.</p>
