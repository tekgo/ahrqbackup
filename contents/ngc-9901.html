Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the strength of evidence (Class I-IV) and strength of recommendations (Level A-U) are located at the end of the Major Recommendations Field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>It is axiomatic that clinicians managing antithrombotic medications periprocedurally weigh bleeding risks from drug continuation against thromboembolic (TE) risks from discontinuation at the individual patient level, although high-quality evidence on which to base this decision is often unavailable. In addition, even when evidence is insufficient to exclude a difference in bleeding or shows a small increase in clinically important bleeding with antithrombotic agents, physicians may reasonably judge that the risks and morbidity of TE events exceed those associated with bleeding. </li>
    <li>Neurologists should counsel both patients taking aspirin for secondary stroke prevention and their physicians that aspirin discontinuation is probably associated with increased stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) risk (<strong>Level B</strong>). Estimated stroke risks vary across studies and according to duration of aspirin discontinuation. </li>
    <li>Neurologists should counsel patients taking anticoagulation (AC) for stroke prevention that the TE risks associated with different AC periprocedural management strategies (continuing oral AC or stopping it with or without bridging heparin) are unknown (<strong>Level U</strong>) but that the risk of TE complications with warfarin discontinuation is probably higher if AC is stopped for &ge;7 days (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients taking aspirin should be counseled that aspirin continuation is highly unlikely to increase clinically important bleeding complications with dental procedures (<strong>Level A</strong>). Given minimal clinically important bleeding risks, it is reasonable that stroke patients undergoing dental procedures should routinely continue aspirin (<strong>Level A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients taking aspirin should be counseled that aspirin continuation probably does not increase clinically important bleeding complications with invasive ocular anesthesia, cataract surgery, dermatologic procedures, transrectal ultrasound&ndash;guided prostate biopsy, spinal/epidural procedures, and carpal tunnel surgery (<strong>Level B</strong>). Given minimal clinically important bleeding risks, it is reasonable that stroke patients undergoing these procedures should probably continue aspirin (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Aspirin continuation might not increase clinically important bleeding in vitreoretinal surgery, electromyogram (EMG), transbronchial lung biopsy, colonoscopic polypectomy, upper endoscopy with biopsy, sphincterotomy, and abdominal ultrasound&ndash;guided biopsies. Given the weaker data supporting minimal clinically important bleeding risks, it is reasonable that some stroke patients undergoing these procedures should possibly continue aspirin (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Although bleeding events were rare, studies of transurethral resection of the prostate lack the statistical precision to exclude clinically important bleeding risks with aspirin continuation (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients taking aspirin should be counseled that aspirin probably increases bleeding risks during orthopedic hip procedures (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Neurologists should counsel patients that there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations regarding appropriate periprocedural clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or aspirin/dipyridamole management in most situations (<strong>Level U</strong>). Aspirin recommendations cannot be extrapolated with certainty to other antiplatelet (AP) agents. </li>
    <li>Patients taking warfarin should be counseled that warfarin continuation is highly unlikely to be associated with increased clinically important bleeding complications with dental procedures (<strong>Level A</strong>). Given minimal bleeding risks, stroke patients undergoing dental procedures should routinely continue warfarin (<strong>Level A</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients taking warfarin should be counseled that warfarin continuation is probably associated with only a small (1.2%) increased risk difference for bleeding during dermatologic procedures on the basis of a meta-analysis of heterogeneous and conflicting studies (<strong>Level B</strong>). Thus, patients undergoing dermatologic procedures should probably continue warfarin (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients taking warfarin should be counseled that warfarin continuation is probably not associated with an increased risk of clinically important bleeding with ocular anesthesia (<strong>Level B</strong>). However, AC practices during ophthalmologic procedures may be driven by the postanesthesia procedure. Although bleeding events were rare, ophthalmologic studies (other than those regarding ocular anesthesia) lack the statistical precision to exclude clinically important bleeding risks with warfarin continuation. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to make practice recommendations regarding warfarin discontinuation in ophthalmologic procedures (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>
    <li>Warfarin might be associated with no increased clinically important bleeding with EMG, prostate procedures, inguinal herniorrhaphy, and endothermal ablation of the great saphenous vein. Thus, patients undergoing these procedures should possibly continue warfarin (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients taking warfarin should be counseled that warfarin continuation might increase bleeding with colonoscopic polypectomy (<strong>Level C</strong>). Thus, patients undergoing this procedure should possibly temporarily discontinue warfarin (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Neurologists should counsel patients that there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations regarding appropriate periprocedural management of nonwarfarin oral AC (<strong>Level U</strong>). Warfarin recommendations cannot be extrapolated with certainty to other AC agents. </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to determine differences in TE in chronically anticoagulated patients managed with heparin bridging therapy relative to oral AC discontinuation or continuation. Patients taking warfarin should be counseled that bridging therapy is probably associated with increased bleeding risks in procedures in general relative to AC cessation (<strong>Level B</strong>). Bridging probably does not reduce clinically important bleeding relative to continued AC with warfarin in dentistry, but bleeding risk differences between patients managed with continued warfarin vs bridging therapy in other procedures are unknown. Given that the benefits of bridging therapy are not established and that bridging is probably associated with increased bleeding risks, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute bridging therapy use in general (<strong>Level U</strong>). </li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: A cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for developing the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status). The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study of a broad spectrum of persons at risk for the outcome (e.g., target disease, work status) where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who is masked to the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: A case control study or a cohort study where either the persons with the condition or the controls are of a narrow spectrum where the data was collected retrospectively. The outcome is defined by an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The outcome is objective or measured by an observer who did not determine the presence of the risk factor. Study results allow calculation of measures of a prognostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong>: Studies not meeting Class I, II, or III criteria, including consensus, expert opinion, or a case report.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt; 5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt; 2).</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Literature searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE through August 2011 were performed in all languages using relevant MeSH terms, text word synonyms, and key words (for search strategy, see appendices e-3 and e-4 in the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The searches identified 5,904 citations yielding 133 relevant articles which at least two authors rated by using American Academy of Neurology (AAN) prognostic classification criteria (see appendix e-5 in the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Studies were downgraded one level for indirectness of evidence (e.g., comparing patients continuing antithrombotic agents with nonusers rather than with patients discontinuing medication). Bleeding and thromboembolic (TE) risks were analyzed by intervention type. Recommendations were linked to evidence strength (see appendix e-6 in the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p>Articles were included if they studied patients taking oral antithrombotic agents for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease or stroke prevention (including articles relating to atrial fibrillation), studied at least 20 subjects, included a comparison group, assessed risks of continuing or discontinuing an agent, and clearly described interventions and outcome measures. Both cardiac and stroke patients were included because risks overlap and many studies do not distinguish between the two groups. Case reports, review papers, and articles studying coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, pacemaker/defibrillator placement, and cerebrovascular procedures such as carotid endarterectomy were excluded because of confounding issues (e.g., procedure-related stroke) and because this guideline focuses on antithrombotic questions posed to treating neurologists. Non&ndash;English-language articles were included for which translations could be obtained.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2016 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>MEDLINE was searched from August 2011 to January 2016 using the search terms cerebrovascular accident OR cerebrovascular disorders AND Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors, antiplatelet, Aspirin, clopidogrel, Plavix, Ticlopidine, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal AND postoperative complications. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the search included RCTs, humans only, relevant to clinical questions; criteria used to screen search results were the same as described in the 2013 published guideline.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The panel considered clinically relevant outcomes (e.g., vascular events, reoperation, transfusion) rather than surrogate markers (e.g., hemoglobin level). Bleeding was classified according to GUSTO criteria (see figure e-1 in the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Moderate or severe bleeding was considered clinically important. Consideration was also given to clinically important specialty-specific outcomes, such as vision loss due to hemorrhage with ophthalmologic procedures or paralysis due to hemorrhage during spinal epidural procedures. Where possible, the risk difference (RD) &ndash; the arithmetic difference between the proportion of patients in one group experiencing the event relative to the proportion of patients in the other group &ndash; was calculated. The authors used 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the RDs (calculated using Wilson's method) as the measure of statistical precision.</p>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Guideline Development Subcommittee (see appendices e-1 and e-2 in the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) convened an expert panel to develop the guideline. Recommendations were made that were linked to the evidence (see appendix e-6 in the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>

<p>A Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation (GDDI) member who had expertise in stroke and vascular neurology conducted a targeted literature search for high quality studies using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. The GDDI reviewer and the subcommittee reviewed the new evidence and determined that the following three criteria were met: 1. There is no new evidence that would alter conclusions or recommendations in the guideline since the last literature search, 2. Guideline methodology is sound and current methodology is not substantially different, and 3. No significant practice variation relevant to the guideline currently exists.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Stopping antithrombotics increases the risk of thromboembolic (TE) events. The exact magnitude of this risk increase is unknown. To minimize this risk, it seems reasonable to minimize the duration of antithrombotic discontinuation. </li>
    <li>When considering the risks and benefits of antithrombotic discontinuation, it is important to consider both the frequency of undesirable outcomes and their long-term consequences. TE events occur infrequently, but the associated morbidity and mortality rates are high. In contrast, most reported bleeding outcomes are relatively mild. Decisions regarding periprocedural antithrombotic therapy depend on weighing these competing risks in the context of individual patient characteristics. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology&reg; peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at the <a href="http://www.aan.com/" title="AAN Web site">AAN Web site</a>.</p>
