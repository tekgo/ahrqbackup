<p>Approximately 1,900 disease-causing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (<em>CFTR</em>) variants have been identified (see Supplementary Table S1 online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) and have been extensively studied in multiple geographically, racially, and ethnically diverse cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Despite the large number of <em>CFTR</em> variants, most can be grouped into classes that have shared features (see Table 1 below).</p>

<p class="Note"><sup>a</sup>Other biosynthesis defects include frameshift mutations that would not be predicted to be influenced by stop codon suppression. <sup>b</sup>5T refers to the thymidine tract at the end of intron 8 (intron 9 when counting exons sequentially without subletters), which subsequently influences the splicing of exon 9 (exon 10) of CFTR. Described tract lengths include 5T, 7T, and 9T, with more efficient splicing exhibited with longer thymidine tracts. The thymidine tract status can be an important contributor to variant phenotype. For example, R117H <em>CFTR</em> with a 9T thymidine tract typically does not cause CF. By contrast, R117H <em>CFTR</em> with a 5T thymidine tract typically does cause CF, and R117H <em>CFTR</em> with a 7T thymidine tract is variably associated with CF. See Supplementary Table S1 online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for mapping details. <sup>c</sup>Evidence suggests that <em>F508del-CFTR</em> demonstrates reduced stability at the plasma membrane and rapid internalization following correction of folding and trafficking.</p>
<p class="Note">Adapted from Clancy, J.P. &amp; Jain, M. Personalized medicine in cystic fibrosis: dawning of a new era. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 186, 593&ndash;597 (2012).</p>
<p><strong>Genetic Test Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>Patients with CF may have undergone prenatal screening or a genetic test to determine the underlying variants of their condition, and results of these genetic tests can be used to guide therapy for ivacaftor treatment. The current guidelines focus on the interpretation of genetic tests for the presence of <em>G551D-CFTR, G1244E-CFTR, G1349D-CFTR, G178R-CFTR, G551S-CFTR, S1251N-CFTR, S1255P-CFTR, S549N-CFTR, S549R-CFTR</em>, and <em>F508del-CFTR</em> variants. For more information regarding screening for CF, see the Supplementary Material online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The wealth of information regarding how various mutations disrupt CFTR function is beginning to help clinicians to categorize CF patients for viable therapeutic strategies. <em>F508del-CFTR</em> (&Delta;-F508, p.F508del, c.1521_1523delCTT (rs113993960), and c.1520_1522delTCT (rs199826652)) is the most common <em>CFTR</em> variant (see Supplementary Tables S1, S2, and S3 online [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]. It is primarily a class II variant that is caused by the deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 in the CFTR protein (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2011 Patient Registry Report). The <em>F508del-CFTR</em> variant disrupts CFTR protein folding and processing, blocking maturation of the protein and localization to the plasma membrane. <em>G551D-CFTR</em> (p.G551D, c.1652G&gt;A, rs75527207 allele A) is the third most common <em>CFTR</em> variant and is present in 4.4% of CF patients. It is a single-nucleotide change that causes a glycine to aspartic acid amino acid change at position 551 of the CFTR protein, resulting in a class III (gating) variant capable of localizing to the epithelial cell surface but with defects in ATP binding and hydrolysis (by the nucleotide-binding domains) such that G551D-CFTR fails to transport chloride normally (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2011 Patient Registry Report).</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>After the submission and review of the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline manuscript, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug label for ivacaftor was updated to include additional variants. In light of these changes, the CPIC guideline annotation on PharmGKB (<a href="https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/guideline-for-ivacaftor-and-cftr/" title="CPIC Web site">https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/guideline-for-ivacaftor-and-cftr/</a>) has been updated to include additional <em>CFTR</em> variants, specifically G1244E (rs267606723), G1349D (rs193922525), G178R (rs80282562), G551S (rs121909013), S1251N (rs74503330), S1255P (rs121909041), S549N (rs121908755) and S549R (rs121908757 and rs121909005). These variants are not discussed in the 2014 guideline publication but are discussed in this summary.</p>
<p>The evidence outlined in Supplementary Table S4 online (see "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provides the basis of the therapeutic recommendations detailed in Table 2 (see below) and Figure 1 in the original guideline document (an updated version of Figure 1 including variants listed above is provided at <a href="https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/guideline-for-ivacaftor-and-cftr/" title="CPIC Web site">https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/guideline-for-ivacaftor-and-cftr/</a>). Ivacaftor treatment is recommended only in CF patients who are either homozygous or heterozygous for the <em>G551D-CFTR, G1244E-CFTR, G1349D-CFTR, G178R-CFTR, G551S-CFTR, S1251N-CFTR, S1255P-CFTR, S549N-CFTR, and S549R-CFTR</em> variants. This recommendation is based on the results of a small number of clinical trials that selected for patients with the <em>G551D-CFTR</em> variant and on recommendations by regulatory bodies. Furthermore, one study demonstrated a lack of clinical effect in patients with two copies of the <em>F508del-CFTR</em> variant; however, this study was underpowered to evaluate efficacy. This recommendation is also supported by the mechanism of action of ivacaftor, identified through drug screening as potentiating the gating function of mutant <em>CFTR</em>, and subsequent <em>in vitro</em> studies showing that ivacaftor enhances G551D-CFTR activity.</p>
<p>These recommendations are consistent with the FDA and European Medicines Agency labeling for ivacaftor (see <a href="http://www.pharmgkb.org/drug/PA165950341?tabType=tabDrugLabels" title="Pharmacogenomics Database Web site">http://www.pharmgkb.org/drug/PA165950341?tabType=tabDrugLabels</a>), in which the drug is indicated for use in CF patients who have a <em>G551D-CFTR</em> variant on at least one allele and is not recommended for those without a <em>G551D-CFTR</em> variant, including those homozygous for the <em>F508del-CFTR</em> variant. Both labels state that if genotype is unknown, accurate genetic testing of CFTR should be carried out before treatment with ivacaftor. In addition, the European Medicines Agency drug label states that the drug should be prescribed only by physicians who have experience in CF treatment.</p>
<p>Clinical trials of ivacaftor in patients with the <em>G551D-CFTR</em> variant were carried out in CF patients who were (i) 12 years and older and (ii) aged 6&ndash;11 years. The safety of the drug has not been established in children younger than 6 years of age; therefore, the recommendations in Table 2 (see below) are inclusive of pediatric patients aged 6 years and older, as well as in adults.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations for Incidental Findings</strong></p>
<p>The <em>G551D-CFTR</em> variant is associated with CF and pancreatic insufficiency (when a nonfunctional CFTR variant is found on the other allele) (<a href="http://www.CFTR2.org" title="Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR Web site">http://www.CFTR2.org</a>). Patients should discuss their genotype results with a CF physician and/or a genetic counselor. Furthermore, genetic counseling is important for families with children diagnosed with CF and also for families of children who are carriers for CF variants, so that they can understand their risks of CF in future pregnancies.</p>

<p class="Note"><sup>a</sup>These recommendations are based on treatment of CF patients with ivacaftor alone and on current evidence. Clinical trials are currently under way to investigate ivacaftor alone or in combination with other drugs to treat CF patients with CFTR variants other than G551D; therefore, there is potential that ivacaftor may be effective in these patients. See main text for further details. <sup>b</sup>The recommendation for patients with the F508del/F508del genotype is based on ivacaftor mechanism of action and clinical observational data. The clinical study, however, was a safety study and was not powered to detect a difference in efficacy. <sup>c</sup>Variants listed in this table include those added to the amended drug label for ivacaftor which was approved by the FDA on February 21, 2014.

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Potential Risks for Patients</strong></p>
<p>Patients with the aforementioned cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (<em>CFTR</em>) variants are still at risk of not responding to ivacaftor treatment, and treatment outcomes vary between patients. Unfortunately, CFTR biomarkers (sweat chloride levels and nasal potential difference) did not correlate with clinical response in the phase II and phase III trials of ivacaftor in <em>G551D-CFTR</em> patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, weight, risk of pulmonary exacerbations, or patient-reported outcomes). For patients without these <em>CFTR</em> variants, ivacaftor is not indicated. However, several drugs targeting other <em>CFTR</em> variants are currently under development or in clinical trials and may benefit these patients in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use AND/OR Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Errors may occur in <em>CFTR </em>genotyping or in the reporting of results. If so, a patient may be subjected to ineffective ivacaftor treatment or may be omitted from potentially effective treatment with ivacaftor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label states that an FDA&ndash;cleared test should be carried out if a patient's genotype is unknown. Genetic test results should include coverage for <em>G551D-CFTR</em> (rs75527207), <em>G1244E-CFTR</em> (rs267606723), <em>G1349D-CFTR</em> (rs193922525), <em>G178R-CFTR</em> (rs80282562), <em>G551S-CFTR</em> (rs121909013), <em>S1251N-CFTR</em> (rs74503330), <em>S1255P-CFTR</em> (rs121909041), <em>S549N-CFTR</em> (rs121908755) and <em>S549R-CFTR</em> (rs121908757 and rs121909005) in order to follow the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) ivacaftor guidelines. </li>
    <li>Other genetic and environmental factors may affect a patient's response to ivacaftor. Although traditionally considered a monogenic disease, cystic fibrosis (CF) has a complex phenotype. CFTR itself has many roles, defects in other genes may be involved, and many physiological pathways affect a CF patient's life span and response to therapy. Patients are still likely to require concomitant medications to treat the other accompanying disease manifestations and associated infections of CF. Drug&ndash;drug interactions may occur that affect ivacaftor efficacy and/or toxicity when taken in combination with other medications, in particular CYP3A inhibitors or inducers (<a href="http://www.pharmgkb.org/drug/PA165950341?tabType=tabDrugLabels" title="Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase">http://www.pharmgkb.org/drug/PA165950341?tabType=tabDrugLabels</a>), and conversely, ivacaftor may affect the efficacy and/or toxicity of concomitant therapies. </li>
