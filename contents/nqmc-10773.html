Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who filled at least two prescriptions for any long-acting inhaled bronchodilator on two unique dates of service who met the proportion of days covered (PDC) threshold of 80% during the measurement period.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Adherence to maintenance medications prescribed for COPD, such as long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, decreases exacerbations and hospitalizations and improves health outcomes.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Process for Development and Testing of Performance Measures</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) workgroups identify measure concepts that may be appropriate for development into fully specified performance measures. The workgroups focus on specific aspects of the medication-use system and/or specific therapeutic areas. The workgroups are open to all members of PQA and use a consensus-based approach to identify, prioritize and recommend the measure concepts that are deemed to be highly important for supporting quality improvement related to medications. </p>
<p>Step 2: The measure concepts that are recommended for further development through a vote by the PQA workgroups are forwarded to the PQA Quality Metrics Expert Panel (QMEP) for evaluation and refinement. The QMEP reviews the measure concepts to provide an initial assessment of the key properties of performance measures (i.e., feasibility, usability and scientific validity). The measure concepts that are rated highly on these key properties will then undergo technical specification. </p>
<p>Step 3: The draft measure is provided to PQA member organizations for their comments prior to preparing technical specifications for pilot testing. The QMEP reviews member comments, edits the draft measure accordingly and poses testing questions based on this all-member feedback. </p>
<p>Step 4: PQA selects partners to test the draft measure. These partners are often PQA member health plans or academic institutions with expertise in quality and performance measure testing. The testing partner implements the draft technical specifications with their existing datasets and provides a report to PQA that details testing results and recommendations for modifications of the technical specifications. </p>
<p>Step 5: The workgroup that developed the measure reviews the testing results and provides comment. The QMEP reviews the workgroup comments, testing results, recommendations and potential modifications and provides a final assessment of the feasibility and scientific validity of the draft performance measures.</p>
<p>Step 6: Measures that are recommended by the QMEP for endorsement are posted on the PQA Web site for member review, written comments are requested, and a conference call for member organizations is scheduled to address any questions. This process allows members to discuss their views on the measures in advance of the voting period. </p>
<p>Step 7: PQA member organizations vote on the performance measure(s) considered for endorsement.</p>
<p><strong>Adherence to Long-Acting Inhaled Bronchodilator Agents in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients</strong></p>
<p>Measure testing was done by two organizations using commercial and Medicare data to further define the measure specifications. Then two additional organizations tested the draft measure using Medicare data. Finally, two organizations provided additional testing analysis using commercial and Medicare data to determine whether COPD must be in the primary diagnosis field and whether hospitalization or Low Income Subsidy status impacted the measure.</p></div>
