Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of recommendation (<strong>1A&ndash;2C, consensus-based [CB]</strong>) and the approach to rating the quality of evidence are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years, the Expert Panel suggests defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of at least 4 weeks in duration (<strong>Ungraded, Consensus Based Statement</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests that an assessment of the effect of cough on the child and the family be undertaken as part of the clinical consultation (<strong>Ungraded, Consensus Based Statement</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends taking a systematic approach (such as using a validated guideline) to determine the cause of the cough (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history, such as using specific cough pointers like presence of productive/wet cough (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends basing the management on the etiology of the cough. An empirical approach aimed at treating upper airway cough syndrome due to a rhinosinus condition, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and/or asthma should not be used unless other features consistent with these conditions are present (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests that if an empirical trial is used based on features consistent with a hypothesized diagnosis, the trial should be of a defined limited duration in order to confirm or refute the hypothesized diagnosis (<strong>Ungraded, Consensus Based Statement</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre- and post-&beta;<sub>2</sub> agonist) be undertaken (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic cough, the Expert Panel suggests undertaking tests evaluating recent <em>Bordetella pertussis</em> infection when pertussis is clinically suspected (<strong>Ungraded, Consensus Based Statement</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic cough, the Expert Panel recommends not routinely performing additional tests (e.g., skin prick test, Mantoux, bronchoscopy, chest computed tomography [CT]); these should be individualized and undertaken in accordance with the clinical setting and the child's clinical symptoms and signs (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &gt;6 years and &le;14 years with chronic cough and asthma clinically suspected, the Expert Panel suggests that a test for airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) be considered (<strong>Grade 2C</strong>). </li>

<div class="content_para"><p>The review authors undertook the systematic reviews based on the protocol established by selected members of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) expert cough panel. They used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement for reporting. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Identification and Eligibility Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Librarians from the University of Massachusetts Medical School undertook searches for all three questions between February 28 and March 11, 2015, using the search strategies outlined in e-Table 1 in the systematic review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). For the CHEST cough guidelines, it was determined a priori that the age cutoff for pediatric and adult components was to be 14 years. However, to ensure that all relevant studies were captured, the search filter included studies up to age 18 years. They included only studies published in English. The librarians identified and removed duplicates between Scopus and PubMed searches before sending the abstracts to the two authors who reviewed the abstracts. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</strong></span></p>
<p>The two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts and fully agreed on which full-text articles to retrieve to assess for potentially eligible studies. It was planned that disagreements that could not be resolved by consensus would be adjudicated by a third reviewer.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Data Extraction and Quality Assessment</strong></span></p>
<p>For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias criteria using criteria in Cochrane Reviews. Criteria used were random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) to the study protocol, blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), and selective reporting (reporting bias). For cohort studies, data were extracted by a single author and checked by a second. In cohort studies, the authors reported on the study's setting, number enrolled and completing the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and other factors (see Tables 1-3 in the systematic review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) that they considered important for interpreting studies on chronic cough specific to the key questions (KQs). These factors included an a priori definition for diagnoses, how cough was measured and resolution defined, and whether the period effect was considered. Reasons for these factors, considered quality factors for pediatric cough studies, are published elsewhere.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) cough guidelines, it was a priori determined that the age cutoff for pediatric and adult components was 14 years. The Expert Panel used a standard method as previously described by Vertigan et al.: "The methodology used by the CHEST Guideline Oversight Committee to select the Expert Cough Panel Chair and the international panel of experts, perform the synthesis of the evidence and develop the recommendations and suggestions has been published. Key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for this topic. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality, and were used to support the evidence-based graded recommendations or suggestions. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was employed to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. The total number of eligible voters for each guideline statement varied based on the number of managed individuals recused from voting on any particular statements because of their potential conflicts of interest. Transparency of process was documented. Further details of the methods have been published elsewhere. Consistent with recent recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, the Panel conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature to provide the evidence base for this guideline."</p>
<p>See the methodology companions in the "Availability of Companion Documents" field for additional information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guideline Framework</strong></span></p>
<p>As previously described, "the American College of Chest Physicians has adopted the GRADE framework (The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). This framework separates the process of rating the quality of evidence from that of determining the strength of recommendation. The quality of evidence is based on the five domains of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, reporting bias and imprecision. The quality of evidence (i.e., the confidence in estimates) is rated as high (A), moderate (B), low or very low (C). The strength of recommendation is determined based on the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, and availability of resources. Recommendations can be strong or weak." </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>State of the Available Evidence</strong></span> </p>
<p>The systematic reviews (and e-Appendix 1, e-Tables 4 and 5, e-Figs 4 and 5 [see the "Availability of Companion Documents field]) identified high-quality evidence to support some recommendations but not all. When there was insufficient evidence for diagnosis and management recommendations, the panel heavily placed great emphasis on patient values, preferences, ease and cost of tests, and availability of potential therapies. The panel also made several suggestions for future research.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Review Process</strong></span></p>
<p>After the Cough Executive Committee provided final approval, the NetWorks, Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC), and Board of Regents disseminated manuscripts and supporting documentation for review. The CHEST NetWorks of interested members, in the areas of Airways Disorders, Allied Health, Clinical Pulmonary Medicine, Pediatric Chest Medicine, Pulmonary Physiology Function and Rehabilitation, and Respiratory Care, reviewed the content of the manuscripts. Members from the CHEST Board of Regents and GOC reviewed both content and methods, including consistency, accuracy, and completeness. The CHEST journal peer review process overlapped with the later rounds of these reviews. All ideas for modification were marked as mandatory or suggested, responded to or justified, and tracked through the multiple rounds of review. The CHEST Presidential line of succession provided the final approval allowing submission to the journal.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Early diagnosis is important, as delayed diagnosis (e.g., foreign body) may cause chronic respiratory morbidity, whereas early diagnosis of chronic disease leads to appropriate management and subsequent resolution of cough and improved quality of life (QoL). Use of cough algorithms or pathways can potentially lead to earlier diagnosis and reduce morbidity, unnecessary costs, and medication use associated with chronic cough. </li>
    <li>The variations in algorithms raise the question of whether algorithms that are specific to the clinical setting should be used, such as in developing countries, where the most common causes of cough are likely different (e.g., tuberculosis, parasitic disease). Irrespective of the relative prevalence of different conditions, the correct diagnosis would be obtained if a cough pathway such as the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guideline is used. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Recognition of cough pointers (see Table 1 in original guideline document) is dependent on accurate identification (i.e., expertise of physicians and the caregiver's history). </li>
    <li>Ascribing causes for the cough has an inherent high risk of bias related to the placebo and "period effects" (the natural resolution of cough over time) evident in cough-related intervention studies. </li>

<p>American College of Chest Physician (CHEST) guidelines are intended for general information only, are not medical advice, and do not replace professional medical care and physician advice, which always should be sought for any medical condition. The complete disclaimer for this guideline can be accessed at <a href="http://www.chestnet.org/Guidelines-and-Resources" title="CHEST Journal Web site">http://www.chestnet.org/Guidelines-and-Resources</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential Biases in the Review Process</span></strong></p>
<p>One of the authors was involved in the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other cohort studies included in these systematic reviews. However, the authors took steps to reduce potential bias by having another author reviewing the extracted data; the risk of bias assessments was undertaken independently. </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dissemination</span></strong> </p>
<p>After publication, the guidelines were promoted to a wide audience of physicians, other health-care providers, and the public through multiple avenues. Press releases were prepared for both the lay and medical media, with major outreach efforts to all relevant print, broadcast, and Internet media. Panelists located in various large media markets were identified as potential spokespersons for interviews. Social media promotion was facilitated over Twitter, Facebook, CHEST e-Communities, internal and external blogs, and other communication routes. Blast communications were sent to CHEST members with links to the publication and postings on CHEST's Web site.</p>
<p>In addition to publication in <em>CHEST</em>, other derivative products were prepared to help with implementation, including slide sets, algorithms, and other clinical tools. These derivative products are posted on the CHEST Web site and will be made available in CHEST Guidelines. CHEST Guidelines will be the repository for the most current recommendations and suggestions from all CHEST guidelines, consensus statements, and hybrid documents. This online repository will also house a collection of related resources. </p>
<p>Associations that appointed representatives earlier in the process were asked to consider endorsing the approved guidelines for listing in the final publication. These organizations were requested to help promote the publication to their memberships through newsletters, Web sites, and other means.</p></div>

<p>For practitioners to adhere to guideline or consensus statement recommendations, they must have confidence that the convened experts represent all relevant stakeholders and do not harbor biases that might influence the discussions and resulting clinical recommendations or suggestions. This is even more important when guidance includes consensus of a panel of experts. The chair of this project was vetted and determined to be free of conflicts of interest (COIs). The Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC) Policies and Procedures Subcommittee and the full GOC, in accordance with explicit rules regarding COI and expertise, carefully reviewed all nominees. Greater explanations of these and other evidence-based processes are published separately. The panel is predominantly free of relevant COIs. A few individuals with moderate conflicts, whose expertise was highly valued and who could not be easily replaced, were selected. These panelists were given individualized management plans and restricted from writing and voting on clinical content areas related to current conflicts and participation in future activities that could be perceived as conflicts.</p>
