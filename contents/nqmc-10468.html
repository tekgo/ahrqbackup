Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who had hepatitis B virus (HBV) status assessed and results interpreted within one year prior to receiving a first course of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.</p></div>
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Before initiating biologic anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy for a patient with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it is essential to screen the patient for hepatitis B virus (HBV), as research has documented reactivation of HBV after anti-TNF therapy. This is a patient safety measure. </p>
<p>Opportunity for improvement: While there are a limited number of studies that investigate gaps in care for patients with IBD, the research that does exist identifies opportunities for improvement in care areas: 1) there is a lack of adherence to documentation of HBV screening, most noticeably in the use of disease-modifying anti-TNF drugs, and 2) variations in care by practice setting, geographic region and physician specialty. </p>
<p>Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has been reported in patients who are carriers of this virus and are taking TNF blocker medicines (Kaiser et al., 2009). </p>
<p><strong>Clinical Recommendation Statements</strong>: </p>
<p>Infliximab can reactivate latent HBV (Esteve et al., 2004).</p></div>
