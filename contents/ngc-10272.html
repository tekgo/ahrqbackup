Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obst&eacute;trique (FIGO) staging of sarcomas was updated in 2010. A detailed description of this staging system can be found in the Appendix in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>There was limited high level evidence (e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or randomized controlled trials) on gynecologic sarcomas available to inform these guidelines. Recommendations were based largely on data from phase II trials, retrospective reviews, case studies, and in some circumstances non-gynecologic sarcomas, as well as expert opinion.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Principles of Staging</strong></span></p>
<p>Staging investigations may include (in most cases for leiomyosarcoma [LMS] and undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Preoperative computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out extrauterine disease </li>
    <li>Preoperative CT of the chest to rule out lung metastases </li>
</ul>
<p>An expert pathology review should be performed by a pathologist with experience in gynecologic and/or sarcoma pathology.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Treatment</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leiomyosarcoma Options</strong></p>
<p><em>Stage I (Tumour Limited to Uterus)</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

</ul>
<p><em>Stage II (Tumour Extends to the Pelvis)</em></p>
<p>No standard therapy has been established; options include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Regular chest x-ray is recommended; other imaging investigations should be performed, only as clinically indicated. </li>
    <li>Follow-up visits should typically occur every 3 to 6 months during years 1 and 2 and then annually for years 3-5. </li>
    <li>Follow-up visits can also be planned according to risk stratification (i.e., tumour grade, size, and site):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Intermediate/high-risk patients could be seen every 3 to 4 months for the first 2 to 3 years and annually thereafter. </li>
        <li>Low-risk patients could be seen every 4 to 6 months for the first 3 to 5 years and annually thereafter. </li>

<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (Patient or Population, Intervention, Comparisons, Outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>What is the optimal surgical staging for leiomyosarcoma? </li>
    <li>What is the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for leiomyosarcoma? </li>
    <li>For leiomyosarcoma, is there a role for hormonal adjuvant therapy? </li>

    <li>What treatment options exist for metastatic or recurrent endometrial stromal sarcoma and undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Entries to Medline and EMBASE and clinical practice guideline databases (e.g., National Guideline Clearinghouse, CancerView, etc.) were searched for evidence relevant to this topic. Search terms included: leiomyosarcoma or adenosarcoma uterine or endometrial stromal sarcoma AND bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy or lymphadenectomy or surgery or surgical resection or chemotherapy or radiotherapy or megestrol acetate or medroxyprogesterone or progestin. Among the relevant studies returned by the search, those that did not report response rates or survival rates were further excluded.</p>
<p>The original search returned a total of 86 studies, including clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case studies, which were included in the review. The 2013 update of the literature returned a total of 10 new studies which were considered when reviewing the recommendations.</p>
<p>Existing guidelines considered for this review include the following: the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (2010), the BC Cancer Agency (BCCA) guidelines (2000), the National Cancer Institute guidelines (2008) and the Tom Baker Cancer Centre guidelines (2008).</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulate the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>An effort was made to either adapt or adopt the most appropriate guidelines from other sources so that work wasn't duplicated. An evidence-based perspective was used to draft proposals. Where evidence was weak, recommendations were based on group consensus.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it will be sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>
