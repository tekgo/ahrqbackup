<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: The original guideline document provides guidance for assessing patients for factors associated with unplanned intraoperative hypothermia, monitoring patient temperatures, preventing unplanned perioperative patient hypothermia, and developing policies and procedures and education for perioperative personnel related to maintaining patient normothermia.</p>
<p>Definitions for the strength of the recommendation is provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;" start="1">
    <li>The perioperative registered nurse (RN) should perform a preoperative nursing assessment to determine the presence of factors that could contribute to unplanned hypothermia. </li>
    <li>The patient's temperature should be measured and monitored in all phases of perioperative care. </li>
    <li>In all phases of perioperative care, the perioperative RN should develop an individualized plan of care and implement the interventions chosen for prevention of unplanned hypothermia. </li>
    <li>A quality improvement (QI)/management program should be in place to identify and respond to opportunities for improvement related to unplanned perioperative hypothermia. </li>
    <li>Health care personnel should receive education about hypothermia as applicable to the person's job responsibilities. [<strong>3: Moderate Evidence</strong>] </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic literature search of the Ovid MEDLINE&reg; and EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL&reg;) databases on August 23 and September 4, 2013, respectively, and limited results to meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized trials and studies, reviews, and guidelines. The librarian also conducted a non-systematic search of Scopus&reg; on September 13, 2013. All searches were limited to literature published in English between January 2007 and the search date. At the time of the initial search, the librarian also established weekly alerts on the topics included in the initial search. The librarian later added terms from subsequent supplementary searches to the alerts and presented relevant results to the lead author. On March 7, 2014, the librarian conducted supplementary searches and in February 2015, reconducted searches to identify articles that had been published since the original searches but that were not captured in the established alerts. The alerts were terminated in April 2015.</p>
<p>Broad search terms included <em>perioperative period, perioperative nursing, normothermia; accidental, unplanned, inadvertent, unintentional, core,</em> and <em>redistribution hypothermia; shivering; operative surgical procedures; anesthesia; heat loss; heat distribution; body temperature regulation; thermal management; thermoregulatory response threshold; thermoregulatory vasoconstriction;</em> and <em>hypothermia</em>. Terms related to rewarming included <em>heat loss; preoperative, intraoperative,</em> and <em>comfort warming; warming technique; warming blanket; energy transfer</em> and <em>thermal pad</em>; <em>forced-air</em> and <em>convective warming; negative pressure rewarming; circulating water garment; cutaneous warming system; resistive heating; inspired gas humidification; intravenous infusing warming; warming irrigation;</em> and brand names of warming devices. Temperature-monitoring terms included <em>intraoperative monitoring; thermography; skin-surface temperature gradient;</em> and types of temperature and thermometers (e.g., <em>skin, esophageal, tympanic, temporal artery, oral, axillary</em>). Other search terms included <em>intraoperative and perioperative complications; risk factors (</em>e.g., <em>blood transfusion, obesity, diabetic neuropathies, pneumatic tourniquet); pressure ulcers; decubitus ulcers;</em> and <em>burns</em>.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, relevance to the key questions, and publication dates within the time restriction unless none were available.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications; literature that examined shivering, traumatic hypothermia, intentional or therapeutic hypothermia, anesthesia techniques to manage hypothermia, malignant hyperthermia, and bundling of treatment or preventative measures. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher quality evidence was available, and literature outside the time restriction was excluded when literature within the time restriction was available (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document for a flow diagram of literature search results).</p></div>
