Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of perioperative Registered Nurses (AORN)</strong>: The original guideline document provides guidance to the perioperative team for the safe use and maintenance of energy-generating devices. The types of energy addressed in this document include electricity delivered as radio-frequency waves, ultrasound, and laser. The devices that generate the energy include electrosurgical units (ESUs), electrocauteries, ultrasonic instruments, and lasers. The energy produced is transferred to the patient by various methods, including monopolar, bipolar, advanced bipolar (e.g., vessel-sealing), and tripolar (e.g., plasma knife) devices; class 3 and class 4 lasers; and ultrasound (e.g., ultrasonic tissue ablation system, phacoemulsification) and argon-enhanced coagulation (AEC) modalities.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk for injury to patients and personnel during the use of energy-generating devices. </li>
    <li>Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk for injury associated with the use of electrosurgical units and electrosurgical accessories. </li>
    <li>Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk for injury associated with the use of electrosurgery during minimally invasive surgery. </li>
    <li>A laser safety program should be established for all owned, leased, or borrowed laser equipment in any location where lasers are used (ECRI, 2011; "Z136.3: Safe use of lasers in health care," 2011; "Z136.1: Safe use of lasers," 2014). </li>
    <li>Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk for injury associated with the use of a laser (Dhepe, 2009; Hospital eTools, 2016). </li>
    <li>Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk for injury associated with the use of a phacoemulsifier. </li>
    <li>Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk of injury associated with the use of AEC. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic search of the databases MEDLINE&reg;, CINAHL&reg;, and Scopus&reg; and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in October 2015. Results were limited to literature published in English from January 2009 through October 2015. The medical librarian also established alerts at the time of the initial search. During the development of the guideline, the lead author requested supplementary searches and additional articles that either did not fit the original search criteria or were discovered during the evidence appraisal process. The results of alerts were considered until February 2016.</p>
<p>The search terms included subject headings and keywords that address precautions and injuries related to the use of electrosurgical and laser devices. Terms for procedures included <em>electrosurgery, ultrasonic therapy, ultrasonic surgical procedures, diathermy, argon plasma coagulation, electrocoagulation, high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, endometrial ablation techniques, and laser therapy</em>. Subject headings and keywords related to precautions included <em>adverse effects, accident prevention, patient safety, equipment contamination, equipment safety, equipment failure,</em> and <em>risk management</em>. Special attention was paid to terms that would retrieve literature addressing the potential causes and effects of equipment failure and injuries. Such terms included <em>burns, fires, implantable electronic devices</em> (e.g., <em>artificial pacemaker, implanted electrodes, electromagnetic fields</em>), and <em>power sources and settings</em> (e.g., <em>electric power supplies, grounding, capacitive coupling, electric wiring</em>). Subject headings and keywords for types of personal protective equipment and occupational hazards also were included.</p>
<p>Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications, evidence from other disciplines when evidence from the perioperative setting was available, and case reports that did not provide recommendations for preventing injuries related to the use of electrosurgical devices. Editorials, news items, and other brief items were excluded. Lower-level or lower-quality evidence was excluded when higher-level or higher-quality evidence was available.</p></div>

The literature was independently evaluated and appraised according to the strength and quality of the evidence. Each article was then assigned an appraisal score.

<div class="content_para"><p>The collective evidence supporting each intervention within a specific recommendation was summarized and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Evidence Rating Model (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field) was used to rate the strength of the evidence. Factors considered in the review of the collective evidence were the quality of the evidence, the quantity of similar evidence on a given topic, and the consistency of evidence supporting a recommendation. The evidence rating is noted in brackets after each intervention in the original guideline document.</p></div>
