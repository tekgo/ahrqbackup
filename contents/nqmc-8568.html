<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The pathogenesis of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is poorly understood. Symptoms usually present within 3 years after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and are often preceded by a history of acute GVHD. Manifestations of chronic GVHD may be restricted to a single organ or tissue or may be widespread. Chronic GVHD can lead to debilitating consequences, e.g., joint contractures, loss of sight, end-stage lung disease, or mortality resulting from profound chronic immune suppression leading to recurrent or life-threatening infections. </p>
<p><em>Support (verbatim) from National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Project</em>: The time-honored description of limited versus extensive chronic GVHD was proposed from only 20 cases published in 1980. The [NIH] Working Group proposes a new global assessment of chronic GVHD severity that is clinically suitable and is appropriate for use as an inclusion criterion in therapeutic clinical trials or as an indication for systemic immunosuppressive treatment. The global scoring system reflects the clinical effect of chronic GVHD on the patient's functional status. </p>
<p>Elements included in the proposed global scoring system include both the number of organs or sites involved and the severity within each affected organ (note that performance status scoring is not incorporated into the global scoring system). The global descriptions of mild, moderate, and severe were chosen to reflect the degree of organ impact and functional impairment due to chronic GVHD. Although scoring is often used at the time of initial diagnosis, evaluating the clinical score periodically during the course of chronic GVHD may revise prognostic expectations and better describe the current severity of chronic GVHD.</p>
<p><em>Statement from American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) Task Force on guidelines</em>: The proposed scoring tool is provisional and will be updated as the results of prospective validation studies become available (see the original measure documentation for details). Use of the tool will add structure to therapeutic options (topical versus systemic) and enable improved clinical trials which will result in further improvements to evidence based guidelines. Early research results indicate the scores calculated using the NIH tool to have prognostic significance. </p>
<p><em>Statements (verbatim) on gap</em>: Clinical syndromes resembling acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) are increasingly recognized beyond 100 days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and may be labeled as cGVHD. In addition, patients with aGVHD may progress to develop cGVHD with distinctive signs and symptoms of both acute and chronic GVHD. In addition, the old grading system of limited versus extensive GVHD was designed to identify patients needing systemic immune suppression and does not capture the severity of individual organ involvement. Several grading schemes can predict survival following cGVHD. However, all lack consistent scoring and assessment of each involved organ to determine the overall severity of the disease. Recognizing these limitations, the diagnosis and staging working group of the NIH Consensus Development Project on cGVHD proposed standard criteria for diagnosis, organ scoring and global assessment of cGVHD severity. </p>
<p><em>Statement from the ASBMT Task Force on gap</em>: The most recent standardized scoring system was released in September 2005 and is relatively new to the transplant community. Not all transplant physicians are yet aware of or using the scoring system. We believe there is a critical need for more education to drive awareness of the new system to close the gap in use. </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Reported incidence rates of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after allogeneic transplantation range from 6% to 80% according to recipient age, donor type, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) source (peripheral blood, bone marrow, or umbilical cord blood stem cells), graft manipulation (T-cell depletion), and use of post transplantation donor lymphocyte infusion (DLIs). Reliable incidence estimates in different cohorts of HCT recipients are compromised by (1) lack of standardized, widely used diagnostic guidelines; (2) variability in observer experience; (3) limited expert follow-up at a distance from transplant centers; (4) differences in the statistical methods applied (e.g., use of the Kaplan-Meier versus cumulative incidence estimates and variable requirement for some minimal survival [60-100 days] for patients to be considered at risk of chronic GVHD); and (5) the sometimes protean nature of early chronic GVHD symptoms, which mimic alternative diagnoses.</p></div>
