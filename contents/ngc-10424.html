<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the body of evidence strength (<strong>grade A, B, </strong>or<strong> C</strong>), the strength of the recommendations (<strong>Standard, Recommendation, Option</strong>), and for statements labeled as <strong>Clinical Principle</strong> and <strong>Expert Opinion</strong> are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Providers should obtain gestational history at initial evaluation of boys with suspected cryptorchidism. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Primary care providers should palpate testes for quality and position at each recommended well-child visit. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Providers should refer infants with a history of cryptorchidism (detected at birth) who do not have spontaneous testicular descent by six months (corrected for gestational age) to an appropriate surgical specialist for timely evaluation. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Providers should refer boys with the possibility of newly diagnosed (acquired) cryptorchidism after six months (corrected for gestational age) to an appropriate surgical specialist. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Providers must immediately consult an appropriate specialist for all phenotypic male newborns with bilateral, nonpalpable testes for evaluation of a possible disorder of sex development (DSD). (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade A</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Providers should not perform ultrasound (US) or other imaging modalities in the evaluation of boys with cryptorchidism prior to referral as these studies rarely assist in decision making. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Providers should assess the possibility of a disorder of sex development (DSD) when there is increasing severity of hypospadias with cryptorchidism. (<strong><em>Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In boys with bilateral, nonpalpable testes who do not have congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), providers should measure M&uuml;llerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS or Anti-M&uuml;llerian Hormone [AMH]) level), and consider additional hormone testing, to evaluate for anorchia. (<strong><em>Option; Evidence Strength Grade C</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In boys with retractile testes, providers should monitor the position of the testes at least annually to monitor for secondary ascent. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="10">
    <li>Providers should not use hormonal therapy to induce testicular descent as evidence shows low response rates and lack of evidence for long-term efficacy. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In the absence of spontaneous testicular descent by six months (corrected for gestational age), specialists should perform surgery within the next year. (<em><strong>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>In prepubertal boys with palpable, cryptorchid testes, surgical specialists should perform scrotal or inguinal orchidopexy. (<strong><em>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In prepubertal boys with nonpalpable testes, surgical specialists should perform examination under anesthesia to reassess for palpability of testes. If nonpalpable, surgical exploration and, if indicated, abdominal orchidopexy should be performed. (<em><strong>Standard; Evidence Strength Grade B</strong></em>) </li>
    <li>At the time of exploration for a nonpalpable testis in boys, surgical specialists should identify the status of the testicular vessels to help determine the next course of action. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>In boys with a normal contralateral testis, surgical specialists may perform an orchiectomy (removal of the undescended testis) if a boy has a normal contralateral testis and either very short testicular vessels and vas deferens, dysmorphic or very hypoplastic testis, or postpubertal age. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>
    <li>Providers should counsel boys with a history of cryptorchidism and/or monorchidism and their parents regarding potential long-term risks and provide education on infertility and cancer risk. (<strong><em>Clinical Principle</em></strong>) </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The primary source of evidence for this guideline was the systematic review and data extraction conducted as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Comparative Effectiveness Review titled <em>Evaluation and Treatment of Cryptorchidism</em> (2012). That report included rigorous searches of MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and EMBASE for English-language studies published from January 1980 through February 2012 relevant to cryptorchidism. To capture more recently published manuscripts and expand the body of evidence provided in the original AHRQ report, the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) conducted additional supplementary searches of PubMed and EMBASE for relevant articles published between January 1980 and March 2013 that were systematically reviewed using a methodology developed <em>a priori</em>.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Quality of Studies and Determination of Evidence Strength</strong></p>
<p>Quality of individual studies was rated as high, moderate, or low based on instruments tailored to specific study designs. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Conventional diagnostic cohort studies, diagnostic case-control studies, or diagnostic case series that presented data on diagnostic test characteristics were evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool that evaluates the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies. Cohort studies with a comparison of interest were evaluated with the Drug Effectiveness Review Project instrument. The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies. Evidence strength refers to the body of evidence available for a particular question and includes consideration of study design, individual study quality, consistency of findings across studies, adequacy of sample sizes, and generalizability of samples, settings and treatments for the purposes of the guideline. The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) categorizes body of evidence strength as Grade A (well-conducted RCTs or exceptionally strong observational studies), Grade B (RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or generally strong observational studies) or Grade C (observational studies that are inconsistent, have small sample sizes or have other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data). The quality of the evidence was variable depending on the issue examined. For many epidemiological issues there was a combination of moderate to large sized population-based studies, some of them prospective, being the key issue, as well as the consistency of findings. When evidence was consistent it was graded B, otherwise C. For issues related to management, studies tend to be non-randomized cohorts of moderate size or randomized trials of small to moderate size. Again the key issue was consistency of findings and the same criterion indicated above was applied. Seventy percent of the graded statements were considered level B (many under the AUA's premise of moderate quality, moderate certainty).</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of the Literature</strong></p>
<p>Limitations of the literature identified by both the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the AUA reviews include (1) lack of studies assessing the value of hormonal stimulation testing, long-term fertility outcomes, as well as inconsistent reporting of age at diagnosis and/or at treatment; (2) scant information about imaging effectiveness for modalities other than ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (3) low level evidence for the effectiveness of surgical treatment other than primary orchidopexy, accompanied by a lack of a standardized definition of success, follow-up length, reporting of complications, and control of confounding variables by indication; (4) inconsistent control of confounding variables among studies evaluating the epidemiology of cryptorchidism. This could be the result of the remaining uncertainty with respect to the etiological factors strongly and consistently associated with cryptorchidism.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This document was written by the Cryptorchidism Panel of the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA), which was created in 2013. The Practice Guidelines Committee (PGC) of the AUA selected the committee chair. Panel members were selected by the chair. Membership of the committee included urologists and other clinicians with specific expertise on this disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Linking Statement Type to Evidence Strength</strong></p>
<p>The AUA nomenclature system explicitly links statement type to body of evidence strength and the Panel's judgment regarding the balance between benefits and risks/burdens (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p>In some instances, the review revealed insufficient publications to address certain questions from an evidence basis; therefore, some statements are provided as <em>Clinical Principles</em> or as <em>Expert Opinions</em> with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique if differences of opinion emerged. A <em>Clinical Principle</em> is a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature. <em>Expert Opinion</em> refers to a statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge and judgment for which there is no evidence.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>While these guidelines do not necessarily establish the standard of care, the American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. (AUA) seeks to recommend and to encourage compliance by practitioners with current best practices related to the condition being treated. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, the guidelines will change. Today these evidence-based guidelines statements represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals for treatment under the specific conditions described in each document. For all these reasons, the guidelines do not pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases. </li>
    <li>Treating physicians must take into account variations in resources, and patient tolerances, needs, and preferences. Conformance with any clinical guideline does not guarantee a successful outcome. The guideline text may include information or recommendations about certain drug uses ("off label") that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or about medications or substances not subject to the FDA approval process. AUA urges strict compliance with all government regulations and protocols for prescription and use of these substances. The physician is encouraged to carefully follow all available prescribing information about indications, contraindications, precautions and warnings. These guidelines and best practice statements are not in-tended to provide legal advice about use and misuse of these substances. </li>
    <li>Although guidelines are intended to encourage best practices and potentially encompass available technologies with sufficient data as of close of the literature review, they are necessarily time-limited. Guidelines cannot include evaluation of all data on emerging technologies or management, including those that are FDA-approved, which may immediately come to represent accepted clinical practices. </li>
    <li>For this reason, the AUA does not regard technologies or management which are too new to be addressed by this guideline as necessarily experimental or investigational. </li>
