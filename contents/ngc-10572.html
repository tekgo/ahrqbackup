<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adult Weight Management (AWM): Screening and Referral for Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>AWM: Annual Screening for Overweight/Obesity</strong></p>
<p>The registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), in collaboration with other health care professionals, administrators and public policy decision-makers, should ensure that all adult patients have the following measurements at least annually:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Height and weight to calculate body mass index (BMI), classified as overweight (BMI more than 25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or obese
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Class I obesity: BMI 30kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 34.9kg/m<sup>2</sup> </li>
        <li>Class II obesity: BMI 35kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 39.9kg/m<sup>2</sup> </li>
        <li>Class III (extreme) obesity: 40kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Waist circumference to determine the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes and all-cause mortality
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NIH/NHLBI)
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Men: More than 102 cm (more than 40 inches) </li>
            <li>Women: More than 88 cm ( more than 35 inches) </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Annual BMI screening will identify adults who are overweight or obese and therefore, may be at elevated risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. In addition, the greater the waist circumference, the greater the risk of CVD, type 2 diabetes and all-cause mortality.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Referral to RDN for MNT</strong></p>
<p>The RDN, in collaboration with other health care professionals, administrators and public policy decision-makers, should ensure that overweight or obese adults are referred to an RDN for MNT. Intensive counseling and behavioral interventions promote sustained weight loss and reduce known risk factors for diet-related chronic disease.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Weight Management for Older Adults</strong></p>
<p>For older adults (aged 65 years and older) who are overweight or obese, the RDN should provide MNT for weight loss and weight maintenance. Research has reported reduced risk of mortality, reduced development of type 2 diabetes and improved cardiovascular risk factors with intentional weight loss in older persons and weight gain produces increased risk for several health outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Assess Data to Individualize the Comprehensive Weight Management Program</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should assess the following data in order to individualize the comprehensive weight management program for overweight and obese adults:</p>
<p>Food- and nutrition-related history, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Beliefs and attitudes, including food preferences and motivation </li>
    <li>Food environment, including access to fruits and vegetables </li>
    <li>Dietary behaviors, including eating out and screen time </li>
    <li>Diet experience, including food allergies and past dieting history </li>
    <li>Medications and supplements </li>

</ul>
<p>Anthropometric measurements, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Height, weight, BMI </li>
    <li>Waist circumference </li>

</ul>
<p>Moderately strong evidence indicates that the food environment is associated with dietary intake, especially less consumption of vegetables and fruits and higher body weight. Strong and consistent evidence indicates that adults who eat fast food often are at increased risk of weight gain, overweight and obesity and that screen time, especially television screen time, is directly associated with increased overweight and obesity.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AWM: Assess Motivation for Weight Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>AWM: Assess Motivation for Weight Management</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should assess motivation, readiness and self-efficacy for weight management, based on behavior change theories and models (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, transtheoretical model and social cognitive theory/social learning theory). While research supports cognitive-behavioral therapy as an effective method of overweight and obesity treatment, there is limited research in the areas of the transtheoretical model and social cognitive theory and social learning theory.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AWM: Assess Energy Needs</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>AWM: Measure Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)</strong></p>
<p>If indirect calorimetry is available, the RDN should use a measured RMR to determine energy needs in overweight or obese adults. Measurement of RMR using indirect calorimetry is more accurate than estimating RMR using predictive equations.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>AWM: Use Mifflin-St. Jeor Equation to Estimate RMR</strong></p>
<p>If indirect calorimetry is not available, the RDN should use the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation using actual weight to estimate RMR in overweight or obese adults. The majority of research reviewed supports the use of the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation (using actual body weight) to predict RMR in overweight or obese adults because it demonstrated good accuracy and correlation with indirect calorimetry.</p>
<p><strong>Strong</strong>, Conditional</p>
<p><strong>AWM: Estimate Total Energy Needs</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should multiply the RMR (measured or estimated) by one of the following physical activity factors to estimate total energy needs:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Sedentary</em>: 1.0 or more to less than 1.4 </li>
    <li><em>Low active</em>: 1.4 or more to less than 1.6 </li>
    <li><em>Active</em>: 1.6 or more to less than 1.9 </li>
    <li><em>Very active</em>: 1.9 or more to less than 2.5. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AWM: Realistic Weight Goal Setting</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>AWM: Realistic Weight Goal Setting</strong></p>
<p>The RDN should collaborate with the individual regarding a realistic weight loss goal, such as one of the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Up to two pounds per week </li>
    <li>Up to 10% of baseline body weight </li>
    <li>A total of 3% to 5% of baseline body weight if cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia) are present </li>
</ul>
<p>Studies regarding the effectiveness of MNT for under six months reported significant weight losses of approximately one to two pounds per week, and six to 12 months of MNT resulted in significant mean weight losses of up to 10% of body weight. While a sustained weight loss of 3% to 5% is likely to result in clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, greater amounts of weight loss will also reduce blood pressure, improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and reduce the need for medications.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Components of a Comprehensive Weight Management Program</strong></p>
<p>For weight loss and weight maintenance, the RDN should include the following components as part of a comprehensive weight management program:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Reduced calorie diet </li>
    <li>Increasing physical activity </li>
    <li>Use of behavioral strategies </li>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AWM: Caloric Reduction and Nutrient Adequacy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>AWM: Achieve Nutrient Adequacy during Weight Loss</strong></p>
<p>During weight loss, the RDN should prescribe an individualized diet, including patient preferences and health status, to achieve and maintain nutrient adequacy and reduce caloric intake, based on one of the following caloric reduction strategies:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>1,200 kcal to 1,500 kcal per day for women and 1,500 kcal to 1,800 kcal per day for men (kcal levels are usually adjusted for the individual's body weight) </li>
    <li>Energy deficit of approximately 500 kcal per day or 750 kcal per day </li>
    <li>One of the evidence-based diets that restricts certain food types (such as high-carbohydrate foods, low-fiber foods, or high-fat foods) in order to create an energy deficit by reduced food intake </li>
</ul>
<p>Several studies report changes in nutrient adequacy with caloric restriction, however the extent of nutrient inadequacy and the nutrients affected are dependent on the composition of the diet followed, as well as on the nutritional needs of the individual. Limited research reports reductions in nutrient adequacy with weight loss through an energy restriction of at least 500 kcal per day or daily consumption below 1,200 kcal per day.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Maintain Nutrient Adequacy during Weight Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>During weight maintenance, the RDN should prescribe an individualized diet (including patient preferences and health status) to maintain nutrient adequacy and reduce caloric intake for maintaining a lower body weight. Several studies report changes in nutrient adequacy with caloric restriction, however the extent of nutrient inadequacy and the nutrients affected are dependent on the composition of the diet followed, as well as on the nutritional needs of the individual. Limited research reports reductions in nutrient adequacy with weight loss through an energy restriction of at least 500 kcal per day or daily consumption below 1,200 kcal per day.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Dietary Approaches for Caloric Reduction in Weight Loss</strong></p>
<p>For weight loss, the RDN should advise overweight or obese adults that as long as the target reduction in calorie level is achieved, many different dietary approaches are effective. There is strong and consistent evidence that when calorie intake is controlled, macronutrient proportion, glycemic index and glycemic load of the diet are not related to losing weight.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Dietary Approaches for Caloric Reduction in Weight Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>For weight maintenance, the RDN should advise overweight and obese adults that as long as the target reduction in calorie level is achieved, many different dietary approaches are effective. A moderate body of evidence provides no data to suggest that any one macronutrient is more effective than any other for avoiding weight re-gain in weight-reduced persons. Strong and consistent evidence shows that glycemic index and glycemic load are not associated with body weight and do not lead to better weight maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Eating Frequency and Meal Patterns for Weight Loss and Weight Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>For weight loss and weight maintenance, the RDN should individualize the meal pattern to distribute calories at meals and snacks throughout the day, including breakfast. Research reports inconsistent results regarding the association between eating frequency and body weight, which may be due to the role of portion size, energy density or compensation of energy intake at subsequent eating occasions. The majority of observational research reported that breakfast consumption is associated with a lower BMI and decreased obesity risk, while omitting breakfast is associated with a higher BMI and increased obesity risk. Several studies suggest that cereal-based breakfasts are associated with lower BMI, while breakfasts that are very high in energy are associated with higher BMI.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Encourage Physical Activity for Weight Loss</strong></p>
<p>For weight loss, the RDN should encourage physical activity as part of a comprehensive weight management program, individualized to gradually accumulate 150 to 420 minutes or more of physical activity per week, depending on intensity, unless medically contraindicated. Physical activity less than 150 minutes per week promotes minimal weight loss, physical activity more than 150 minutes per week results in modest weight loss of approximately 2 kg to 3 kg, and physical activity of more than 225 to 420 minutes per week results in 5 kg to 7.5 kg weight loss, and a dose&ndash;response exists.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus</strong>, Imperative</p>
<p><strong>AWM: Encourage Physical Activity for Weight Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>For weight maintenance, the RDN should encourage physical activity as part of a comprehensive weight management program, individualized to accumulate 200 to 300 minutes or more of physical activity per week, depending on intensity, unless medically contraindicated. Some studies support the value of approximately 200 to 300 minutes per week of physical activity during weight maintenance to reduce weight regain after weight loss.</p>

<p><strong>AWM: Multiple Behavior Therapy Strategies</strong></p>
<p>For weight loss and weight maintenance, the RDN should incorporate one or more of the following strategies for behavior therapy:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Self-monitoring</em>: Strong evidence shows that for adults who need or desire to lose weight or for adults who are maintaining body weight following weight loss, self-monitoring of food intake improves nutrition-related outcomes related to weight loss and weight maintenance. </li>
    <li><em>Motivational interviewing</em>: Research demonstrated that motivational interviewing significantly enhanced adherence to program recommendations and improved targeted diet-related outcomes including glycemic control, percentage of energy intake from fat, fruit and vegetable intake and weight loss. </li>
    <li><em>Structured meal plans and meal replacements and portion control</em>: Research reports that the use of various types of meal replacements or structured meal plans was helpful in achieving health and food behavior change and strong evidence documents a positive relationship between portion size and body weight. </li>
    <li><em>Goal-setting</em>: Clients' active participation in selecting and setting goals led to the selection of a goal from the area that could use the most improvement and the goal that was most personally appropriate. </li>
    <li><em>Problem-solving</em>: Studies based on the use of problem-solving strategies resulted in improvements in key outcome measures, including maintenance of weight loss and in subjects with diabetes, was linked to improvements in fat consumption, self-efficacy and physical activity. </li>
</ul>

    <li>Cognitive restructuring </li>
    <li>Contingency management </li>
    <li>Relapse prevention techniques </li>

<p><strong>AWM: Coordinate Care with Interdisciplinary Team</strong></p>
<p>For weight loss and weight maintenance, the RDN should implement MNT and coordinate care with an interdisciplinary team of health professionals (may include specialized RDNs, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physicians, physician assistants, physical therapists, psychologists, social workers, and so on), especially for patients with obesity-related co-morbid conditions. Coordination of care may include collaboration on:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved weight-loss medications </li>
    <li>Appropriateness of bariatric surgery for people who have not achieved weight loss goals with less invasive weight loss methods </li>

<p><strong>Conditional vs Imperative Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Recommendations are categorized in terms of either <em><strong>conditional</strong></em> or <em><strong>imperative</strong></em> statements. While conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population and do not impose restraints on their application.</p>
<p>Conditional recommendations are presented in an if/then format, such that:</p>
<p>If CONDITION then ACTION(S) because REASON(S).</p>
<p>Fulfillment of the condition triggers one or more guideline-specified actions. In contrast, imperative recommendations include terms such as "require," "must," and "should," and do not contain conditional text that would limit their applicability to specified circumstances.</p>

<p class="Note">*Conclusion statements are assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. Grade I is good; grade II, fair; grade III, limited; grade IV signifies expert opinion only and grade V indicates that a grade is not assignable because there is no evidence to support or refute the conclusion. The evidence and these grades are considered when assigning a rating (Strong, Fair, Weak, Consensus, Insufficient Evidence - see chart above) to a recommendation.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>General Methods for Collecting/Selecting the Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The following list provides an overview of the steps which the Academy evidence analysis team goes through to identify research through database searches.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Plan the search strategy</strong> to identify the current best evidence relevant to the question. The plan for identification and inclusion of articles and reports should be systematic and reproducible, not haphazard. Write out the original search strategy and document adjustments to the strategy if they occur. Allow for several iterations of searches.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>List inclusion and exclusion criteria</strong>. The workgroup will define the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria will be used in defining the search strategy and for filtering the identified research reports. The Academy uses only peer-reviewed research; that is, articles accepted for evidence analysis must be peer-reviewed and published in a juried publication. Additionally, the Academy only uses human subjects in its research and does not include animal studies in its evidence analysis. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify search words</strong>. During the process of considering outcomes, interventions, nutrition diagnoses, and assessments, the work group may have identified a number of specific terms or factors that were important, but were not included in the actual question. These terms can be used as additional search terms to help identify relevant pieces of research. Both text word search and keyword search using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) definitions may be used. </li>
        <li><strong>Identify databases to search</strong>. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, Agricola, DARE, TRIP, AHRQ and ERIC are some common databases for clinical nutritional research. Note that search terms can vary depending on the database. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conduct the search</strong>. Depending on the number and type of sources found in the initial search, adjustments might have to be made in the search strategy and to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and additional searches run. Changes to the search plan should be recorded for future reference. Document the number of sources identified in each search. </li>
    <li><strong>Review titles and abstracts</strong>. At this point, a filtering procedure is used to determine whether a research article matches the inclusion criteria and is relevant to the work group's questions. Typically, the lead analyst, along with a member of the expert workgroup, first reviews the citations and abstracts to filter out reports that are not applicable to the question. If a determination cannot be made based on the citation and abstract, then the full text of the article is obtained for review. </li>
    <li><strong>Gather all remaining articles and reports</strong>. Obtain paper or electronic copies of research articles that remain on the list following the citation and abstract review. If there are less than six citations, it could mean that the search was too specific to identify relevant research or that research has not been done on this topic. A broadened search should be tried. When there is a long list of citations, ascertain whether it includes articles that are tangential to the question or address the question in only a general way. In this case a more focused search strategy may be necessary. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Specific Methods for This Guideline</strong></p>
<p>The recommendations in the guideline were based on a systematic review of the literature. Searches of PubMed, Medline, CENTRAL, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) database were performed on the following topics:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Metabolic syndrome and disorders of lipid metabolism </li>
    <li>Weight management </li>
    <li>Effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for overweight/obesity in adults </li>
    <li>Telenutrition provided by registered dietician </li>
    <li>Counseling theories </li>
    <li>Mifflin-St. Jeor equation </li>
    <li>Nutrition adequacy </li>
    <li>Meal and snack patterns </li>
    <li>Breakfast consumption </li>
</ul>
<p>Each evidence analysis topic has a link to supporting evidence, where the <strong>Search Plan and Results</strong> can be found. Here, the reader can view when the search plan was performed, inclusion and exclusion criteria, search terms, databases that were searched and the excluded articles.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Step 1: Formulate Evidence Analysis Question</strong></p>
<p>Specify a question in a defined area of practice or state a tentative conclusion or recommendation that is being considered. Include the patient type and special needs of the target population involved, the alternatives under consideration, and the outcomes of interest (PICO format).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Gather and Classify Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Conduct a systematic search of the literature to find evidence related to the question, gather studies and reports, and classify them by type of evidence. Classes differentiate primary reports of new data according to study design, and distinguish them from secondary reports that include systematic and/or narrative review.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Critically Appraise Each Article</strong></p>
<p>Review each article for relevance to the question and use the checklist of questions to evaluate the research design and implementation. Abstract key information from the report.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Summarize Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Synthesize the reports into an overview table and summarize the research relevant to the question.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Write and Grade the Conclusion Statement</strong></p>
<p>Develop a concise conclusion statement (the answer to the question). Assign a grade to indicate the overall strength or weakness of evidence informing the conclusion statement (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Development of Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>The expert work group, which includes practitioners and researchers with a depth of experience in the specific field of interest, develops the disease-specific guideline. The guideline development involves the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li><strong>Review the Conclusion Statements</strong>: The work group meets to review the materials resulting from the evidence analysis, which may include conclusion statements, evidence summaries, and evidence worksheets. </li>
    <li><strong>Formulate Recommendations for the Guideline Integrating Conclusions from Evidence Analysis</strong>: The work group uses an expert consensus method to formulate the guideline recommendations and complete the various sections on the recommendation page. These include:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><strong>Recommendation(s)</strong>: This is a course of action for the practitioner. The recommendation is written using two brief and separate statements. The first statement is "what" the dietitian should do or not do. The second statement describes the "why" of the recommendation. More than one recommendation may be formulated depending on a particular topic and the supporting conclusion statements. </li>
        <li><strong>Rating</strong>: The rating for the recommendation is based on the strength of the supporting evidence. The grade of the supporting conclusion statement(s) will help determine this rating (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). </li>
        <li><strong>Label of Conditional or Imperative</strong>: Each recommendation will have a label of "conditional" or "imperative." Conditional statements clearly define a specific situation, while imperative statements are broadly applicable to the target population without restraints on their pertinence. </li>
        <li><strong>Risks and Harms of Implementing the Recommendations</strong>: Includes any potential risks, anticipated harms or adverse consequences associated with applying the recommendation(s) to the target population. </li>
        <li><strong>Conditions of Application</strong>: Includes any organizational barriers or changes that would need to be made within an organization to apply the recommendation in daily practice. Also includes any conditions which may limit the application of the recommendation(s). For instance, application may be limited to only people in an inpatient setting, or not applicable for pregnant women. Facilitators for the application of the guideline may also be listed here. Conditional recommendations will always have conditions specified. Imperative recommendations may have some general conditions for application. </li>
        <li><strong>Potential Costs Associated with Application</strong>: Includes any costs that may be associated with the application of this recommendation such as specialized staff, new equipment or treatments. </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation Narrative</strong>: Provides a brief description of the evidence that supports this recommendation. </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendation Strength Rationale</strong>: Provides a brief list of the evidence strength and methodological issues that determined the recommendation strength. </li>
        <li><strong>Minority Opinions</strong>: If the expert work group cannot reach consensus on the recommendation, the minority opinions may be listed here. </li>
        <li><strong>Supporting Evidence</strong>: Provides links to the conclusions statements, evidence summaries and worksheets related to the formulation of this recommendation(s). </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process</strong>: Recommendations are based on the summarized evidence from the analysis. Sources that are not analyzed during the evidence analysis process may be used to support and formulate the recommendation or to support information under other categories on the recommendation page, if the workgroup deems necessary. References must be credible resources (e.g., consensus reports, other guidelines, position papers, standards of practice, articles from peer-reviewed journals, nationally recognized documents or websites). If recommendations are based solely on these types of references, they will be rated as "consensus." Occasionally recommendations will include references that were not reviewed during the evidence analysis process but are relevant to the recommendation, risks and harms of implementing the recommendation, conditions of application, or potential costs associated with application. These references will be listed on the recommendation page under "References Not Graded in the Academy's Evidence Analysis Process." </li>
    <li><strong>Develop a Clinical Algorithm for The Guideline</strong>: The workgroup develops a clinical algorithm based on Academy's Nutrition Care Process, to display how each recommendation can be used within the treatment process and how they relate to the Nutrition Assessment, Diagnosis, Intervention and Monitoring and Evaluation. </li>
    <li><strong>Complete the Writing of the Guideline</strong>: Each disease-specific guideline has a similar format which incorporates the Introduction (includes: Scope of the Guideline, Statement of Intent, Guideline Methods, Implementation, Benefits and Risks/Harms of Implementation), Background Information and any necessary Appendices. The work group develops these features. </li>
    <li><strong>Criteria Used in Guideline Development</strong>: The criteria used in determining the format and process for development of Academy's guidelines are based on the following tools and criteria for evidence-based guidelines:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Guideline Elements Model (GEM) which has been incorporated by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a Standard Specification for clinical practice guidelines. </li>
        <li>Appraisal for Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Instrument </li>

<p class="Note">*Conclusion statements are assigned a grade based on the strength of the evidence. Grade I is good; grade II, fair; grade III, limited; grade IV signifies expert opinion only and grade V indicates that a grade is not assignable because there is no evidence to support or refute the conclusion. The evidence and these grades are considered when assigning a rating (Strong, Fair, Weak, Consensus, Insufficient Evidence - see chart above) to a recommendation.</p>

Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A primary goal of implementing these recommendations includes
    improving a person's ability to achieve optimal nutrition through
    healthful food choices and a physically-active lifestyle. </li>
    <li>Although costs of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) sessions and reimbursement vary, MNT is essential for improved outcomes. </li>
    <li>MNT education can be considered cost-effective when considering
    the benefits of nutrition interventions on the onset and progression of
    comorbidities versus the cost of the intervention. </li>
</ul>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overall Risk/Harm Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p>When using these recommendations, consider the following general risks and harms:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Review the patient's age, socio-economic status, cultural issues,&nbsp;psychosocial and mental health status, health history and other health conditions. </li>
    <li>Use clinical judgment in applying the guidelines. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendation-Specific Risks/Harms</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Components of a Comprehensive Weight Management Program</strong></p>
<p>Adequate evidence indicates that the harm of screening and behavioral interventions for obesity is small. Possible harm of behavioral weight-loss interventions include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Decreased bone mineral density and increased fracture risk </li>
    <li>Serious injuries resulting from increased physical activity </li>
    <li>Increased risk for eating disorders </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encourage Physical Activity</strong></p>
<p>Intense physical activity in some overweight and obese individuals may contribute to disability or death; thus, consultation with a physician prior to beginning an exercise program should be recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinate Care with Interdisciplinary Team</strong></p>
<p>Bariatric surgery is associated with complications such as pulmonary embolism and post-operative death.</p></div>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This nutrition practice guideline is meant to serve as a general framework for handling clients with particular health problems. The independent skill and judgment of the health care provider must always dictate treatment decisions. </li>
    <li>This guideline is intended for use by registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) involved in providing medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for adult weight management. The application of the guideline must be individualized to assist the RDN to successfully integrate MNT into the overall medical management of overweight/obese adults. </li>
    <li>While the evidence-based nutrition practice guideline represents a statement of promising practice based on the latest available evidence at the time of publication, the guideline is not intended to overrule professional judgment. Rather, it may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. The independent skill and judgment of the health care provider must always dictate treatment decisions. These nutrition practice guidelines are provided with the express understanding that they do not establish or specify particular standards of care, whether legal, medical or other. </li>
    <li>This guideline recognizes the role of patient and family preferences for possible outcomes of care, when the appropriateness of a clinical intervention involves a substantial element of personal choice or values. With regard to types of evidence that are associated with particular outcomes, two major classes have been described. Patient-oriented evidence that matters (POEM) deals with outcomes of importance to patients, such as changes in morbidity, mortality or quality of life. Disease-oriented evidence (DOE) deals with surrogate end-points, such as changes in laboratory values or other measures of response. Although the results of DOE sometimes parallel the results of POEM, they do not always correspond. When possible, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends using POEM-type evidence rather than DOE. When DOE is the only guidance available, the guideline indicates that key clinical recommendations lack the support of outcomes evidence. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The publication of this guideline is an integral part of supporting registered dietitian nutritionists in engaging with, teaching about, and researching this topic. National implementation workshops at various sites around the country and during the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Food Nutrition Conference Expo (FNCE) are planned. Additionally, there are recommended dissemination and adoption strategies for local use of the <em>Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Adult Weight Management Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guideline</em>.</p>
<p>The guideline development team recommended multi-faceted strategies to disseminate the guideline and encourage its implementation. Management support and learning through social influence are likely to be effective in implementing guidelines in dietetic practice. However, additional interventions may be needed to achieve real change in practice routines.</p>
<p>Implementation of the guideline will be achieved by announcement at professional events, presentations and training. Some strategies include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><strong>National and local events</strong>: State dietetic association meetings and media coverage will help launch the guideline. </li>
    <li><strong>Local feedback adaptation</strong>: Presentation by members of the work group at peer review meetings and opportunities for continuing education units (CEUs) for courses completed. </li>
    <li><strong>Education initiatives</strong>: The guideline and supplementary resources will be freely available for use in the education and training of dietetic interns and students in approved Commission on Accreditation of Dietetics Education (CADE) programs. </li>
    <li><strong>Champions</strong>: Local champions have been identified and expert members of the recommendation team will prepare articles for publications. Resources will be provided that include PowerPoint presentations and pre-prepared case studies. </li>
    <li><strong>Practical tools</strong>: Some of the tools that will be developed to help implement the guideline include specially designed resources such as clinical algorithms, slide presentations, training and toolkits. </li>
</ul>
<p>Specific distribution strategies include:</p>
<p><strong>Publication in full</strong>: The guideline is available electronically at the <a href="http://www.andeal.org/default.cfm?" title="AND Evidence Analysis Library Web site">Academy Evidence Analysis Library Web site</a> and announced to all Academy Dietetic Practice Groups. The Academy's Evidence Analysis Library will also provide downloadable supporting information and links to relevant position papers.</p></div>
