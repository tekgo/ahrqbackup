<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease, affecting an estimated 5 million children. Overall, approximately 20 million people in the United States (U.S.) have asthma (National Institutes of Health [NIH] &amp; National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute [NHLBI], 2003). Collectively, people with asthma have more than 100 million days of restricted activity and 5,000 deaths annually. Much of the death and morbidity associated with asthma is avoidable. Successful management of asthma can be achieved for most asthmatics if they take medication that provide long-term control.</p>
<p>Asthma-related suffering, cost and death can be greatly reduced through effective treatment with long-term controller medications. In addition, patient education regarding medication use, symptom management and avoidance of asthma attack triggers can greatly reduce the impact of the disease.</p>
<p>This process measure evaluates whether members 5 to 64 years of age with persistent asthma are being prescribed medications acceptable as primary therapy for long-term asthma control. The list of acceptable medications is derived from the NHLBI's National Asthma Education Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines (NAEPP, 1997).</p></div>

Once NCQA establishes national benchmarks for accountable care organization (ACO) performance, all measures will undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomiol statistical analysis. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test.</p></div>
