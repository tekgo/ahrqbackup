<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of individuals 65 years of age and older who received two or more prescription fills for any benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic for a cumulative period of more than 90 days.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Beers Criteria are the basis for the medication list in the measure High Risk Medications (HRM) in the Elderly and Drugs to Avoid in the Elderly (DAE). Since the measures only use prescription claims data for calculation, the lists are adapted from the Beers Criteria. Benzodiazepines were not included in the HRM/DAE measures since they are listed as "avoid only for treatment of insomnia, agitation or delirium."</p>
<p>This measure addresses a gap in the HRM/DAE measures that may have the unintended consequence of increasing the use of benzodiazepines for the very diagnoses the Beers Criteria state should be avoided. This measure parallels the HRM/DAE measures using the same criteria for benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agents as the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in the HRM/DAE.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure was pilot tested during measure development (see process below), which included reliability and validity testing.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) Measure Development Process</strong></p>
<p>PQA develops performance measures through a consensus-driven process to draft, test, refine and endorse measures of medication-use quality. </p>
<p>Step 1: PQA workgroups comprised of experts in all phases of drug use and management identify measure concepts that may be appropriate for development into fully specified performance measures or indicators for organizational internal quality improvement. The workgroups focus on specific aspects of the medication-use system and/or specific therapeutic areas. </p>
<p>Step 2: PQA workgroups recommend measure concepts to the PQA Quality Metrics Expert Panel (QMEP) for evaluation and refinement. The QMEP reviews the measure concepts to provide an initial assessment of the key properties of performance measures (i.e., feasibility, usability and scientific validity). The measure concepts that are rated highly on these key properties will undergo technical specification as draft measures. </p>
<p>Step 3: The draft measures are provided to PQA member organizations for their comments prior to preparing technical specifications for pilot testing. PQA staff use member comments and workgroup and QMEP recommendations to formulate a testing plan for each draft measure. </p>
<p>Step 4: PQA selects partners to test the draft measures. These partners are often PQA member health plans or academic institutions with expertise in quality and performance measure testing. The testing partner implements the draft technical specifications within their existing datasets and provides a report to PQA that details testing results and recommendations for modifications of the technical specifications. </p>
<p>Step 5: The workgroup that developed the measure reviews the testing results and provides comment. The QMEP reviews the workgroup comments, testing results, recommendations and potential modifications and provides a final assessment of the feasibility and scientific validity of the draft performance measures. </p>
<p>Step 6: Measures that are recommended by the QMEP for endorsement are posted on the PQA web site for member review, written comments are requested, and a conference call for member organizations is held to gather feedback and address any questions. This process allows members to discuss their views on the measures in advance of the voting period. </p>
<p>Step 7: PQA member organizations vote on endorsement of the Performance Measures and approval of Quality Improvement Indicators. </p></div>

For example, if a patient received a 30 day supply of triazolam and a second fill for 30 days supply of triazolam and then a fill for 35 days supply estazolam (all during the measurement period), this would qualify for inclusion in the numerator. </li>
