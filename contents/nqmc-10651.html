<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The purpose of quality measurement is to improve quality, inform consumers, reduce risk to patients and influence payment. At this time, the goal is to develop measure concepts that are indicative of potential improvements in or to our healthcare system so that evidence-based patient care can be provided and patient outcomes can be achieved, in consideration of costs and, ultimately, value. </p>
<p>Towards this end, the Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) proposes 3 measures related to opioid use that are indicative of the quality of care for these medications. PQA proposes these measures to examine the quality of use related to the dose of the medications over time, access to the medications and the combination of both of these criteria. </p>
<p>Claims data from commercially insured patients indicate that approximately 8% of opioid prescriptions for acute pain and 12% for chronic pain specify a daily dosage of 120 morphine equivalent dose (MED) or more (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2014). The proportion of patients being treated at this dosage for more than 90 days has not been described. However, one study of veterans treated with 180 MED/day or more for 90+ days (Liu et al., 2013) found that this group was characterized by high rates of psychiatric and substance abuse disorders and frequently did not receive care consistent with clinical guidelines. Other studies have suggested the people at high opioid dosage are at greater risk of overdoses and fractures (Morasco et al., 2010; Washington State Agency Medical Directors Group, 2010; Dunn et al., 2010). The Washington State Agency Medical Directors Group has suggested 120 MED as a dosage level that should not be exceeded without special consideration (Paulozzi et al., 2012). </p>
<p>Prescription drug monitoring programs, which track the use of multiple providers by patients, indicate that such use is typically found among a small proportion of patients, with the proportion declining as the number of providers increases. In Massachusetts in 2006, considering only Schedule II opioids, 0.5% of patients saw 4+ prescribers and 4+ pharmacies (Saunders et al., 2010). A national study found that 13% of patients had overlapping prescriptions from two or more different prescribers during an 18-month period. Of these, 0.5% used 4+ prescribers and 4+ pharmacies (Katz et al., 2010). People who see multiple prescribers or use multiple pharmacies are more likely to die of drug overdoses (Washington State Agency Medical Directors Group, 2010). Data from the California Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) indicates that people with higher daily dosages are more likely to see multiple prescribers or go to multiple pharmacies (Cepeda et al., 2012). </p>
<p>The data above suggest that prevention of opioid overdose deaths should focus on strategies that target (1) high-dose opioid users as well as (2) persons who seek care from multiple doctors and pharmacies. The data suggest that these criteria can be considered separately, as measures related to prescribed opioids for legitimate uses versus diverted uses. Thus, PQA proposes 3 measures: one for each criteria (see the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse [NQMC] measure summary of the PQA measure <a href="/content.aspx?id=49882" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Use of opioids from multiple providers or at high dosage in persons without cancer: the proportion of individuals without cancer receiving prescriptions for opioids with a daily dosage greater than 120 mg morphine equivalent dose (MED) for 90 consecutive days or longer</a>) and one that is the intersection of both criteria (see the related NQMC measure summary of the PQA measure <a href="/content.aspx?id=49884" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Use of opioids from multiple providers or at high dosage in persons without cancer: the proportion of individuals without cancer receiving prescriptions for opioids with a daily dosage greater than 120 mg morphine equivalent dose (MED) for 90 consecutive days or longer, AND who received opioid prescriptions from four (4) or more prescribers AND four (4) or more pharmacies</a>). This approach will also assist health plans in managing the number of patients who meet the measure criteria and planning their respective interventions, so that a balance of identification and intervention can be determined.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure was pilot tested during measure development (see process below), which included reliability testing. </p>
<p><strong>Process for Development and Testing of Performance Measures</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA) workgroups identify measure concepts that may be appropriate for development into fully specified performance measures. The workgroups focus on specific aspects of the medication-use system and/or specific therapeutic areas. The workgroups are open to all members of PQA and use a consensus-based approach to identify, prioritize and recommend the measure concepts that are deemed to be highly important for supporting quality improvement related to medications. </p>
<p>Step 2: The measure concepts that are recommended for further development through a vote by the PQA workgroups are forwarded to the PQA Quality Metrics Expert Panel (QMEP) for evaluation and refinement. The QMEP reviews the measure concepts to provide an initial assessment of the key properties of performance measures (i.e., feasibility, usability and scientific validity). The measure concepts that are rated highly on these key properties will then undergo technical specification. </p>
<p>Step 3: The draft measure is provided to PQA member organizations for their comments prior to preparing technical specifications for pilot testing. The QMEP reviews member comments, edits the draft measure accordingly and poses testing questions based on this all-member feedback. </p>
<p>Step 4: PQA selects partners to test the draft measure. These partners are often PQA member health plans or academic institutions with expertise in quality and performance measure testing. The testing partner implements the draft technical specifications with their existing datasets and provides a report to PQA that details testing results and recommendations for modifications of the technical specifications. </p>
<p>Step 5: The workgroup that developed the measure reviews the testing results and provides comment. The QMEP reviews the workgroup comments, testing results, recommendations and potential modifications and provides a final assessment of the feasibility and scientific validity of the draft performance measures. </p>
<p>Step 6: Measures that are recommended by the QMEP for endorsement are posted on the PQA Web site for member review, written comments are requested, and a conference call for member organizations is scheduled to address any questions. This process allows members to discuss their views on the measures in advance of the voting period. </p>
<p>Step 7: PQA member organizations vote on the performance measure(s) considered for endorsement.</p></div>
