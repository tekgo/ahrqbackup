Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of deliveries between November 6 of the year prior to the measurement year and November 5 of the measurement year that had a postpartum visit on or between 21 and 56 days after delivery.</p>
<p>This measure is a component of a composite measure; it can also be used on its own. See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summary of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measure <a href="/content.aspx?id=49779" title="Measure Summary" target="_blank">Timeliness of prenatal care: percentage of deliveries that received a prenatal care visit as a member of the organization in the first trimester or within 42 days of enrollment in the organization</a>.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Administrative and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Administrative Specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid Specification. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] &amp; ACOG, 2002) recommends that women see their health care provider at least once between 4 and 6 weeks after giving birth. The first postpartum visit should include a physical examination and is an opportunity for the health care practitioner to answer parents' questions, and give family planning guidance and counsel on nutrition.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although many women experience uncomplicated pregnancies, timely and adequate prenatal care can prevent poor birth outcomes (Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2012). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (2012) recommend that a woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy be examined every 4 weeks for the first 28 weeks of pregnancy, every 2 to 3 weeks until 36 weeks of gestation and weekly thereafter. </li>
    <li>Appropriate perinatal services and education are crucial components of a healthy birth. Understanding how to stay healthy is important for preventing complications that can affect the health of both mother and baby before, during and after pregnancy. </li>
</ul>
