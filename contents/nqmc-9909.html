<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The measure will promote adherence to existing clinical practice guidelines on influenza immunization in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population and will consequently reduce patient complication, hospitalization, and mortality rates. </p>
<p>As noted in the most recent guidelines released by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and older, and is particularly important for individuals at increased risk for severe complications from influenza&ndash;including patients with ESRD (Grohskopf et al., 2014; Committee on Infectious Diseases &amp; AAP, 2014). The body of evidence upon which these guidelines and this measure are based indicate that infectious disease is the second leading cause of death among ESRD patients and that pulmonary infectious mortality is tenfold higher in the ESRD population than in the general population (Gilbertson et al., 2003; Sarnak &amp; Jaber, 2001; Thompson et al., 2004; Poehling et al., 2006; Izurieta et al., 2000). Especially among the young (Poehling et al., 2006; Izurieta et al., 2000), the aged (Gross et al., 1995; Nichol et al., 1999; Nichol et al., 1994; Nichol et al., 1998; Foster et al., 1992), and those with increased comorbidity (Nichol et al., 1999; Nichol et al., 1994; Nichol et al., 1998; Foster et al., 1992), influenza vaccination has been demonstrated to be a safe and efficacious means of decreasing the likelihood of hospitalization and mortality and reduces healthcare costs (Nichol et al., 1999; Nichol et al., 1994; Nichol et al., 1998; Foster et al., 1992; Arguedas, Solet, &amp; Lindert, 2010; Plennevaux et al., 2010; Scharp&eacute; et al., 2008; Edvardsson et al., 1996). A goal of the "Healthy People 2010" program was to immunize 90% of the elderly and other high-risk individuals against influenza (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2000; "Influenza and pneumococcal," 2001). Yet despite this and well-established recommendations for annual vaccination in patients with ESRD ("Prevention and control," 1998), less than 66 percent of all ESRD patients received the influenza vaccination in 2010 (U.S. Renal Dialysis System [USRDS], 2015). The pediatric ESRD population vaccination rate remains very low, with only approximately 37% of all ESRD patients under the age of 19 receiving the vaccine in 2010 (USRDS, 2015). Note: The goal for influenza immunization of the elderly and other high-risk individuals for "Healthy People 2020" is unchanged from the 2010 goal at 90% (DHHS, 2010).</p>
<p>These findings strongly support existing clinical practice guidelines and the underlying construct of the Kidney Care Quality Alliance (KCQA) Influenza Immunization Measure&ndash;i.e., to reduce the frequency of infectious complications and improve patient survival, all ESRD patients should be immunized annually against influenza, absent a documented medical contraindication.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Testing Protocol</strong><br />
The Kidney Care Quality Alliance (KCQA) undertook testing of its end stage renal disease (ESRD) measures through a prospective cohort study at a nationally drawn sample of 53 dialysis facilities containing a mix of for-profit and not-for-profit providers; hospital-affiliated and freestanding facilities within large, small, and independent dialysis organizations; urban, suburban, and rural settings; and facilities both with and without electronic health records (EHRs). Approximately 25 patients per facility were sought, resulting in a final sample size of 1,115 patients. Both facility and patient samples were structured to be generally representative of the national industry profile as identified by the United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) 2007 Annual Data Report. Facility records were used as the data source, and standardized, paper-based data collection sheets constructed from the endorsed specifications were employed during data collection (see the "Companion Documents" field for the data collection form). </p>
<p>Following the year-long data collection period, on-site data-integrity audits were performed at 11 of the 53 facilities (21%). Audit sites were selected to provide a cross-section of facilities reflective of the sample profile. Selection criteria included geographic location, facility type (e.g., for-profit vs. not-for-profit, urban vs. rural), and EHR use. Pertinent data were reabstracted from the patients' medical records and were compared to the information submitted by the facility throughout the pilot to assess the measure's reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Influenza Immunization Testing Results</strong><br />
<em>Performance</em>: Influenza vaccination data were provided for 1,104 of the 1,115 patients (99.0%) in the study sample. The performance rate for the measure was calculated as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Performance rate</strong> =</p>
<p class="Center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"># Pts Vaccinated + # Pts Who Decline Vaccine + # Pts with Medical Contraindication</span><br />
ESRD Pts Aged 18 Years and Older</p>
<p class="Center">= (958 + 120 + 5) / 1,115 = <strong>97.1%</strong>*​​​</p>
<p><em>Reliability</em>: Inter-rater reliability was assessed during the on-site data integrity audits through a direct comparison of data submitted by the facilities throughout the pilot to data reabstracted by the auditor(s), and was quantitatively summarized using Cohen's Kappa with confidence intervals. The resulting Kappa statistic was found to be 0.6568 with a confidence interval of 0.5210 to 0.7926. Based on the literature, this value indicates "substantial" agreement and excellent reproducibility for the measure. In addition to the Kappa value, the percent agreement between the auditor and facility abstractors (i.e., the reliability percentage) was calculated and was found to be excellent at 98.1%. These two values demonstrate that the KCQA Influenza Immunization measure is reliable.</p>
<p class="Note">*Despite the high overall performance rate, performance for each individual facility ranged from 78% to 100%, demonstrating a performance gap.</p></div>
