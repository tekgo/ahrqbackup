<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes. It is recommended that the intervention be provided selectively on the basis of professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&ndash;There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&ndash;It is recommended that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Criteria for level of evidence and recommendations (A, B, C, I, D) are based on standard language from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016). Suggested recommendations are based on the available evidence and content experts' clinical expertise regarding the value of using such evidence.</p>

Guideline Objective(s)
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>To provide an overview of occupational therapy interventions for people with major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) on the basis of existing evidence of the effects of various interventions </li>
    <li>To help guide future decisions for research by highlighting areas in which promising interventions lack enough evidence of a clear benefit or in which available interventions fail to meet specific needs of clients with major NCD </li>
    <li>To be useful to many involved in providing services to people with major NCD, such as occupational therapy practitioners and educators, team members, clients, families, caregivers, third party payers, and policymakers </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Three focused questions framed the review of occupational therapy interventions for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs). </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What is the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions designed to establish, modify, and maintain occupations (activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, leisure, and social participation) for people with AD and related major NCDs? </li>
    <li>What is the evidence for the effectiveness of environment-based interventions on behavior, perception, and falls in both the home and other settings (e.g., long-term care, assisted living) for people with AD and related major NCDs? </li>
    <li>What is the evidence for the effectiveness of educational and supportive strategies for caregivers of people with AD and related major NCDs on the ability to maintain participation in that role? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methodology</span></strong></p>
<p>Search terms for the reviews were developed by the methodology consultant to the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Project and AOTA staff, in consultation with the review authors of each question, and by the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to make sure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. The original search strategy for the focused questions on AD and related major NCDs was used for the updated review. Additional search terms were added to ensure maximum coverage of those questions. </p>
<p>Table F.1 in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to population (AD and related major NCDs) and types of interventions included in each systematic review. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted all searches and confirmed and improved the search strategies. </p>
<p>Databases and sites searched included MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and OTseeker. In addition, consolidated information sources, such as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were included in the search. These databases are peer-reviewed summaries of journal articles and provide a system for clinicians and scientists to conduct systematic reviews of selected clinical questions and topics. Moreover, reference lists from articles included in the systematic reviews were examined for potential articles, and selected journals were hand searched to ensure that all appropriate articles were included. </p>
<p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria are critical to the systematic review process because they provide the structure for the quality, type, and years of publication of the literature that is incorporated into a review. The review of all three questions was limited to peer-reviewed scientific literature published in English. The intervention approaches examined were within the scope of practice of occupational therapy. The literature included in the review was published between 2006 and April 2014 and included study participants with AD and related major NCDs. The review excluded data from presentations, conference proceedings, non&ndash;peer-reviewed research literature, dissertations, and theses. Studies included in the review are Level I, II, and III evidence. Level IV and V evidence was included only when higher level evidence on a given topic was not found. </p>
<p>A total of 6,927 citations and abstracts were included in the reviews. For the question on occupation-based interventions, there were 2,597 references; for the question on environment-based interventions, there were 1,854 references; and for the caregiver question, there were 2,476 references. The consultant to the EBP Project completed the first step of eliminating references on the basis of citation and abstract. The systematic reviews were carried out as academic partnerships in which academic faculty worked either as faculty pairs or with graduate students. Review teams completed the next step of eliminating references on the basis of citations and abstracts. The full-text versions of potential articles were retrieved, and the review teams determined final inclusion in the review on the basis of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></div>

Each article included in the review was then abstracted using an evidence table that provides a summary of the methods and findings of each article. American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) staff and the Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Project consultant reviewed the evidence tables to ensure quality control. All studies are summarized in full in the evidence tables in Appendix G in the original guideline document. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the methods described by Higgins, Altman, and Sterne (2011). The method for assessing the risk of bias of systematic reviews was based on the measurement tool developed by Shea et al. (2007). Risk of Bias tables are included in Appendix G in the original guideline document. </p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A major focus of the American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc. (AOTA's) Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) projects is an ongoing program of systematic review of the multidisciplinary scientific literature, using focused questions and standardized procedures to identify occupational therapy&ndash;relevant evidence and discuss its implications for practice, education, and research. An evidence-based perspective is founded on the assumption that scientific evidence of the effectiveness of occupational therapy intervention can be judged to be more or less strong and valid according to a hierarchy of research designs, an assessment of the quality of the research, or both. </p>
<p>AOTA uses standards of evidence modeled on those developed in evidence-based medicine. This model standardizes and ranks the value of scientific evidence for biomedical practice using a grading system presented in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field. In this system, the highest level of evidence, Level I, includes systematic reviews of the literature, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In RCTs, participants are randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group, and the outcomes of both groups are compared. Other levels of evidence include Level II studies, in which assignment to a treatment or a control group is not randomized (cohort study); Level III studies, which do not have a control group; Level IV studies, which use a single-case experimental design, sometimes reported over several participants; and Level V studies, which are case reports and expert opinions that include narrative literature reviews and consensus statements.</p>
<p>The systematic reviews on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) were supported by AOTA as part of the EBP Project. AOTA is committed to supporting the role of occupational therapy in this important area of practice. This guideline was commissioned, edited and endorsed by AOTA without external funding being sought or obtained. The report was entirely supported financially by AOTA and was developed without any involvement of industry. A previous review covered the time frame of 1994&ndash;2005. The current systematic reviews were updated for the period 2006&ndash;April 2014. These reviews are crucial because occupational therapy practitioners need access to the results of the latest and best available literature to support intervention for people with AD and related major NCDs within the scope of occupational therapy practice.</p>
<p>Three focused questions framed the review of occupational therapy interventions for people with AD and related major NCDs. These questions were reviewed by the review authors, an advisory group of experts in the field (occupational therapists and an applied research sociologist), AOTA staff, and the methodology consultant to the AOTA EBP Project.</p></div>

Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes. It is recommended that the intervention be provided selectively on the basis of professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&ndash;There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&ndash;It is recommended that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Criteria for level of evidence and recommendations (A, B, C, I, D) are based on standard language from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016). Suggested recommendations are based on the available evidence and content experts' clinical expertise regarding the value of using such evidence.</p></div>
