Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the number of patients diagnosed with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) during hospitalization (not present at admission) who did not receive VTE prophylaxis between hospital admission and the day before the VTE diagnosis testing order date.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The concept of "failure to prevent" has generated interest in national health policy organizations to identify evidence-based practice that will improve patient safety in the hospital setting (Shojania et al., 2001). The incidence of preventable venous thromboembolism (VTE) among hospitalized patients is overwhelming, and contributes to extended hospital stays, and the rising cost of health care. Zhan and Miller (2003) states that "VTE was the second most common medical complication of postoperative patients, the second most common cause of excess length of stay, and the third most common cause of excess mortality and excess charges." According to Arnold, Khan, and Shrier&nbsp;(2001), preventable VTE is defined as "objectively diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary emboli (PE) that occurred in a setting in which thromboprophylaxis was indicated but was either administered inadequately or not administered at all." In spite of formal guidelines, and recommendations for preventative care, pulmonary embolism is still the most common preventable cause of death among hospitalized patients (Shojania et al., 2001).</p></div>
