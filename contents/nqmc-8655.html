<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all persons six months of age and older, including healthcare personnel (HCP) and persons in training for healthcare professions, should be vaccinated annually against influenza. Persons who are infected with influenza virus, including those who are pre-symptomatic, can transmit the virus to coworkers and patients, including those at higher risk for complications from influenza. Vaccination of working age adults, including HCP, has been associated with reduced risk of influenza illness, and reduced work absenteeism, antibiotic use, and medical visits. In addition, HCP vaccination has been found to reduce deaths among nursing home patients and elderly hospitalized patients. Although annual vaccination is recommended for all HCP and is a high priority for reducing morbidity associated with influenza in healthcare settings, national survey data have demonstrated that vaccination coverage levels are only approximately 60%. This is well below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 90% for HCP influenza vaccination. </p>
<p>Healthcare facilities should provide influenza vaccine to HCP using approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in increasing vaccination coverage. Healthcare administrators should consider the level of vaccination coverage among HCP to be one measure of a patient safety quality program and consider obtaining signed declinations from personnel who decline influenza vaccination for reasons other than medical contraindications. Influenza vaccination rates (including ward-, unit-, and specialty-specific coverage rates) among HCP within facilities should be regularly measured and reported to facility administrators and staff.</p>
<p>Healthcare facilities should offer influenza vaccinations to all HCP, including night, weekend, and temporary staff. Efforts should be made to educate HCP regarding the benefits of vaccination and the potential health consequences of influenza illness for their patients, themselves, and their family members. Studies have demonstrated that organized campaigns can attain higher rates of vaccination among HCP with moderate effort and by using strategies that increase vaccine acceptance. All HCP should be provided convenient access to influenza vaccine at the work site, free of charge.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Reliability was assessed by comparing agreement between facility staff and project staff on the classification of healthcare personnel (HCP) numerator (vaccinated at facility, vaccinated elsewhere, contraindicated, declined) and denominator (employees, credentialed nonemployees, other nonemployees) categories. To assess validity, facility staff completed a series of case studies to evaluate how closely classification of HCP groups aligned with the measure's specifications. In a modified Delphi process, experts rated face validity of the proposed measure elements on a Likert-type scale. </p>
<p>Participants were staff from 96 healthcare facilities (including acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, physician practices, and dialysis centers from 3 U.S. jurisdictions) randomly sampled from 234 facilities that completed pilot testing to assess the feasibility of the measure. </p>
<p>Percent agreement was high for HCP vaccinated at the facility (99%) and elsewhere (95%) and was lower for HCP who declined vaccination (64%) or were medically contraindicated (64%). While agreement was high (more than 90%) for all denominator categories, many facilities' staff excluded nonemployees for whom numerator and denominator status was difficult to determine. Validity was lowest for credentialed and other nonemployees. </p>
<p>The standardized measure of HCP influenza vaccination yields reproducible results for employees vaccinated at the facility and elsewhere. Adhering to true medical contraindications and tracking declinations should improve reliability. Difficulties in establishing denominators and determining vaccination status for credentialed and other nonemployees challenged the measure's validity and prompted revision to include a more limited group of nonemployees.</p></div>

Post-residency fellows are also included in this category if they are not on the facility's payroll. </li>
    <li>Adult students/trainees and volunteers: This includes medical, nursing, or other health professional students, interns, medical residents, or volunteers aged 18 or older who are affiliated with the healthcare facility, but are not directly employed by it (i.e., they do not receive a paycheck from the facility), regardless of clinical responsibility or patient contact. </li>
    <li>Other contract personnel (optional): Facilities may also report on individuals who are contract personnel. However, reporting for this category is optional at this time. Contract personnel are defined as persons providing care, treatment, or services at the facility through a contract who do not fall into any of the above-mentioned denominator categories.

Work for any number of hours a day counts as one working day. </li>
    <li>Both full-time and part-time personnel should be included. HCP should be counted as individuals rather than full-time equivalents. If a healthcare worker (HCW) works in two or more facilities, each facility should include the HCW in their denominator. </li>

    <li>The numerator data are mutually exclusive. The sum of the numerator categories should be equal to the denominator for each HCP group. </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note">*For the purposes of this measure, a medical contraindication to vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) is defined as having a severe allergic reaction to eggs or other components of the influenza vaccine or a history of GBS within 6 weeks after a previous influenza vaccination. A healthcare facility may grant medical exemptions to HCP with other conditions besides those defined by the measure and may include these conditions in its list of acceptable medical contraindications to influenza vaccination. However, to ensure that data are comparable across different facilities reporting data using this measure, only those HCP with one of the two conditions stated above should be reported to NHSN as having a medical contraindication to influenza vaccination. </p>
<p class="Note">For this measure, vaccination with LAIV4 is medically contraindicated for the following groups: persons aged greater than 49 years; persons who have experienced severe allergic reactions to the vaccine or any of its components, or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine; pregnant women; immunosuppressed persons; persons with a history of egg allergy; and persons who have taken influenza antiviral medications within the previous 48 hours. In addition to the groups for whom LAIV is not recommended, the following conditions are precautions for the use of LAIV: chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular (except isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) and asthma. Persons who care for severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protective environment should not receive LAIV, or should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after receipt, given the theoretical risk for transmission of the live attenuated vaccine virus. HCP who have a medical contraindication to LAIV other than a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or history of Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome within 6 weeks after a previous influenza vaccination, should be offered inactivated influenza vaccine by their facility, if available. Contraindications to LAIV4 other than a severe allergic reaction after a previous vaccine dose or to a vaccine component, including egg protein, and history of Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome within 6 weeks after a previous influenza vaccination are not acceptable medical contraindications for this measure.</p>
