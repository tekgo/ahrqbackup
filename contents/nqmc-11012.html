<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Support (verbatim) from National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines</em>:<br />
In all cases, the most important first step is to make an accurate pathologic diagnosis. The basic pathological evaluation is the same in each guideline though some further evaluation may be useful in certain circumstances to clarify a particular diagnosis.</p>
<p>An incisional or excisional lymph node biopsy is recommended to establish the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Core needle biopsy is discouraged unless the clinical situation dictates that this is the only safe means of obtaining diagnostic tissue. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is widely used in the diagnosis of malignant neoplasms, but its role in the diagnosis of lymphoma is still controversial. Since the revised Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL)/World Health Organization (WHO) classification is based on both morphology and immunophenotyping, FNA alone is not acceptable as a reliable diagnostic tool for NHL. However, its use in combination with ancillary techniques may provide precise diagnosis thereby obviating the need for a more invasive biopsy in highly selected circumstances. Recent studies have shown that the diagnostic accuracy of FNA improves significantly when it is used in combination with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry. </p>
<p>In the NCCN guidelines, FNA alone is not suitable for an initial diagnosis of NHL. However, in certain circumstances, when a lymph node is not easily accessible, a combination of core biopsy and FNA in conjunction with appropriate ancillary techniques (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] for immunoglobulin heavy chain variable [IgHV] and/or T-cell receptor [TCR] gene rearrangements; fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] for major translocations [at least one positive result (rearrangement) consistent with a lymphoid neoplasm (addition from American Society of Hematology [ASH] Lymphoma Task Force)]; immunophenotypic analysis) may be sufficient for diagnosis. In other entities presenting in leukemic phase, such as follicular lymphoma (FL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a biopsy is still preferred to clarify histological subtype (NCCN, 2015).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Statement (verbatim) from research literature on gap</em>:<br />
From the perspective of a clinician attempting to design a treatment plan for patients with lymphoma, we found fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to be woefully inadequate. In 67 patients with both FNA and excisional biopsy done at the time of initial diagnosis, we found 12% concordance. An additional 21% were correctly diagnosed using the broader term of lymphoma, without further histologic subtyping. We consider this group as having an inadequate diagnosis for management. Therefore, 88% of patients were given FNA cytology diagnoses that were clinically inadequate on which to base treatment decisions. More worrisome is our finding that 15% were given a wrong diagnosis (a specific but incorrect histologic subtype). </p>
<p>Those FNAs evaluated with immunophenotyping, in addition to morphology, had a significantly better correlation with excisional biopsy than those FNAs evaluated alone (29% v 2%, respectively; <em>P</em>=.002). Although emphasis is placed on the importance of ancillary techniques, these additional tests were used less than 50% of the time by pathologists in our review. For the initial diagnosis of lymphoma, ancillary techniques were used 41% of the time (Hehn, Grogan, &amp; Miller, 2004). </p>
<p><em>Statement from American Society of Hematology (ASH) Lymphoma Task Force on gap</em>:<br />
This measure has been in use for the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification Performance Improvement Module since July 2013. Performance over the first 10 months (through May 2014) among this highly select group of hematologists is 93%. We believe performance among all hematologists would be somewhat lower. Since accurate diagnosis and staging are the foundation for all treatment, we suggest this gap remains significant.</p></div>
