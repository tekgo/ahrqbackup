Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence-Based, Formal Consensus, Informal Consensus, No Recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Endocrine therapy, rather than chemotherapy, should be offered as the standard first-line treatment for patients with hormone receptor&ndash;positive advanced/metastatic breast cancer, except for immediately life threatening disease or if there is concern regarding endocrine resistance.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The main benefit is less toxicity and better quality of life for the patient associated with endocrine therapy compared with chemotherapy (potential benefit: high). The harm is that metastatic disease could progress rapidly and prove fatal if there is no response, but the risk of this is low (potential harm: low). </li>
        <li>The quality of the evidence is intermediate, and is based on the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer (NCCC) systematic review. </li>
        <li>The strength of this recommendation is strong and is supported by the evidence and expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: It should be noted that the basis for this recommendation is the relative likelihood of response to chemotherapy versus endocrine therapy and not the rapidity of response, for which there are no good data.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>Sequential single-agent chemotherapy rather than combination therapy should be offered, although combination regimens may be considered for immediately life-threatening disease for which time may allow only one potential chance for therapy.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The benefit is less toxicity and better quality of life (potential benefit: high). The potential harm is for rapidly progressing, life-threatening disease to escape control if response to a single agent isn't achieved (potential harm: high). The main benefit is there is less toxicity and better quality of life for the patient associated with sequential single agent chemotherapy compared with combination chemotherapy (potential benefit: high). The harm is that metastatic disease could progress rapidly if there is no response, but the risk of this is low (potential harm: low). </li>
        <li>The evidence quality is high, and includes a large randomized controlled trial (RCT). </li>
        <li>The strength of this recommendation is strong. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>With regard to targeted agents, the role of bevacizumab is controversial, and this therapy should be considered (where available) with single-agent chemotherapy only when there is immediately life-threatening disease or severe symptoms, in view of improved response rates (similar to Recommendation 2 regarding the use of combination chemotherapy). It is recognized that there is not currently an approved indication for bevacizumab in the United States because the weight of evidence shows no significant survival benefit. Other targeted agents should not be used either in addition to, or as a replacement for, chemotherapy in this setting outside of a trial.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The benefit is improved disease control (potential benefit: moderate). The potential harms are unique toxicity, increased costs, and barriers to access (potential harm: high). </li>
        <li>The quality of the evidence is high and is supported by multiple trials. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is moderate and is based on both evidence and expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: Bevacizumab added to single-agent chemotherapy improves response and progression-free survival but not overall survival.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>No single agent has demonstrated superiority in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer, and there are several active agents appropriate for first-line chemotherapy. The evidence for efficacy is strongest for taxanes and anthracyclines. Other options include capecitabine, gemcitabine, platinum-based compounds, vinorelbine, and ixabepilone. Treatment selection should be based on previous therapy, differential toxicity, comorbid conditions, and patient preferences. Specifically, drugs for which clinical resistance has already been shown should not be reused.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The benefit is a patient-tailored approach with potential improvements in disease control and quality of life (potential benefit: high). The harm is the potential use of a less active agent (potential harm: low). </li>
        <li>The evidence quality supporting the activity of a number of single agents is high, but there is insufficient evidence to support superiority of any single agent. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is strong and is based on the available evidence and expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Chemotherapy should be continued until progression of disease as tolerated because it modestly improves overall survival and substantially improves progression-free survival, but this has to be balanced against toxicity and quality of life. Short breaks, flexibility in scheduling, or a switch to endocrine therapy (in patients with hormone receptor&ndash;positive disease) may be offered to selected patients.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The benefits are more time before disease-progression and modestly improved survival (potential benefit: high). The harm is more prolonged toxicity (potential harm: moderate). </li>
        <li>The evidence quality is high, and is based on a systematic review with meta-analysis. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is strong, and is supported by evidence and expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: It is recognized that the balance between continuing treatment to maintain disease control and coping with progressive adverse events (AEs) and/or toxicity is a difficult one. It will be influenced by many factors, including drug used (e.g., long-term use of capecitabine is relatively easy, whereas docetaxel is severely limited by cumulative toxicity) and requires a continuing dialogue between doctor and patient.</em></p>
    </li>
    <li>Chemotherapy regimens should not be specifically tailored to different breast cancer subtypes (e.g., triple negative, lobular) at the present time due to the absence of evidence proving differential efficacies. In addition, in vitro chemoresistance assays should not be used to select treatment.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The benefits are not omitting potentially efficacious treatment and cost-saving on in vitro assays (potential benefit: high). </li>
        <li>Current evidence shows no convincing basis for either of these approaches. </li>
        <li>The strength of this recommendation is moderate, and is supported by expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: This recommendation will need to be modified if ongoing or future research addressing this important issue suggests benefits of tailoring.</em> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Second- and later-line therapy may be of clinical benefit and should be offered as determined by previous treatments, toxicity, coexisting medical conditions, and patient choice. As with first-line treatment, no clear evidence exists for the superiority of one specific drug or regimen. Active agents include those active in first-line treatment.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The benefit is further chance of disease control and symptomatic improvement (potential benefit: high). The harm is toxicity (potential harm: high). </li>
        <li>The quality of the evidence ranges from high to low as reported in multiple randomized trials. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is strong and is based on expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: The most convincing data are for eribulin based on survival superiority against best standard treatment in a recent large RCT, but there is a lack of good comparative data between these various agents.</em> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Palliative care should be offered throughout the continuum of care. As there are diminishing returns with later lines of chemotherapy, clinicians should also offer best supportive care without further chemotherapy as an option.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The benefits include a patient-centered approach emphasizing quality of life (potential benefit: high). The main harm is fear of abandonment and giving up hope, which can be addressed by effective communication and appropriate end-of-life planning (potential harm: moderate). </li>
        <li>The quality of the evidence is intermediate and is supported by several RCTs in patients with advanced cancer. </li>
        <li>The strength of the recommendation is strong and is supported by evidence, expert consensus, and another independent expert consensus. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Qualifying statement: Evidence suggests that response to second and subsequent lines of chemotherapy is strongly influenced by response to earlier treatment; patients whose disease has failed to respond to up to two initial lines of treatment are less likely to respond to a third or subsequent line.</em> </p>
    </li>
    <li>As there is no cure yet for patients with advanced breast cancer, clinicians should encourage all eligible patients to enroll onto clinical trials. This should include the option of phase II and even targeted phase I trials before all standard lines of therapy have been used, in the absence of immediately life-threatening disease.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
        <li>The benefits are more patients will be directed to clinical studies providing treatment benefits to them, and the medical community will benefit from more research to improve treatments available and on which to base treatment decisions. The potential harm is patients will receive inferior treatment. </li>
        <li>There is no strong evidence to suggest this approach might impair outcome. </li>
        <li>The strength of this recommendation is strong and based on expert consensus. </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are based on systematic reviews of the literature. A protocol for each systematic review defines parameters for a targeted literature search. Additional parameters include relevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria for literature identified. The protocol for this guideline was reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee's Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG).</p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>For this clinical practice guideline (CPG), the recommendations were developed by an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation using a systematic review (January 2009 through to May 2013 for first-line trials; January 1993 through to May 2013 for second-line trials) of systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and clinical experience.</p>
<p><strong>Study Selection Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence on the basis of the following criteria:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Included women 18 years of age and older with&nbsp;human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (or unknown) advanced breast cancer </li>
    <li>Were fully published reports identified using the MEDLINE (OVID) database or abstracts from specific conference proceedings (San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium; 2011, 2012) and ASCO abstracts (2012, 2013) </li>
    <li>Included a minimum of 25 patients per study arm </li>

<p><strong>Study Quality</strong></p>
<p>Study quality was formally assessed for all 30 of the included first-line trials and for all 28 of the included second-line trials, with details available in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer and included factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, and so on. The risk of bias was assessed as low, intermediate, or high for most of the identified evidence. It was determined that this body of evidence represented trials of acceptable quality, and no exclusions were made on the basis of the assessment.</p></div>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, community oncology, patient representation, and guideline methodology. The Expert Panel members are listed in the Appendix in the original guideline document.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong></p>
<p>The Expert Panel, who met via teleconference and corresponded through email, were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations in consideration of the evidence. Members of the Expert Panel are responsible for drafting the penultimate version of guideline, which was then circulated for external review and submitted to the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO)</em> for editorial review and publication.</p>

<p>The recommendations were developed on the basis of systematic reviews of the scientific literature and expert panel consensus, using the best available evidence and clinical experience as guides. The recommendations are evidence based and informed by randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. Summary descriptions of results are provided in the literature review and analysis section of the original guideline document. Ratings for the type of recommendation and strength of the evidence are offered (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields).</p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, by using the Guidelines Into Decision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz software (see the Methodology Supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). A guideline implementability review was conducted to improve clarity around recommended actions for clinical practice.</p></div>

<p>The draft clinical practice guideline (CPG) was distributed to three clinicians who were not members of the Expert Panel for review (see the Acknowledgments section of the original guideline document). Main comments included: inclusion of several trials that were outside of the search dates for the systematic review, lack of availability of the targeted therapy agent in some areas, a request to change the language around the likelihood of finding an optimal therapy regimen that would address the needs of all patients, and other changes of an editorial nature.

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There are many agents available for the systemic treatment of breast cancer that may result in tumor response or stability; however, most antineoplastic agents are also associated with adverse events (AEs) that may impair quality of life (QoL) and even cause life-threatening toxicity. </li>
    <li>In one study there were no significant differences between the duration of overall survival (OS) between single-agent and combination arms, and the combination arm was associated with more severe adverse effects. Another pivotal trial reported as well, along with two follow-up articles, that single-agent sequential therapy is likely no different from combination regimens, although combination regimens are associated with greater, and more severe, AEs. </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Guideline Implementation</strong></p>
<p>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and cancer survivors, and to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the <a href="http://www.asco.org/" title="ASCO Web site">ASCO Web site</a> and most often published in <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> and <em>Journal of Oncology Practice</em>.</p>
