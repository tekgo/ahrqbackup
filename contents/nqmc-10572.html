<h2>Brief Abstract
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 12 months to 19 years of age who had a visit with a primary care practitioner (PCP). The organization reports four separate percentages for each product line:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Children 12 to 24 months and 25 months to 6 years who had a visit with a PCP during the measurement year </li>
    <li>Children 7 to 11 years and adolescents 12 to 19 years who had a visit with a PCP during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year </li>
</ul></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Without a patient visit, members do not receive counseling on diet, exercise, smoking cessation, seat belt use and behaviors that put them at risk. If the organization's services are not being used, are there barriers to access? Maintaining access to care requires more than making providers and services available&mdash;it involves analysis and systematic removal of barriers to care.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Access to primary care is important for the health and well-being of children and adolescents. High-quality primary care services have been found to significantly reduce children's nonurgent emergency room (ER) visits (Bloom et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>A recent national survey showed that almost 5 million children experienced a need for medical care in the last year but did not receive it. In the same survey, 2.3 million children were described as having "fair to poor" health (Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative [CAHMI], 2011). </li>
    <li>More than 7 million children do not have a personal doctor or nurse, and more than 6 million young people do not have a consistent place to receive care when they get sick (CAHMI, 2011). </li>
    <li>In 2011, 16 percent of children 6 to 17 years of age had one or more ER visits (National Center on Health Statistics [NCHS], 2012). </li>
    <li>A consistent source of primary care can fill the need for screening, appropriate treatment and preventive services for children and adolescents. </li>
</ul>
