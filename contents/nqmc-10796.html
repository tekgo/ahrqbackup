<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Health care-associated bacteremia is significant problem for infants admitted into neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and other hospital units. This is especially true for very low birth weight infants who are at high risk for these infections due to their immature immune systems and need for invasive monitoring and supportive care (Adams-Chapman &amp; Stoll, 2002; Bloom et al., 2003; Clark et al., "Prevention," 2004; Clark et al., "Nosocomial," 2004; Gaynes et al., 1996; Payne et al., 2004; Sohn et al., 2001; Stoll et al., 2002). Reported health care-associated infection rates range from 6% to 33%, but the rate varies widely among different centers (Adams-Chapman &amp; Stoll, 2002; Bloom et al., 2003; Clark et al., "Nosocomial," 2004; Sohn et al., 2001; Stoll et al., 2002). Mortality rates are high and infections result in increased length of stay as well as increased hospital costs and charges (Adams-Chapman &amp; Stoll, 2002; Bloom et al., 2003; Clark et al., "Nosocomial," 2004; Horbar et al., 2001; Killbride et al., "Implementation," 2003; Sohn et al., 2001; Stoll et al., 2002).</p>
<p>The incidence of health care-associated bacteremia increases with decreasing birth weight. Other risk factors include central venous catheter use, prolonged time using parenteral nutrition, prolonged time on mechanical ventilation, use of H2-blocking agents, and overcrowding or heavy staff loads (Adams-Chapman &amp; Stoll, 2002; Barton, Hodgman, &amp; Pavlova, 1999; Gaynes et al., 1996; Stoll et al., 2002). The most common causative organisms are coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, enterococci, <em>Enterobacter</em> sp, and <em>Escherichia coli</em> (Adams-Chapman &amp; Stoll, 2002; Clark et al., "Nosocomial," 2004; Gaynes et al., 1996; Horbar et al., 2001; Payne et al., 2004; Sohn et al., 2001; Stoll et al., 2002).</p>
<p>Effective preventive measures range from simple hand-washing protocols or closed medication delivery systems to more elaborate multidisciplinary quality improvement plans involving hand-washing, nutrition, skin care, respiratory care, vascular access, and diagnostic practices. All of these interventions have been shown to substantially reduce infection rates, albeit in nonrandomized studies using historical or concurrent control units (Adams-Chapman &amp; Stoll, 2002; Aly et al., 2005; Bloom et al., 2003; Clark et al., "Prevention," 2004; Clark et al., "Nosocomial," 2004; Horbar et al., 2001; Lam et al., 2004; Killbride et al., "Implementation," 2003; Killbride et al., "Evaluation," 2003; Ng et al., 2004; Schelonka et al., 2006). For example, six Vermont Oxford Network NICUs reduced their rates of coagulase-negative staphylococcus infections from 22.0% in 1994 to 16.6% in 1996 after implementing a quality improvement model (versus a much smaller decrease from 15.4% to 14.5% at 66 comparison NICUs) (Horbar et al., 2001). A similar reduction from 24.6% to 16.4% was achieved with a multi-modality, multi-hospital intervention focusing on hand hygiene with an effective agent before and after every patient contact, eliminating hand jewelry and artificial nails, using maximal barrier precautions during central venous catheter insertion, decreasing the number of skin punctures, reducing the duration of intravenous lipid and deep line use, and improving the diagnosis of health care-associated infections. (Killbride et al., "Implementation," 2003; Killbride et al., "Evaluation," 2003).</p>
<p>Given the fragility and susceptibility of the patient population, a baseline level of health care-associated infections will be expected, even with good protocols in place. However, those centers that have prevention protocols, and are able to encourage health care workers to adhere to these protocols, will probably have success in reducing their rates of health care-associated bacteremia in their neonatal population. Indeed, several quasi-experimental studies have demonstrated that NICUs can lower their infection rates (based on positive blood cultures) from as high as 13.5 per 1,000 patient days to as low as 3.0 per 1,000 patient days (Adams-Chapman &amp; Stoll, 2002; Aly et al., 2005; Bloom et al., 2003; Clark et al., "Prevention," 2004; Clark et al., "Nosocomial," 2004; Horbar et al., 2001; Lam et al., 2004; Killbride et al., "Implementation," 2003; Killbride et al., "Evaluation," 2003; Ng et al., 2004; Schelonka et al., 2006).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Twenty-six contracted performance measurement systems (PMS) agreed to support the perinatal care measures. Joint Commission staff defined and developed a database structure for electronic receipt of measure data and a verification process was implemented to assure that measures were embedded into the measurement system's technical infrastructures and into their data collection tools in accord with Joint Commission specifications. Joint Commission staff also verified data collection tools and provided education regarding the performance measure set to PMS vendors, who in turn provided education and ongoing support to their contracted hospitals. </p>
<p>Once sufficient data to support this effort were received by The Joint Commission, a reliability assessment of the measures and individual data elements was conducted from October 2011 through January 2012. A data collection tool was developed to facilitate the reabstraction of selected medical records and assessment of the reliability of the data elements. Reliability test site visits were conducted by Joint Commission staff at a subset of 12 randomly-selected hospitals. Selection of the sites was based on multiple characteristics, including hospital demographics, bed size and type of facility. </p>
<p>In the course of the reliability site visits, electronic and paper medical records were blindly reabstracted by Joint Commission staff. Reabstracted data elements were then compared with the hospital's originally abstracted data on a data element to data element basis. Differences in abstraction were investigated and adjudicated in order to understand the reasons for any disparities. In addition, structured focus group discussions were held at each site to gather additional feedback on the measures. A resource evaluation was also completed by the site visit hospitals to assess the cost and time associated with data collection effort. Feedback from the focus group discussions has been incorporated into the measure. </p></div>
