Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>+OOO</strong>, <strong>++OO</strong>, <strong>+++O</strong>, and <strong>++++</strong>); the strength of the recommendation (<strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong>); and the difference between a "recommendation" and a "suggestion" are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaging</strong></p>
<p>In patients with suspected Paget's disease, the Task Force recommends obtaining plain radiographs of the suspicious regions of the skeleton. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients diagnosed with Paget's disease, the Task Force suggests a radionuclide bone scan to determine the extent of the disease and identify possible asymptomatic sites. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Biochemistry</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that after radiological diagnosis of Paget's disease, the initial biochemical evaluation of a patient should be done using serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or with the use of a more specific marker of bone formation when appropriate. (<strong>1|++++</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force recommends measuring a specific marker of bone formation or resorption in patients with Paget's disease and abnormal liver or biliary tract function to assess response to treatment or follow evolution of the disease in untreated patients. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Treatment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Indications</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends treatment with a bisphosphonate (see Table 2 in the original guideline document) for most patients with active Paget's disease who are at risk of future complications. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Choice of Medication</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests a single 5-mg dose of intravenous (IV) zoledronate as the treatment of choice in patients without contraindications. (<strong>2|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Assessing the Response to Treatment</strong></p>
<p>If there is urgency in the control of symptoms or the disease is particularly active, the Task Force suggests the use of short-term response of bone resorption markers before and shortly after treatment to indicate that an adequate therapeutic response is likely. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that patients who have osteolytic lesions of Paget's disease have a repeat x-ray approximately 1 year after radiological diagnosis to determine whether there has been improvement with therapy or worsening in the absence of therapy. Subsequent x-rays may be considered in the event of persistent elevations of biochemical markers of bone turnover or the presence of bone pain and to determine when there is resolution of the lesion. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Maintaining Remission</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that to maximize the duration of remission, bone turnover should be reduced below the midpoint of the reference range for the chosen monitoring bone turnover marker. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Relapse and Retreatment</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force recommends that in patients with increased bone turnover, biochemical follow-up should be used as a more objective indicator of relapse than symptoms. (<strong>1|+++O</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Monostotic Paget's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) or bone-specific ALP (BSAP) and &beta;C-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (&beta;CTx) or N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx) should be used for assessing the activity of untreated monostotic Paget's disease, although these may be normal when evidence of disease activity is still clearly demonstrated on scintigraphy. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management of the Complications of Paget's Disease</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hearing Loss</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests treatment with a potent bisphosphonate to prevent worsening of a hearing deficit. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests the use of analgesics as adjunctive therapy for mild-to-moderate joint pain due to joint cartilage deterioration in patients with Paget's disease adjacent to the painful joint. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p>For patients with severe osteoarthritis adjacent to Paget's disease of bone, the Task Force suggests bisphosphonate therapy before undergoing elective total joint replacement to prevent intraoperative hemorrhaging and postoperative loosening of the prosthesis. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Bowing of Lower Extremity</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests treatment with a potent bisphosphonate before elective surgery for patients who require an osteotomy to correct severe bowing of the lower extremity associated with impaired ambulation and/or severe joint pain. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Paralysis</strong></p>
<p>In cases of paraplegia associated with Paget's disease of the spine, the Task Force suggests immediate treatment with a potent IV bisphosphonate associated with neurosurgical consultation. Surgical intervention may not be necessary after effective medical treatment unless there is severe structural damage. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Neoplasms</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests that patients with osteosarcoma or a giant cell tumor be evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon (ungraded recommendation). If surgery is planned, the Task Force suggests pretreatment with a potent bisphosphonate to reduce bleeding from adjacent pagetic bone. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Congestive Heart Failure</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force suggests treatment with a bisphosphonate in patients with Paget's disease and congestive heart failure. (<strong>2|++OO</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Endocrine Society's Task Force commissioned a systematic review and meta-analysis (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) to evaluate the utility of the available biomarkers in the care of patients with Paget's disease of the bone.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</span></strong></p>
<p>Eligible studies were any type of study that evaluated the utility of using bone turnover markers in patients diagnosed with Paget's disease. In this review, bone scintigraphy was considered as the gold standard to determine disease activity. The bone turnover markers of interests are total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone ALP, amino-terminal procollagen type 1 propeptide (P1NP), serum and urine C-terminal telopeptide (sCTx and uCTx) (alpha or beta isoforms), and urine N-terminal telopeptide (uNTx). Because reviewers were also aiming to evaluate the usefulness of these markers in assessing disease activity after treatment with bisphosphonates, studies that evaluated the utility of bone turnover markers in patients undergoing bisphosphonate treatment were included. Studies that did not report the outcome of interest (correlation coefficient factor between the markers and bone scintigraphy or sensitivity of bone turnover markers to detect Paget's disease) were excluded. Reviewers also excluded publications without original data (clinical reviews and editorials), as well as studies with no available full-text paper. No language or country restrictions were used.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Sources and Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search of several databases from each database's earliest inception to October 2012, which was updated to include studies to December 2014, in any language, was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was designed and conducted by an experienced librarian with input from the study's principle investigator. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for serum and urinary biological markers of Paget's disease. The electronic search was supplemented with manual search and review of bibliographies of included studies. The actual strategy is detailed as Appendix 1 of the systematic review (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Pairs of reviewers independently assessed each abstract for eligibility. Disagreement yielded an automatic inclusion in the upper level of screening. Included studies were retrieved as full text and they were screened in duplicate. Disagreement at this level was resolved by consensus. Information (baseline characteristics and results) were extracted by reviewers independently in duplicate. The principle investigator resolved conflicts in the reviewers' data by referring to the full-text article.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The Endocrine Society's Task Force commissioned a systematic review and meta-analysis (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) to evaluate the utility of the available biomarkers in the care of patients with Paget's disease of the bone.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Reviewers independently extracted study details from the full-text articles using a predesigned online form. The following data were abstracted: study design, country, patient characteristics (number of patients in each arm, sex, and age), follow-up period, details about their Paget's disease (treatment, disease progression, and/or response to treatment definition and markers used).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assessment of Study Quality</span></strong></p>
<p>The quality of included observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle&ndash;Ottawa scale by determining outcome ascertainment, adjustment for confounders, and proportion of patients lost to follow-up as well as sample selection. Quality of the randomized controlled trials (RCT) was assessed using Cochrane's Collaboration's tool by determining the randomization method, blinding, allocation concealment, lost to follow&ndash;up, and source of funding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statistical Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>The main outcome of interest was the correlation between bone turnover marker levels and scintigraphic activity at baseline and after bisphosphonate treatment. The correlation coefficient value and the number of subjects included in the study analysis were extracted. The correlation coefficient values range from &minus;1, +1. Reviewers considered the correlation to be weak if the correlation coefficient value was less than 0.3, moderate if the value ranged between 0.3 and 0.7, and strong if the correlation coefficient value was greater than 0.7.</p>
<p>Other outcomes of interest were the correlation between different bone turnover marker levels and sensitivity of bone turnover markers to detect disease activity. Correlation coefficients were pooled across studies using the random effects model. Statistical analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software.</p></div>

<h3>
Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The recommendation to use total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to screen for the metabolic activity of Paget's disease recognizes the low cost and universal availability of this test in both primary and secondary care. These advantages should be weighed against the greater specificity but somewhat higher cost and possibly restricted availability of more specific bone formation markers. </li>
    <li>For most patients, measurement of total ALP or other baseline disease activity markers at 6 to 12 weeks, when bone turnover will have shown a substantial decline, is an acceptable and cost-effective option. </li>
    <li>Indications for medical intervention are based on cost-effectiveness and a balancing of potential benefits against potential adverse effects. In the case of intravenous (IV) zoledronate for Paget's disease, intervention is usually cheaper (as a result of savings in costs of follow-up investigations and clinical appointments), and results in improved quality of life. </li>
    <li>Now that it is possible to produce disease remission that can be sustained for more than 6 years in the great majority of patients, it becomes more cost-effective and more convenient to treat most patients with active disease who do not have contraindications to IV zoledronate, simply to reduce the costs and time involved in follow-up. </li>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Zoledronate has a satisfactory safety profile, the most common adverse event being a flu-like illness, which occurs in about 25% of patient. Patients need to be warned of this possibility. The frequency and severity of these reactions is reduced by about one-half with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can be used prophylactically. Uveitis and other inflammatory changes in the eye can be a part of the acute phase response, occurring in approximately 1% of patients receiving zoledronate. This requires prompt attention from an ophthalmologist and resolves rapidly and completely with topical steroids. Zoledronate is potentially nephrotoxic, so it should not be administered if the glomerular filtration rate is &lt;35 mL/min. Some physicians use lower doses and longer infusion times in patients with marginal renal function, but this has not been approved by regulatory agencies. Potent bisphosphonates can produce symptomatic hypocalcemia in the presence of marked vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin &lt;D 25 nmol/L). In those at risk of vitamin D deficiency, supplementation before treatment is advisable. A single, large, oral dose of calciferol, 100,000 U, appears to be satisfactory. </li>
    <li>The comparatively high doses of oral bisphosphonates required for the control of Paget's disease are associated with significant upper gastrointestinal side effects. </li>
