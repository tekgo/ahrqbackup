<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of non-skin cancer among men in the United States (U.S.) (Howlander et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012). The current lifetime risk for a male to develop prostate cancer is 15.9 percent (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2012); however, the risk of dying from it is 2.9 percent (Hoffman, 2013). According to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data (2005 to 2009), the median age at diagnosis for men is 67 years of age (American Urological Association [AUA], 2009). Because diagnosis is closely linked to screening, the apparent incidence of prostate cancer increases with increasing age until 84, after which it declines. Although prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of all cancer deaths in the U.S., the survival rates are relatively high, with 23 deaths per 100,000 per year. Localized prostate cancer has a five-year survival rate of 100 percent, and approximately 81 percent of prostate cancers are diagnosed at the local stage (NCI, 2010).</p>
<p>The primary tests used to screen for prostate cancer are the digital rectal exam (DRE), which allows for physical examination of the prostate, and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, which evaluates presence of an antigen in a patient's blood (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). PSA-based screening is commonly used in lieu of DRE. The cost of a PSA test can range from $70 to $400. Approximately 30 million men undergo PSA testing in the U.S. annually, translating to an estimated $3 billion in associated direct costs (Kale et al., 2013; Korenstein et al., 2012).</p>
<p>However, there are a variety of issues associated with PSA-based screening. Research has shown PSA-based screening is not focal, which can result in misdiagnoses and unnecessary performance of diagnostic procedures (AUA, 2009). The likelihood of PSA tests producing false-positive results is also relatively high, with some studies yielding 80 percent false-positive results when the cut-off range used is between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/mL (Schr&ouml;der et al., 2009). Men with false-positive results not only experience negative psychological effects, but are also more likely to have follow-up testing in the following year, including one or more biopsies (Kale et al., 2013).</p>
<p>In addition to issues of test specificity and sensitivity, prostate cancer is subject to over-diagnosis, the detection of a condition that would have remained silent and caused no morbidity during a patient's lifetime. Two large-scale PSA-based screening studies reveal over diagnosis rates ranging from 17 to 50 percent (Kale et al., 2013; Korenstein et al., 2012). The main harms result from complications due to biopsies and treatment that typically follow abnormal results. Studies have shown that out of 1,000 men screened, 110 (11 percent) would be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and roughly half of those diagnosed experience complications from treatment (NCI, 2012). Complications include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, serious cardiovascular events, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (NCI, 2012).</p>
<p>The AUA (2009) recommends against routine PSA screening in men age 70 and older or any man with a life expectancy of less than 10 to 15 years. The USPSTF (2012), however, recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men in the general U.S. population, regardless of age, stating that the overall benefits do not outweigh the associated harms with testing, subsequent diagnosis, procedures and treatment. This recommendation updates the previous (2008) USPSTF recommendation against PSA-based screening among men 75 and older. Evidence supporting the performance of screening among men younger than 75 was limited at the time. </p></div>
