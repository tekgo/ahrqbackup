Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This composite measure is used to assess the percentage of children and adolescents who meet the threshold for having a medical home according to a subset of questions from the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health. The medical home composite measure includes items related to six of the seven components of care first proposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) &mdash; health care that is accessible, family-centered, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective. In the development of the measure, 31 of the 36 concepts in the AAP definition of medical home were assessed to be appropriate for patient report. The measure was designed through a national technical measurement specification panel facilitated by the CAHMI (2001-2003) and has been iteratively reviewed and approved by a national Technical Expert Panel to the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB). The measure builds upon work funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>National initiatives such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Healthy People 2010 have recently begun prioritizing the need to increase children's access to health care delivered under the medical home model, especially among children with special health care needs (Measuring Medical Home for Children and Youth). </p>
<p>Since the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first came out with the definition of a medical home in 1992, many divergent interpretations of the concept have emerged. Many physicians have encountered difficulties with inadequate reimbursement for the care they provide to children within a medical home, even though care provided within a medical home is found to be less costly and more effective than care provided in emergency departments, and other urgent-care facilities (AAP). The medical home model helps physicians improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health care for all children. </p>
<p>The composite measure offered here creates a standardized assessment of whether children have access to an ongoing source of health care within a medical home and are receiving the high-quality care and services they need by using the AAP's multi-dimensional definition of medical home (Measuring Medical Home for Children and Youth). Due to feasibility and methodological constraints, the AAP's entire list of 37 desirable characteristics of a medical home is not included in this composite measure. The "Numerator Inclusions/Exclusions" field below describes how these questions map onto the components of AAP's larger definition of medical home. </p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Nationally, 54.4% of children age 0 to 17 years receive health care that meets the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) definition of medical home. </li>
    <li>Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) are less likely to receive health care within a medical home than non-CSHCN: 46.8% versus 56.3%, respectively. </li>
    <li>Hispanic children are the least likely to receive health care within a medical home (37.2%), followed by Black, non-Hispanic (44.7%), and White, non-Hispanic (65.7%). </li>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The National Center for Health Statistics conducted testing of the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) to make sure the entire survey instrument was functioning properly. A total of 95,677 surveys were completed nationally for children between the ages of 0 and 17 years. The questionnaire was then revised and finalized based on feedback from participants in these interviews.</p>
<p>Both the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Health Plan Survey Child Questionnaire and the CAHPS Children with Chronic Conditions (CCC) surveys were developed by the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (CAHMI) (with substantial input from the CAHPS research team and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ]) and underwent substantial testing before becoming validated measures. The qualitative and quantitative testing of the CAHPS instruments helped inform the current version of this medical home measure as is used in the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health. In particular, three questions from the CCC subset of the CAHPS questionnaire are very similar to items in this medical home measure: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Child's doctors listen carefully to parent (same as K5Q41) </li>
    <li>Getting needed information (same as K5Q43) </li>
    <li>Coordination of care and services (same as K5Q20) </li>
