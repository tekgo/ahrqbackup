<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Review</span></strong></p>
<p>The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team's project coordinator searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines and other relevant content published between 2002 and 2012. This list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites, recommendations from the literature and key Web sites related to abuse and neglect of older adults. Furthermore, Expert Panel members were asked to provide guidelines from their own personal libraries. Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of Web sites searched and inclusion criteria is available in the search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Members of the Expert Panel critically appraised six international guidelines using the <em>Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II</em>. The following three guidelines were used to inform the recommendations and discussions of evidence:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Curran, V., Barrett, J., Hollet, A., &amp; Barrett, L. (2009). <em>Identification of best practices to educate and train health professionals in the recognition, intervention and prevention of violence against older persons</em>.

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Systematic Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive search strategy was developed by RNAO's research team and a health sciences librarian, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the Expert Panel. A search for relevant articles in English and French, published between 2000 and 2013, was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane Controlled Trials (CT), Cochrane Systematic Reviews (SR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), EMBASE, Joanna Briggs Institute, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Progress, Ovid Healthstar, and PsycINFO. In addition to this systematic search, panel members were asked to review personal libraries for key articles not found through the above search strategies.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms, is available in the search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Once articles were retrieved, two Nursing Research Associates (Master's prepared nurses) independently assessed the eligibility of studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The RNAO Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs) Program Manager involved in supporting the RNAO Expert Panel, resolved disagreements.</p>
<p>A complete bibliography of all full text articles screened for inclusion is available (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Initial development of this guideline's purpose and scope included three teleconference focus groups with a total of 26 topic experts and health-care practitioners across Canada, and one in-person focus group with 20 older adults living in Ontario.</p>
<p>For this new guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a pan-Canadian panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas (refer to RNAO Expert Panel). A systematic review of the evidence was based on the purpose and scope of the guideline and supported by five questions. The systematic review captured relevant literature published between 2000 and 2013. The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What are the most effective ways for nurses (and other health-care providers) to identify and assess for abuse and neglect of older adults? </li>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The value of using screening and assessment tools for abuse and neglect of older adults (including tools to assess caregivers) is controversial. Assessment and screening tools hold potential benefits for preventing and addressing abuse and neglect of older adults, but they also have the potential to cause unintentional harm. On the positive side, the tools can detect abuse and neglect and facilitate early intervention. The use of tools can improve care, lead to other positive outcomes, and preserve the older adult's dignity. </li>
    <li>Benefits of formal collaborative teams comprised of these professionals are reported in the literature. For example, one study found that a home support team, which included a nurse, a community psychiatric nurse and a social worker, improved communication among staff, promoted staff development, engagement and confidence, and improved the overall quality of care for residents in long-term care, thereby helping to prevent abuse and neglect. Other benefits of teams include improved care for older adults, assistance on challenging cases, and improved cooperation and understanding among team members. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Potential harms and possible unintended effects from the use of screening and assessment tools include violations of privacy and confidentiality, intrusive and disempowering outcomes, labels of abuse, and inappropriate referrals or interventions when health-care providers lack the skills, time or resources to address the issues appropriately. Furthermore, the content and wording of tools may not be appropriate for all cultures and geographical locations.</p></div>

    <li>This nursing best practice guideline (BPG) is a comprehensive document providing resources for evidence-based nursing practice. It is not intended to be a manual or "how to" guide but rather a template or tool to guide best practices in preventing and addressing abuse and neglect of older adults. The guideline should be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of the individual organizations or practice settings and the needs and preferences of the older adult. In addition, the guideline provides an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care. </li>
    <li>Nurses, other health-care providers and administrators who lead and facilitate practice changes will find this document invaluable for developing policies, procedures, protocols, educational programs and assessments, interventions and documentation tools. Nurses and other health-care providers in direct care will benefit from reviewing the recommendations and the evidence that supports them. The authors particularly recommend that practice settings adapt these guidelines in formats that are user-friendly for daily use. </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implementation Strategies</span></strong></p>
<p>Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multifaceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) <em>Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines (2nd ed.)</em> provides an evidence informed process for doing that.</p>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health care is more likely when</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation </li>
    <li>Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process </li>
    <li>Stakeholders for whom the guideline is relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation </li>
    <li>Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed </li>
    <li>The guideline is tailored to the local context </li>
    <li>Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed </li>
    <li>Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected </li>
    <li>Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process </li>
    <li>There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Toolkit</em> uses the "Knowledge-to-Action" framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.</p>
<p>RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of their guidelines. RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including the Nursing Best Practice Champion Network&reg;, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement and adoption of Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs); and the Best Practice Spotlight Organization (BPSO) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs. In addition, RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific guidelines and their implementation annually.</p>
