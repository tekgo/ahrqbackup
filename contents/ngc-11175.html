<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the class of recommendations (<strong>I, IIA, IIB, III</strong>) and levels of the evidence (<strong>A-C</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mitral Valve Operations and Concomitant Surgical Ablation</span></strong></p>
<p>Surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) can be performed without additional risk of operative mortality or major morbidity, and is recommended at the time of concomitant mitral operations to restore sinus rhythm. (<strong>Class I, Level A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aortic Valve and Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) Operations with Concomitant Ablation</span></strong></p>
<p>Surgical ablation for AF can be performed without additional risk of operative mortality or major morbidity, and is recommended at the time of concomitant isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR), isolated CABG, and AVR plus CABG operations to restore sinus rhythm. (<strong>Class I, Level B nonrandomized</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stand-Alone Surgical Ablation for AF</span></strong></p>
<p>Surgical ablation for symptomatic AF in the absence of structural heart disease that is refractory to class I/III antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter-based therapy is reasonable as a primary stand-alone procedure to restore sinus rhythm. (<strong>Class IIA, Level B randomized</strong>)</p>
<p>Surgical ablation for symptomatic persistent or long-standing persistent AF in the absence of structural heart disease is reasonable as a stand-alone procedure using the Cox-Maze III/IV lesion set compared with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone. (<strong>Class IIA, Level B nonrandomized</strong>)</p>
<p>Surgical ablation for symptomatic AF in the setting of left atrial enlargement (&ge;4.5 cm) or more than moderate mitral regurgitation by PVI alone is not recommended. (<strong>Class III no benefit, Level C expert opinion</strong>)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Considerations for Surgical Ablation Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p>It is reasonable to perform left atrial (LA) appendage excision or exclusion in conjunction with surgical ablation for AF for longitudinal thromboembolic morbidity prevention. (<strong>Class IIA, Level C limited data</strong>)</p>
<p>At the time of concomitant cardiac operations in patients with AF, it is reasonable to surgically manage the LA appendage for longitudinal thromboembolic morbidity prevention (<strong>Class IIA, Level C expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p>Multidisciplinary heart team assessment, treatment planning, and long-term follow-up can be useful and beneficial to optimize outcomes of surgical ablation for AF. (<strong>Class IIA, Level C expert opinion</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Classification of Strength of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> (strong; benefit &gt;&gt;&gt; risk): procedure is useful, effective, and beneficial. Recommendation: procedure should be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Class IIA</strong> (moderate; benefit &gt;&gt; risk): procedure can be useful, effective, and beneficial. Recommendation: procedure is reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Class IIB</strong> (weak; benefit equal to or greater than risk): effectiveness is unknown, unclear, or uncertain. Recommendation: procedure might be reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>, no benefit (moderate; benefit equals risk): procedure is not useful, effective, or beneficial. Recommendation: procedure should not be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>, harm (strong; benefit less than risk): Procedure potentially causes harm or excess mortality and morbidity. Recommendation: procedure should not be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Level of Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong>: high-quality evidence from more than one randomized controlled trial (RCT); meta-analyses or high-quality RCTs; or one or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality registry studies.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Literature searches focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, but also used registries, observational and descriptive studies, reviews, and expert opinion. Emphasis was placed on evidence that was relevant to important clinical questions.</p>
<p>Searches were accomplished in the Medline and EMBASE databases. Formal search results were limited to papers published on human subjects in English after January 1, 2004. The end date for the search was October 2015. The following search terms were used to identify relevant studies: exp Atrial Fibrillation, afib.mp, atrial fibrillation.mp, AF.mp, Surgical adj4 ablation.mp, cyroablation.mp, Ablation Techniques, Radiofrequency adj4 ablation.mp, Cox MAZE or Cox-MAZE.mp, RFA.mp, exp Microwaves, mortality.mp. or exp Mortality, exp Survival/ or Survival.mp, exp Stroke/ or Stroke.mp, Hemorrhage.mp. or exp Hemorrhage, bleeding.mp, heart failure.mp. or exp Heart Failure, exp Patient Readmission, readmission.mp, Heart Block.mp. or exp Heart Block, Reintervention.mp, exp Treatment outcome, exp Treatment failure, exp Recurrence, exp "Quality of Life", exp Reoperation, and exp Pacemaker, Artificial.</p>
<p>The literature search was supplemented by manual examination of the identified studies. Abstracts were reviewed by at least three persons for relevance. A total of 1511 results were obtained, and papers were excluded if they were case reports, were population-based studies covering incidence and risk factors for atrial fibrillation (AF), had a primary focus on nonsurgical procedures, or sought to identify potential outcomes or markers not within the focus of the guideline. The remaining 156 relevant articles were analyzed in detail by the writing group, and recommendations were reviewed and formulated by all members consistent with Institute of Medicine standards for guideline development.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Observational studies were appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Appraisals of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses utilized checklists modeled after those recommended by the Center on Evidence Based Medicine, and all extracted and reviewed data were compiled in the form of evidence tables by three coauthors (see Appendices 2&ndash;4 [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Critical Appraisal</span></strong></p>
<p>The class of recommendation is considered an estimate of the size of the treatment effect, balancing risks versus benefits, and whether a given treatment is or is not useful and effective (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). The level of evidence is an estimate of the certainty or precision of the treatment effect (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Workforce on Evidence Based Surgery assembled a task force in 2015 to address recommendations for surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). The guideline writing committee reviewed the literature and assessed the quality of evidence relative to operation type. Operations were classified as concomitant surgical ablation (SA) associated with primarily open atrial operations (i.e., mitral valve repair or replacement [MVRR]), concomitant SA at the time of primary closed atrial operations (i.e., aortic valve replacement [AVR], coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], or AVR plus CABG), and SA performed as a stand-alone operative procedure.</p>
<p>Guideline generation was sponsored by the STS without commercial support, and formulated by a volunteer member writing committee. A balanced unbiased writing group was assembled, emphasizing both clinical experience and scientific background. The available literature was analyzed in detail by the writing group. Consensus was reached using Delphi methodology to formulate recommendations consistent with Institute of Medicine standards for guideline development. Unanimous consensus was achieved by all writing committee members on the general content, class of recommendations (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) for each recommendation (see Appendix 1 [see the Availability of Companion Documents]).</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>It is clear that surgical ablation is effective in reducing atrial fibrillation (AF) and improving quality of life. It is possible that data from continued longitudinal follow-up of larger patient cohorts will further illuminate the survival benefit of surgical ablation. Given that surgical ablation can currently be applied without increase in operative risk of mortality or major morbidity, and that benefits to long-term rhythm control and quality of life appear consistent, the more frequent performance of guideline-directed surgical ablation may improve patient outcomes.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operative Safety of Surgical Ablation in Mitral Patients</span></strong></p>
<p>Using multivariable regression and propensity matching, a Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database registry study demonstrated safety of surgical ablation concomitant to mitral surgery in a cohort made up of 52% mitral patients. Patients who underwent surgical ablation, however, had a 26% greater likelihood of requiring a permanent pacemaker (risk adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.49, p = 0.007). In a recent randomized trial of mitral valve surgery patients, the authors reported no increase in major operative risk with surgical ablation, but a twofold to threefold higher incidence of pacemaker implantation among patients undergoing ablation versus patients undergoing mitral valve surgery alone. The largest meta-analyses, which included any concomitant operation, however, reported no significant difference in permanent pacemaker implantation. Although influences on nonfatal complications are controversial, it is clear that concomitant ablation has not significantly increased risk of death or major complications.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operative Safety of Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR) or Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), or Both, with Surgical Ablation</span></strong></p>
<p>A recent matched cohort analysis compared 124 patients from a single institution who underwent AVR with or without a concomitant maze procedure. No significant differences were observed in operative mortality and morbidity. Another cohort study of 124 patients also reported no significant difference in mortality and morbidity associated with AVR with or without CABG and concomitant surgical ablation. A 2014 randomized study compared both CABG plus a Cox maze procedure and CABG with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) to CABG alone and reported no in-hospital mortality.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operative Safety of Stand-Alone Surgical Ablation</span></strong></p>
<p>In a 2013 systematic review that compiled results from 23 observational studies with 752 patients who underwent minimally invasive stand-alone procedures, operative mortality was 0.4%. Complication rates attributed to surgery were just 3.2%. Analysis of stand-alone procedures recorded in the STS National Database showed an operative mortality rate of 0.74%. The complication rate was considerably higher at 16.43%, although major morbidities such as stroke (0.72%), renal failure (2.45%), and bleeding (0.99%) were low. Pacemakers were implanted in 1.03% of patients.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations of Studies</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Several of the investigations classified as high-quality evidence documenting the safety endpoint of concomitant surgical ablation (SA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) at the time of primary mitral operations include occasional patients receiving additional secondary operative procedures. Although the majority of populations defined are weighted to persistent or longstanding persistent (nonparoxysmal) AF, occasional studies include mixed populations of paroxysmal AF patients, lending a degree of heterogeneity to the study populations. Finally, selection biases may be inherent to retrospective data that caution interpretation of such studies. </li>
    <li>The majority of evidence documenting the safety endpoint and rhythm efficacy endpoint of concomitant SA for primarily closed atrial procedures (isolated aortic valve replacement [AVR], coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], or AVR plus CABG) include patients receiving additional secondary operative procedures. Whereas the majority of populations defined are weighted to paroxysmal AF, many include persistent or longstanding persistent nonparoxysmal AF, lending a degree of inhomogeneity to the study populations. </li>
    <li>The majority of the studies comprising the evidence documenting the safety endpoint and rhythm efficacy endpoint of stand-alone SA for AF are of moderate quality as they include a variety of lesion sets and energy sources leading to technique variability. Although the majority of defined populations are weighted to paroxysmal AF, many include persistent or longstanding persistent (nonparoxysmal) AF, lending a degree of heterogeneity to the study populations. </li>
