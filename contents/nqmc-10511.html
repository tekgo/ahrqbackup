Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations for members 40 years of age and older who had an acute inpatient discharge or emergency department (ED) visit between January 1 and November 30 of the measurement year and who were dispensed a systemic corticosteroid (or there was evidence of an active prescription) within 14 days of the event.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>While other major causes of death have been decreasing, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality has risen, making it the fourth leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.) (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2006). COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, is usually progressive, and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases ("Global strategy," 2006). COPD defines a group of diseases that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and patients are prone to frequent exacerbations of symptoms that range from chronic cough and sputum production to severe disabling shortness of breath, leading to significant impairment of quality of life ("COPD surveillance," 2006; McCrory et al., 2001).</p>
<p>In addition to being a major cause of chronic disability, COPD is a driver of significant health care service use. The disease results in both high direct and high indirect costs, and exacerbations of COPD account for the greatest burden on the health care system ("Global strategy," 2006), though studies have shown that proper management of exacerbations may have the greatest potential to reduce the clinical, social and economic impact of the disease. Pharmacotherapy is an essential component of proper management.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations or "flare-ups" make up a significant portion of the costs associated with COPD (Pasquale et al., 2012). Approximately 15 million adults in the United States have COPD, an irreversible disease that limits airflow to the lungs, but symptoms can be controlled with appropriate medication (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI], 2012; Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD], 2014). </li>
    <li>The projected total cost of COPD in 2010 was $49.9 billion (NHLBI, 2009). </li>
    <li>One study found that the average cost of an emergency room (ER) visit or inpatient admission for patients with COPD in 2008 was $5,754, and the average length of stay was 4.8 days. These numbers greatly increased for patients whose disease was more severe (Dalal et al., 2011). </li>
    <li>Approximately 641,000 hospital inpatient discharges and 294,000 ER visits in 2010 were due to COPD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2014). </li>
    <li>Because hospital admissions and stays for COPD are the most costly part of the disease, it is essential to take steps to prevent admission or readmission by managing patient medications appropriately. Appropriate prescribing of medication following exacerbation could prevent future flare-ups and drastically reduce the costs of COPD. </li>
