Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grades its recommendations (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, or <strong>I</strong>) and identifies the Levels of Certainty regarding Net Benefit (<strong>High</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, and <strong>Low</strong>). The definitions of these grades can be found at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Recommendation and Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends screening for preeclampsia in pregnant women with blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy (<strong>B recommendation</strong>).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Patient Population under Consideration</strong></p>
<p>This recommendation applies to pregnant women without a known diagnosis of preeclampsia or hypertension.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment of Risk</strong></p>
<p>All pregnant women are at risk for preeclampsia and should be screened. Important clinical conditions associated with increased risk for preeclampsia include a history of eclampsia or preeclampsia (particularly early-onset preeclampsia), a previous adverse pregnancy outcome, maternal comorbid conditions (including type 1 or 2 diabetes prior to pregnancy, gestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, renal disease, and autoimmune diseases), and multifetal gestation. Other risk factors include nulliparity, obesity, African American race, low socioeconomic status, and advanced maternal age.</p>
<p>In the United States, preeclampsia is more prevalent among African American women than among white women. Differences in prevalence may be, in part, due to African American women being disproportionally affected by risk factors for preeclampsia. African American women have case fatality rates related to preeclampsia 3 times higher than rates among white women (73.5 vs. 27.4 per 100,000 cases). Higher prevalence and case fatality rates factor in to why African American women are 3 times more likely to die of preeclampsia than white women. Inequalities in access to adequate prenatal care may contribute to poor outcomes associated with preeclampsia in African American women.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Tests</strong></p>
<p>Blood pressure measurements are routinely used as a screening tool for preeclampsia. The accuracy of blood pressure measurements has been well established. Sphygmomanometry is the recommended method for blood pressure measurement during pregnancy. The patient should be relaxed prior to measurement. After 5 minutes has elapsed, the patient's blood pressure should be read while she is in a sitting position, with her legs uncrossed and her back supported. The patient's arm should be at the level of the right atrium of the heart. If the patient's upper arm circumference is 33 cm or greater, a large blood pressure cuff should be used. Clinicians should avoid measuring blood pressure in the upper arm in the left lateral position because this position falsely lowers blood pressure readings.</p>
<p>Evidence does not support point-of-care urine testing to screen for preeclampsia, as evidence suggests that proteinuria alone may not be a good predictor of preeclampsia health outcomes. Proteinuria measurement is used in the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia.</p>
<p>Recently revised criteria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia include elevated blood pressure (&ge;140/90 mm Hg on 2 occasions 4 hours apart, after 20 weeks of gestation) and either proteinuria (&ge;300 mg/dL on a 24-hour urine protein test, protein to creatinine ratio of &ge;0.3 mg/mmol, or urine protein dipstick reading &gt;1 if quantitative analysis is not available) or, in the absence of proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral or visual symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Screening Interval</strong></p>
<p>Blood pressure measurements should be obtained during each prenatal care visit throughout pregnancy. If a patient has an elevated blood pressure reading, the reading should be confirmed with repeated measurements. Further diagnostic evaluation and clinical monitoring are indicated for patients with elevated blood pressure on multiple measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Management strategies for diagnosed preeclampsia include close fetal and maternal monitoring, antihypertension medications, and magnesium sulfate.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Approaches to Prevention</strong></p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in women who are at high risk for preeclampsia.</p>

<p><strong>USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force defines certainty as "likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct." The net benefit is defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong>: A systematic evidence review was prepared by the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence-Based Practice Center (EPC) for use by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Sources and Searches</span></strong></p>
<p>After an initial search for existing systematic reviews and guidelines, a comprehensive search was performed for primary literature in the MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from 1990 through September 1, 2015 (see the eMethods in the systematic review supplement). Studies published before 1990 were excluded because of changes in diagnostic criteria and treatments in the past 25 years, limiting applicability of earlier evidence. Reference lists of prior reports and publications were also searched. Since September 2015, the systematic review authors continued to conduct ongoing surveillance through article alerts and targeted searches of high-impact journals to identify major studies published in the interim that may affect the conclusions or understanding of the evidence and therefore the related U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation. The last surveillance was conducted on October 5, 2016, and identified no relevant new studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study Selection</span></strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently reviewed 10,082 titles and abstracts and 378 full-text articles against prespecified inclusion criteria (see Figure 2 in the systematic review). Discrepancies were resolved through consensus discussions. English-language, fair- and good-quality studies of pregnant women and adolescents without a diagnosis of preeclampsia and asymptomatic for the condition were included. Studies among women with chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or elevated risk for preeclampsia were also included. Studies were excluded if they solely focused on women seeking high-risk obstetric care, receiving infertility treatment, receiving inpatient care, or if they were conducted in countries not having a high development index designation according to the 2014 United Nations Development Programme. Any standard diagnostic criterion for preeclampsia was allowed.</p>
<p>Screening interventions included point-of-care tests and clinical tools routinely used in prenatal care to screen for preeclampsia, such as blood pressure measurements using manual or automated devices and point-of-care urine tests for proteinuria with qualitative, quantitative, visual, or automated readings. Only studies using the 24-hour urine test as the reference standard to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of urine protein tests were included. Secondary evaluations and tests used to assess preeclampsia severity or to confirm diagnosis were not included. Evidence on the benefits and harms (Key Question [KQ] 1, KQ5) of preeclampsia screening was from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported on maternal and infant mortality, morbidity from eclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, low platelet counts) syndrome, organ damage or failure, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, low birth weight, stillbirth, and placental abruption. Evidence was sought on the screening test performance of clinical blood pressure measurement, urinalysis, or both for identifying women with preeclampsia at the time of screening (KQ4), to compare the effectiveness of different screening protocols (e.g., instruments, test procedures, timing of tests, rescreen intervals) (KQ4a), to assess the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care tests for detecting proteinuria (KQ4b), and to evaluate risk-based screening protocols, compared with general screening (KQ4c).</p>
<p>For assessment of preeclampsia risk (KQ2, KQ3), studies evaluating prediction models for use in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy were included to inform and differentiate screening and preventive interventions (e.g., aspirin prophylaxis) before preeclampsia develops. These were externally validated (i.e., models tested in another population than the derivation study, assessing either performance or effect) multivariable risk prediction models using patient history and routinely collected clinical measures (e.g., body mass index, weight, blood pressure) as well as serum markers and Doppler ultrasound measures (e.g., uterine artery pulsatility index).</p></div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Assessment and Data Extraction</span></strong></p>
<p>Two investigators independently assessed the quality of all included studies using criteria predefined by the USPSTF and supplemented them with other criteria from the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy II for diagnostic accuracy studies (KQ4a) and from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Before-After Quality Assessment Tool for observational studies (KQ3 and KQ5) (see eTable 1 in the systematic review supplement). Each included study received a final quality rating of good, fair, or poor; discrepancies were resolved through discussion. Poor-quality studies (i.e., attrition &gt;40%, differential attrition &gt;20%, or other fatal flaws or cumulative effects of multiple minor flaws or missing information significant enough to limit confidence in the validity of results) were excluded. Good-quality studies met all or most of the assessment criteria; fair-quality studies met only some of the assessment criteria.</p>
<p>One investigator abstracted data from all included studies into an Access database (Microsoft Corp). A second investigator checked the data for accuracy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Synthesis and Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p>Summary evidence tables for each of the key questions include study population characteristics, study design features, and findings. Statistical pooling of results with meta-analysis was not possible for any outcomes because of statistical and clinical heterogeneity due to different study designs, interventions, reference standards, and populations.</p>
<p>Synthesis of included prediction models was informed by methodologic guidance for evaluating performance of multivariable risk prediction models. Model performance was evaluated based on commonly recognized metrics. These include discrimination (<em>c</em> statistic), or area under a receiver operating characteristic curve plot, representing the probability that a case will have a higher risk score than a noncase. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values also measure discrimination. A priori risk-level cutpoints are optimal, but in the preeclampsia prediction literature "detection rates," analogous to sensitivity, were commonly reported, with risk cutpoints corresponding to a 10% false-positive rate (90% specificity). Calibration reflects the extent to which the model predictions match the observed outcomes for individuals across different risk levels; goodness-of-fit tests (e.g., Hosmer-Lemeshow test) are sometimes reported, but calibration plots that graphically depict the observed outcome frequencies against predicted probabilities are more informative. Discrimination and calibration are both necessary for evaluating model performance in validation studies. The models the guideline authors identified with good or better discrimination based on the c statistic (&ge;0.80) are described in this review. Models were classified as to whether they aimed to predict preeclampsia requiring early delivery (&lt;34 weeks' gestation) or a later-onset diagnosis (&ge;34 weeks' gestation)</p></div>

On the basis of this assessment, the USPSTF assigns a letter grade to each preventive service signifying its recommendation about provision of the service (see table below). An important, but often challenging, step is determining the balance between benefits and harms to estimate "net benefit" (that is, benefits minus harms).</p>

<p class="Note">*<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>I (Insufficient)</em> represent the letter grades of recommendation or statement of insufficient evidence assigned by the USPSTF after assessing certainty and magnitude of net benefit of the service (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>The overarching question that the USPSTF seeks to answer for every preventive service is whether evidence suggests that provision of the service would improve health outcomes if implemented in a general primary care population. For screening topics, this standard could be met by a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a representative asymptomatic population with follow-up of all members of both the group "invited for screening" and the group "not invited for screening."</p>
<p>Direct RCT evidence about screening is often unavailable, so the USPSTF considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, the USPSTF constructs a "chain of evidence" within an analytic framework. For each key question, the body of pertinent literature is critically appraised, focusing on the following 6 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Do the studies have the appropriate research design to answer the key question(s)? </li>
    <li>To what extent are the existing studies of high quality? (i.e., what is the internal validity?) </li>
    <li>To what extent are the results of the studies generalizable to the general U.S. primary care population and situation? (i.e., what is the external validity?) </li>
    <li>How many studies have been conducted that address the key question(s)? How large are the studies? (i.e., what is the precision of the evidence?) </li>
    <li>How consistent are the results of the studies? </li>
    <li>Are there additional factors that assist the USPSTF in drawing conclusions (e.g., presence or absence of dose&ndash;response effects, fit within a biologic model)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The next step in the USPSTF process is to use the evidence from the key questions to assess whether there would be net benefit if the service were implemented. In 2001, the USPSTF published an article that documented its systematic processes of evidence evaluation and recommendation development. At that time, the USPSTF's overall assessment of evidence was described as good, fair, or poor. The USPSTF realized that this rating seemed to apply only to how well studies were conducted and did not fully capture all of the issues that go into an overall assessment of the evidence about net benefit. To avoid confusion, the USPSTF has changed its terminology. Whereas individual study quality will continue to be characterized as good, fair, or poor, the term <em>certainty</em> will now be used to describe the USPSTF's assessment of the overall body of evidence about net benefit of a preventive service and the likelihood that the assessment is correct. Certainty will be determined by considering all 6 questions listed above; the judgment about certainty will be described as high, moderate, or low.</p>
<p>In making its assessment of certainty about net benefit, the evaluation of the evidence from each key question plays a primary role. It is important to note that the USPSTF makes recommendations for real-world medical practice in the United States and must determine to what extent the evidence for each key question&mdash;even evidence from screening RCTs or treatment RCTs&mdash;can be applied to the general primary care population. Frequently, studies are conducted in highly selected populations under special conditions. The USPSTF must consider differences between the general primary care population and the populations studied in RCTs and make judgments about the likelihood of observing the same effect in actual practice.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that one of the key questions in the analytic framework refers to the potential harms of the preventive service. The USPSTF considers the evidence about the benefits and harms of preventive services separately and equally. Data about harms are often obtained from observational studies because harms observed in RCTs may not be representative of those found in usual practice and because some harms are not completely measured and reported in RCTs.</p>
<p>Putting the body of evidence for all key questions together as a chain, the USPSTF assesses the certainty of net benefit of a preventive service by asking the 6 major questions listed above. The USPSTF would rate a body of convincing evidence about the benefits of a service that, for example, derives from several RCTs of screening in which the estimate of benefits can be generalized to the general primary care population as "high" certainty (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field). The USPSTF would rate a body of evidence that was not clearly applicable to general practice or has other defects in quality, research design, or consistency of studies as "moderate" certainty. Certainty is "low" when, for example, there are gaps in the evidence linking parts of the analytic framework, when evidence to determine the harms of treatment is unavailable, or when evidence about the benefits of treatment is insufficient. Table 4 in the methodology document listed below (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) summarizes the current terminology used by the USPSTF to describe the critical assessment of evidence at all 3 levels: individual studies, key questions, and overall certainty of net benefit of the preventive service.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peer Review</span></strong></p>
<p>Before the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes its final determinations about recommendations on a given preventive service, the Evidence-based Practice Center and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality send the draft evidence review to 4 to 6 external experts and to Federal agencies and professional and disease-based health organizations with interests in the topic. The experts are asked to examine the review critically for accuracy and completeness and to respond to a series of specific questions about the document. The draft evidence review is also posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. After assembling these external review comments and documenting the proposed response to key comments, the topic team presents this information to the USPSTF in memo form. In this way, the USPSTF can consider these external comments before it votes on its recommendations about the service. Draft recommendation statements are then circulated for comment among reviewers representing professional societies, voluntary organizations, and Federal agencies, as well as posted on the USPSTF Web site for public comment. These comments are discussed before the final recommendations are confirmed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response to Public Comment</span></strong></p>
<p>A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from September 27 to October 24, 2016. Some comments requested elaboration on the urine protein dipstick test. In response, the USPSTF addressed testing for proteinuria in the Clinical Considerations and Rationale sections. Some comments requested more information on screening intervals, which is provided in the Clinical Considerations. Other comments requested clarification about risk prediction of preeclampsia. In response, the USPSTF added information about risk prediction models to the Rationale and Discussion sections.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations of Others</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations for screening from the following groups were considered: the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p></div>

<p>Preeclampsia is a complex syndrome. It can quickly evolve into a severe disease that can result in serious, even fatal health outcomes for the mother and infant. The ability to screen for preeclampsia using blood pressure measurements is important to identify and effectively treat a potentially unpredictable and fatal condition. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found adequate evidence that the well-established treatments of preeclampsia result in a substantial benefit for the mother and infant by reducing maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of risk prediction tools (e.g., clinical indicators, serum markers, or uterine artery pulsatility index) that would support different screening strategies for predicting preeclampsia.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The experiences of the first and second U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), as well as that of other evidence-based guideline efforts, have highlighted the importance of identifying effective ways to implement clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines are relatively weak tools for changing clinical practice when used in isolation. To effect change, guidelines must be coupled with strategies to improve their acceptance and feasibility. Such strategies include enlisting the support of local opinion leaders, using reminder systems for clinicians and patients, adopting standing orders, and audit and feedback of information to clinicians about their compliance with recommended practice.</p>
<p>In the case of preventive services guidelines, implementation needs to go beyond traditional dissemination and promotion efforts to recognize the added patient and clinician barriers that affect preventive care. These include clinicians' ambivalence about whether preventive medicine is part of their job, the psychological and practical challenges that patients face in changing behaviors, lack of access to health care or of insurance coverage for preventive services for some patients, competing pressures within the context of shorter office visits, and the lack of organized systems in most practices to ensure the delivery of recommended preventive care.</p>
<p>Dissemination strategies have changed dramatically in this age of electronic information. While recognizing the continuing value of journals and other print formats for dissemination, the USPSTF will make all its products available through its <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/" title="USPSTF Web site">Web site</a>. The combination of electronic access and extensive material in the public domain should make it easier for a broad audience of users to access USPSTF materials and adapt them for their local needs. Online access to USPSTF products also opens up new possibilities for the appearance of the annual, pocket-size <em>Guide to Clinical Preventive Services</em>.</p>
<p>To be successful, approaches for implementing prevention have to be tailored to the local level and deal with the specific barriers at a given site, typically requiring the redesign of systems of care. Such a systems approach to prevention has had notable success in established staff-model health maintenance organizations, by addressing organization of care, emphasizing a philosophy of prevention, and altering the training and incentives for clinicians. Staff-model plans also benefit from integrated information systems that can track the use of needed services and generate automatic reminders aimed at patients and clinicians, some of the most consistently successful interventions. Information systems remain a major challenge for individual clinicians' offices, however, as well as for looser affiliations of practices in network-model managed care and independent practice associations, where data on patient visits, referrals, and test results are not always centralized.</p></div>
