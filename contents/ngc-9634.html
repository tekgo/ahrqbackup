<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence <strong>(I-III)</strong> and classification of recommendations <strong>(A-E, L)</strong> are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Surgery may account for up to 40% of all hospital adverse events. <strong>(II-2)</strong> </li>
    <li>Good communication is essential for safer surgical care, as communication failure is common in the operating room. <strong>(III)</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The World Health Organization (WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist (SSCL)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>The concept of a SSCL has been studied globally, and there have been decreases in complications and mortality when the checklist has been implemented. <strong>(II-1)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The SSCL should be adopted by all surgical care providers and their respective institutions to improve patient safety. <strong>(II-1A)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surgical Safety Checklist Outline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
    <li>Surgeons should be familiar with, advocate for the use of, and participate in all 3 parts of the SSCL. <strong>(II-1A)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SSCL in Obstetrics</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
    <li>The SSCL may be modified and adapted for use in surgical obstetrics cases. <strong>(II-2A)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emergency Cases</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>Emergency cases such as a "crash" Caesarean section will require a modified approach that is centre- and situation-dependent. <strong>(III)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">International and National Perspectives</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) endorses the adoption of the SSCL in obstetrics and gynaecology. <strong>(III)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence Assessment*</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly randomized controlled trial</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence from well-designed cohort (prospective or retrospective) or case&ndash;control studies, preferably from more than one centre or research group</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from comparisons between times or places with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the results of treatment with penicillin in the 1940s) could also be included in this category</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> There is good evidence to recommend the clinical preventive action</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> There is fair evidence to recommend the clinical preventive action</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The existing evidence is conflicting and does not allow to make a recommendation for or against use of the clinical preventive action; however, other factors may influence decision-making</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> There is fair evidence to recommend against the clinical preventive action</p>
