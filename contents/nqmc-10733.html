Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Increasing activities of daily living (ADL) dependence is associated with decreased quality of life. Greater functional dependency was found to be a risk factor for complications such as pressure ulcers, hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], n.d.; Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, 2007). Although some ADL decline may be an unavoidable consequence of an individual's clinical condition, increased functional dependency can also result from inadequate nursing care or rehabilitation therapies (Degenholtz et al., 2008; Kresevic, 2012). In general, functional dependency increases over time, but this increase is higher for residents with physical or cognitive impairment compared to residents with other medical conditions, such as heart disease (Banaszak-Holl et al., 2011). Risk factors for functional decline include injuries, medication side effects, pain, poor nutrition, weight loss, the use of restraints, prolonged bed rest, and the prolonged use of indwelling catheters (CMS, 2008; Colorado Foundation for Medical Care, 2007; American Health Care Association [AHCA], 2008; B&uuml;rge et al., 2013; Kolanowski et al., 2014). These factors may be mitigated by nursing care, multidisciplinary communication, and referrals for rehabilitation therapies and nutrition services (Horn et al., 2005; Rantz et al., 2012). In addition, improved physical environmental factors (e.g., chairs with arms, improved lighting) may contribute to maintaining or improving function (B&uuml;rge et al., 2013). ADL decline is also associated with substantial Medicare costs. In a study focused on a community-residing sample, 10.0% beneficiaries who declined in function accounted for more than 20.0% of hospital, outpatient, and nursing facility expenditures (Fried et al., 2001).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Race</strong></p>
<p>RTI analyses on the distribution of facility scores on this measure by race indicate that facilities with different proportions of non-white populations do not have different performance scores on this measure. In the analyses, facilities were sorted based on their percentage of non-white residents, and then divided into quartiles: Quartile 1 = 0 to 2.8% non-white (n=3,224); Quartile 2 = 2.8 to 11.7% non-white (n=3,154); Quartile 3 = 11.7 to 32.6% non-white (n=3,191), and Quartile 4 = 32.6 to 100% non-white (3,186). The percentile distributions of performance scores for facilities within these quartiles were then calculated and compared. Overall, there is very little difference in mean facility scores across quartiles, such that in Quartile 4 facilities, the group with the highest proportion of non-white residents, the mean for this quality measure was 15.2%. In comparison, 15.2% of the residents in Quartile 1 facilities, the group with the lowest proportion of non-white residents, experienced an increase in activities of daily living (ADL) dependency. Since these mean scores are virtually identical, the developer conclude that the percentage of non-white residents does not affect performance scores significantly for this measure (RTI International, 2014). </p>
<p><strong>Gender</strong></p>
<p>Gender also has been linked to ADL decline for older adults. In particular, women were found to have significantly lower rates of functional impairment compared to men, even when controlling for condition or illness suggesting gender disparity, which tends to disadvantage women, is not an issue for this measure (Peek et al., 1997; Yoshino et al., 2011).</p>
<p><strong>Socioeconomic Status</strong></p>
<p>Socioeconomic status has also been associated with ADL decline, such that lower status yields a higher risk for ADL decline (Chen et al., 2012; den Ouden et al., 2013; Fuller-Thomson &amp; Gadalla, 2008). To examine the potential for a relationship between socioeconomic disparity and ADL decline, the developer examined the performance of this measure in facilities stratified by the proportion of residents who are Medicaid eligible, a proxy measure of low socioeconomic status. For this analysis, facilities were stratified into two groups: facilities with greater than 75% of residents who are Medicaid eligible and facilities with less than 75% of residents who were Medicaid eligible (75% of facilities have 75% or more of residents included in this measure who are Medicaid eligible). In Quarter 2 of 2014, the mean score on this measure for facilities with a higher proportion of Medicaid eligible residents was 15.5%, versus 14.9% for facilities with a smaller proportion of Medicaid eligible residents. This is a significant difference between the two groups [F(1,15101) = 12.48, p = .0004) but it represents a very small (Eta-squared = 0.000826) effect, meaning that socioeconomic status&ndash;as measured by proportion of Medicaid residents&ndash;explains less than 1/1000 in the variance in provider scores for this measure. Thus, the relationship between socioeconomic status, as stratified by the proportion of residents who are Medicaid eligible, and facility-level scores is quite weak (RTI International, 2014). </p>
<p>Although ADL function may decline over time, empirical evidence on the association between age and functional decline is inconclusive. In one study advanced age was not identified as a significant predictor of ADL decline (Yoshino et al., 2011). Another study found that the risk of functional decline increased with age (Stineman et al., 2013). A U-shape relationship between age and functional decline was also evident, indicating that people younger than 65 years and those older than 80 years are more likely to have ADL limitations (Stineman et al., 2014). </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A joint RAND/Harvard team engaged in a deliberate iterative process to incorporate provider and consumer input, expert consultation, scientific advances in clinical knowledge about screening and assessment, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) experience, and intensive item development and testing by a national Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) consortium. This process allowed the final national testing of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 to include well-developed and tested items.</p>
<p>The national validation and evaluation of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (NHs) (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA NHs (764 residents), regionally distributed throughout the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze inter-rater agreement (reliability) between gold-standard (research) nurses and between facility and gold-standard nurses, validity of key sections, response rates for interview items, anonymous feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment.</p>
<p>Analysis of the test results showed that MDS 3.0 items had either excellent or very good reliability even when comparing research nurse to facility-nurse assessment. In most instances these were higher than those seen in the past with MDS 2.0. In addition, for the cognitive, mood and behavior items, national testing included collection of independent criterion or gold-standard measures. These MDS 3.0 sections were more highly matched to criterion measures than were MDS 2.0 items.</p>
<p>Improvements incorporated in MDS 3.0 produced a more efficient assessment: better quality information was obtained in less time. Such gains should improve identification of resident needs and enhance resident-focused care planning. In addition, including items recognized in other care settings is likely to enhance communication among providers. These significant gains reflect the cumulative effect of changes across the tool, including use of more valid items, direct inclusion of resident reports, improved clarity of retained items, deletion of poorly performing items, form redesign, and briefer assessment periods for clinical items.</p>
