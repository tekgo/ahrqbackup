<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of therapeutic recommendations (<strong>Strong</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong>, <strong>Optional</strong>) is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Genetic Test Interpretation</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinical laboratories usually test for the more frequently observed cytochrome P450 (CYP) D6 (<em>CYP2D6</em>) and <em>CYP2C19</em> genetic variants and translate the results into star-allele (*) nomenclature. Each star-allele, or haplotype, is deﬁned by a speciﬁc combination of single- nucleotide polymorphisms and/or other genetic variants within the <em>CYP2D6 </em>or <em>CYP2C19 </em>gene locus. Supplemental Tables S2 and S5 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provide a list of <em>CYP2D6</em> and <em>CYP2C19</em> alleles and their functional status. Genetic test results are reported as the summary of inherited maternal and paternal star-alleles referred to as a diplotype (e.g., <em>CYP2D6*1/*2</em> and <em>CYP2C19*1/*1</em>). The Supplemental Data (Genetic Test Interpretation Section) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) contains additional information regarding <em>CYP2D6</em> and <em>CYP2C19</em> genetic test interpretation and phenotype assignment.</p>
<p>Different clinical laboratories may use varying methods to predict phenotype from genotype data. Therefore, before any pharmacotherapy modiﬁcations are made based on this guideline, it is advisable to predict a patient's phenotype from genotype as described above and in the Supplemental Data.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therapeutic Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The recommendations below and in Tables 2 and 3 below apply primarily to actions based on genetic tests only; drug interactions and other clinical factors can have a major inﬂuence for prescribing decisions for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and should be taken into consideration before initiating drug therapy. Based on the current literature, recommendations are made for paroxetine, ﬂuvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline. Considerations regarding ﬂuoxetine are discussed below and can be found in the Supplemental Material.</p>
<p><strong><em>CYP2D6</em>-Paroxetine and Fluvoxamine Dosing Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Table 2 summarizes the dosing recommendations for paroxetine (Table 2a) and ﬂuvoxamine (Table 2b) based on CYP2D6 phenotype. Multiple studies have demonstrated that CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers have low or undetectable paroxetine plasma concentrations when compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. Those with undetectable paroxetine plasma concentrations are likely at risk of therapeutic failure. Low paroxetine plasma concentrations may be a risk factor for therapy failure, although the minimal paroxetine therapeutic concentration is not well deﬁned. Because of the risk for therapy failure due to lower drug exposure, an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 should be considered. There are insufﬁcient data to calculate an initial paroxetine dose for CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers. Data are lacking describing the effect of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolism on ﬂuvoxamine therapy; therefore, no dosing recommendations are provided for ﬂuvoxamine in the context of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers. It may be reasonable, though, to select an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 due to the lack of data describing how CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer status inﬂuences ﬂuvoxamine therapy.</p>
<p>Adjustments to paroxetine or ﬂuvoxamine therapy are not warranted based on CYP2D6 status for those who are CYP2D6 extensive or intermediate metabolizers. Self-inhibition of CYP2D6, and potential phenoconversion, may lead to nonlinear kinetics at common doses in certain genotypes. Although CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers may be expected to have a modest increase in drug exposure and may be more susceptible to CYP2D6 inhibition by paroxetine, existing evidence does not support paroxetine or ﬂuvoxamine therapy adjustments. In addition, because <em>CYP2D6</em> diplotypes are inconsistently categorized as extensive or intermediate metabolizers, the literature is difﬁcult to evaluate, thus resulting in a moderate recommendation classiﬁcation for intermediate metabolizers.</p>
<p>When administered similar doses, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have signiﬁcantly greater drug exposure to paroxetine and ﬂuvoxamine when compared to extensive metabolizers. This increase in drug exposure may be a risk factor for drug-induced side effects. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that ﬂuvoxamine should be used cautiously in patients known to have reduced levels of CYP2D6 activity (<a href="http://www.pharmgkb.org/label/PA166104854" title="Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase Web site">http://www.pharmgkb.org/label/PA166104854</a>). To potentially prevent an adverse effect, an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 should be considered for poor metabolizers. If paroxetine or ﬂuvoxamine is warranted, dose extrapolations based on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between phenotype groups suggest a 50% dose reduction of paroxetine and a 30% dose reduction of ﬂuvoxamine. However, a 30% decrease in ﬂuvoxamine dose may not be feasible given the dosage forms; therefore, decreasing the dose of ﬂuvoxamine by 25% to 50% may help prevent adverse events by limiting high drug exposures. Because therapeutic drug monitoring is not common for SSRIs, limited data are available describing the linearity of the dose&ndash;concentration relationship and the relation between paroxetine or ﬂuvoxamine concentrations and therapeutic effect and tolerability. Therefore, this recommendation is considered optional.</p>

<p><strong>Fluoxetine Considerations</strong></p>
<p>CYP2D6 converts ﬂuoxetine to S-norﬂuoxetine while both CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 convert ﬂuoxetine to R-norﬂuoxetine (see Supplemental Figure S1). Fluoxetine and R/S-norﬂuoxetine modulate serotonin reuptake, although R-norﬂuoxetine is thought be less pharmacologically active. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have been demonstrated to possess signiﬁcantly higher ﬂuoxetine plasma concentrations than extensive metabolizers (Supplemental Table S10). However, the total sum of ﬂuoxetine plus norﬂuoxetine plasma concentrations may not vary signiﬁcantly by CYP2D6 phenotypes. Few data are available describing how CYP2D6 phenotype status inﬂuences the total sum of ﬂuoxetine plus norﬂuoxetine concentrations over time, or if an imbalance between ﬂuoxetine and norﬂuoxetine concentrations caused by CYP2D6 phenotype status affects patient outcome or safety. Therefore, no gene-based dosing recommendations are provided for ﬂuoxetine. For CYP2D6 ultra-rapid and poor metabolizers, it may be reasonable to monitor these patients more closely if they are prescribed ﬂuoxetine or to select an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 due to conﬂicting/inconclusive data describing how CYP2D6 status inﬂuences ﬂuoxetine therapy. It is important to note that the prescribing information for ﬂuoxetine states that the drug "should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome" and that caution is warranted in situations that may prolong QT such as "conditions that predispose to increased ﬂuoxetine exposure (overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs)."</p>
<p><strong><em>CYP2C19</em>-Citalopram, Escitalopram, and Sertraline Dosing Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Table 3 summarizes the dosing recommendations for citalopram and escitalopram based on CYP2C19 phenotype. CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers have signiﬁcantly lower exposure to these drugs when compared to extensive metabolizers, and therefore may have an increased probability of failing therapy. Because there are insufﬁcient data to calculate an initial citalopram or escitalopram dose for CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers, an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2C19 may be an option if deemed appropriate given other medications and clinical considerations. Drug&ndash;drug interactions should be considered if selecting an alternative SSRI, such as paroxetine, which inhibits CYP2D6. <em>CYP2C19*17</em> homozygotes have a greater metabolic capacity than <em>CYP2C19*17</em> heterozygotes, and may beneﬁt more from alternative therapy. Given that there may be clinically signiﬁcant differences among CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers based on diplotype (i.e., <em>CYP2C19*1/*17</em> vs. <em>CYP2C19*17/*17</em>), this is a moderate recommendation.</p>
<p>Adjustments to citalopram or escitalopram therapy are not warranted based on CYP2C19 status for those who are CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers. Although CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers may have elevated plasma concentrations, dose extrapolations suggest that minimal dose adjustments are warranted for intermediate metabolizers. Elevated concentrations of these drugs have been observed in poor metabolizers, which may increase the risk of adverse drug reactions. To potentially prevent an adverse effect, an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2C19 should be considered. If citalopram or escitalopram is warranted, an initial dosage decrease of 50% should be considered. For citalopram, the FDA recommends a 50% dose reduction (or a maximum dose of 20 mg/day in adults) for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers due to risk of QT prolongation (the FDA recommendation does not apply to escitalopram). Although limited data are available describing the relationship between SSRI concentrations and therapeutic effect and tolerability, this is a moderate recommendation due to apparent risk of arrhythmias combined with the FDA providing speciﬁc dose recommendations.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic data show reduced oral clearance of sertraline in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers but only slightly increased metabolism in ultrarapid metabolizers. Side effects in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers have also been reported to be more frequent than in normal metabolizers. Therefore, in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers a dose reduction of 50% is recommended or an alternative SSRI not extensively metabolized by CYP2C19 should be considered (Table 3 below). No dose adjustment is recommended for CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers; however, if a patient is not responding to adequate maintenance doses of sertraline, consider an alternative SSRI not predominantly metabolized by CYP2C19. Due to the limited available evidence, this recommendation is optional.</p>

<p>Data describing the relationship between <em>CYP2D6</em> or <em>CYP2C19</em> genotype and SSRI systemic exposure or steady-state plasma concentrations in pediatric patients are scarce (see the Supplemental Data). Because CYP2D6 activity is fully mature by early childhood it may be appropriate to extrapolate these recommendations to adolescents or possibly younger children with close monitoring. CYP2C19 activity may be increased in children relative to adults; therefore, these recommendations should be used with caution in children and accompanied by close monitoring. Ultimately, additional research and clinical trials in pediatric patients investigating the association between CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 and SSRI systemic exposure or treatment outcomes is needed.</p>

<p>The authors searched the PubMed&reg; database (1966 to December 2014) for the following keywords: (cytochrome P450 2D6 or CYP2D6) OR (cytochrome P450 2C19 or CYP2C19) AND (SSRI OR selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors OR fluoxetine OR paroxetine OR citalopram OR escitalopram OR sertraline OR fluvoxamine OR paroxetine) for the association between <em>CYP2D6</em> and/or <em>CYP2C19</em> genotypes and metabolism of SSRIs or SSRI-related adverse drug events or clinical outcomes. Key publications of clinical pharmacogenetic studies on SSRI pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes are reported in Supplemental Tables S7-S11 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The <em>CYP2D6</em> and <em>CYP2C19</em> allele frequency tables are updates of those previously published in Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines. Updates to the <em>CYP2D6</em> and <em>CYP2C19</em> allele frequency tables were made by searching the PubMed&reg; database (1995 to 2014). The following criteria were used for <em>CYP2D6</em>: (CYP2D6 or 2D6 or cytochrome P4502D6) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve "full-text" and "English" literature. The following criteria were used for <em>CYP2C19</em>: (CYP2C19 or 2C19 or cytochrome P4502C19) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency OR minor allele OR variant OR ethnic OR race OR racial OR ethnicity) with filter limits set to retrieve "full-text" and "English" literature. In addition, reports were also identified from citations by others or review articles. Studies were considered for inclusion in the <em>CYP2D6</em> or <em>CYP2C19</em> frequency table if: (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated, (2) either allele frequencies or genotype frequencies were reported, (3) the method by which the genes were genotyped was indicated, (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals with a few exceptions (e.g., smaller cohorts that were part of larger studies) and (5) the study represented an original publication (no reviews or meta-analyses).</p></div>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium's (CPIC's) therapeutic recommendations are based on weighting the evidence from a combination of preclinical functional and clinical data, as well as on some existing disease-specific consensus guidelines. Some of the factors that are taken into account in evaluating the evidence supporting therapeutic recommendations include: in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, in vitro enzyme activity of tissues expressing wild-type or variant-containing cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 (CYP2D6) or CYP2C19, in vitro CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 enzyme activity from tissues isolated from individuals of known <em>CYP2D6</em> or <em>CYP2C19</em> genotypes, and in vivo pre-clinical and clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies.</p>
<p>The evidence summarized in Supplemental Tables S7-S11 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) is graded on a scale of high, moderate, and weak, based upon the level of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The gene-based dosing recommendations in this guideline take into consideration the effects <em>CYP2D6 </em>or <em>CYP2C19 </em>genetic variants may have on both clinical outcomes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Because the pharmacokinetic properties of SSRIs do not differ between healthy volunteers and patients, the authors evaluated pharmacokinetic data acquired from studies performed on healthy subjects and patients to assist in determining if <em>CYP2D6 </em>or <em>CYP2C19 </em>genetic variants affect SSRIs.</p>
<p>Overall, the therapeutic recommendations are simplified to allow rapid interpretation by clinicians. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) uses a slight modification of a transparent and simple system for just three categories for recommendations adopted from the rating scale for evidence-based recommendations on the use of retroviral agents (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations"), in which the desirable effects are closely balanced with undesirable effects and there is room for differences in opinion as to the need for the recommended course of action.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The more common adverse effects induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) include central nervous system effects (e.g., insomnia, headache), gastrointestinal dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction; however, the incidence of side effect occurrence differs with each drug. Serious adverse events such as arrhythmias caused by QT prolongation have been associated with SSRIs, particularly for individuals prescribed citalopram who are cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 (CYP2C19) poor metabolizers. </li>
    <li>When administered similar doses, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have significantly greater drug exposure to paroxetine and fluvoxamine when compared to extensive metabolizers. This increase in drug exposure may be a risk factor for drug-induced side effects. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that fluvoxamine should be used cautiously in patients known to have reduced levels of CYP2D6 activity. </li>
    <li>It is important to note that the prescribing information for fluoxetine states that the drug "should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome" and that caution is warranted in situations that may prolong QT such as "conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure (overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs)." </li>
    <li>FDA product labeling cautions that citalopram dose should be limited to 20 mg/day in patients with hepatic impairment, those taking a CYP2C19 inhibitor, and patients greater than 60 years of age. </li>
    <li>A potential risk is the misinterpretation of genetic test results, as rare or novel variants are typically not interrogated. If an individual carries a rare variant, the actual phenotype may differ from the predicted phenotype. An individual's CYP2D6 and/or CYP2C19 metabolizer status may also depend on other factors including epigenetic phenomena, diet, comorbidities, or comedications. Although <em>CYP2D6</em> and/or <em>CYP2C19</em> genotyping is usually reliable when performed in qualiﬁed laboratories, the possibility for error in genotyping, contamination, or mislabeling of the sample remains. </li>

<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reﬂect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written, and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision-making, as well as to identify questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not speciﬁcally identiﬁed. Guidelines do not account for all individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be solely made by the clinician and the patient. CPIC assumes no responsibility for any injury to persons or damage to property related to any use of CPIC&rsquo;s guidelines, or for any errors or omissions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</span></strong></p>
<p>Patients on a stable and effective dose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) most likely will not beneﬁt from additional dose modiﬁcations based on cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 (<em>CYP2D6</em>) or <em>CYP2C19</em> genotype results. Similar to all diagnostic tests, genetic tests are one of several pieces of clinical information that should be considered before initiating drug therapy.</p></div>
