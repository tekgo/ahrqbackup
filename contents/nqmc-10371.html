<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Hospital admission for perforated appendix is a Prevention Quality Indicator (PQI) that would be of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems. With prompt and appropriate care, acute appendicitis should not progress to perforation or rupture. Rates for perforated appendix are higher in the uninsured or underinsured in both adult and pediatric populations, which may be caused by patients failing to seek appropriate care, difficulty in accessing care, or misdiagnoses and poor quality care.</p>
<p>Perforated appendix rates vary systematically by race, although the cause is unknown. Areas with high rates of perforated appendix may want to target points of intervention by using chart reviews and other supplemental data to investigate the reasons for delay in receiving surgery. Hospital contributions to the overall area rate may be particularly useful for this indicator, because misdiagnoses and other delays in receiving surgery in an emergency room may contribute substantially to the rate.</p>
<p>Perforated appendix is a potentially avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition indicator. These indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of access to high quality outpatient care, and as such are defined with area level denominators.</p>
<p>Timely diagnosis and treatment may reduce the incidence of perforated appendix, and lower rates represent better quality care.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Perforated appendix occurs in one-fourth to one-third of hospitalized acute appendicitis patients (Braveman et al., 1994). Approximately 280,000 appendectomies are performed each year in the United States (Owings &amp; Kozak, 1998). Most are performed as emergencies to avoid the complications of perforated appendicitis; an entity believed to result from delay in surgical removal of the appendix after the appendix has become inflamed. The fear of appendicitis complications results in more emergency general surgical operations than any other disease (Livingston et al., 2007).</p>
<p>Negative exploration rates as high as 30% are considered acceptable for women presenting with lower abdominal pain (Larsson et al., 2001). A retrospective analysis for all patients 18 years of age and over with acute appendicitis between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 at a teaching hospital identified 1003 patients with acute appendicitis of whom 239 (23.8%) had perforated appendix. Patients with public insurance were significantly more likely to have perforated disease (P less than 0.001) as were patients in the older age groups (41 to 64 and = 65) (35.8% and 38.24%, respectively, versus 19.2% for those 18 to 40; P less than 0.001). The patients who presented with perforation had a greater length of stay (2.71 &plusmn; 2.14 versus 6.04 &plusmn; 3.91 d, P less than 0.001) (Boomer et al., 2010).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 2007 State Inpatient Databases (SID) with 4,000 hospitals and 30 million adult discharges. </p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Expert panels and empirical analysis. </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. Perforated appendix occurs in one-fourth to one-third of hospitalized acute appendicitis patients. Based on empirical evidence, this indicator is precise, with a raw area level rate of 33.3% and a substantial standard deviation of 14.4%. </p>
<p>Relative to other indicators, a higher percentage of the variation occurs at the area level rather than the discharge level. However, the signal ratio (i.e., the proportion of the total variation across areas that is truly related to systematic differences in area performance rather than random variation) is low, at 26.5%, indicating that much of the observed differences in age-sex adjusted rates likely do not represent true differences across areas. Applying multivariate signal extraction methods can improve estimation of true differences in area performance. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Data/Sample</em>. AHRQ 2007 SID with 4,000 hospitals and 30 million adult discharges.</p>
<p><em>Analytic Method</em>. Expert panels and empirical analysis. </p>
<p><em>Testing Results</em>. Braveman et al. found that the rate of perforated appendix was 50% higher for patients with no insurance or Medicaid than health maintenance organization (HMO)-covered patients, and 20% higher for patients with private fee-for-service insurance. A follow-up study by Blumberg et al. concluded that the high rate of perforated appendix in the black population at an HMO may be explained by delay in seeking care, rather than differences in the quality of health care. Weissman et al. found that uninsured (but not Medicaid) patients are at increased risk for ruptured appendix after adjusting for age and sex. </p>
<p>Based on empirical results, areas with high rates of perforated appendix admissions tend to have lower rates of admissions for other ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs). </p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The predicted value for each case is computed using a logistic regression model and covariates for gender and age in years (in 5-year age groups).

The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., county, state, and region).
