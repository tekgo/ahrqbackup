<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Accurate assessment of the degree of carotid artery stenosis is essential to guiding proper treatment decisions for patients with carotid artery disease. Trials have demonstrated the ability of the degree of carotid artery stenosis to predict which patients will receive the greatest benefit from surgical intervention ("Beneficial effect," 1991; Mayberg et al., 1991; Hobson et al., 1993; Executive Committee for the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study, 1995). To ensure accurate assessment of stenosis, it is important to use a standardized validated approach. Rothwell et al. demonstrated significant differences between measurements of stenosis made using different methods of measurement (Rothwell et al., "Equivalence of measurements," 1994; Rothwell et al., "Prognostic value," 1994).</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and other references</strong>:</p>
<p>The panel recommended that the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method of calculating stenosis measurement should be used when angiography is used to correlate ultrasound (US) findings (Grant et al., 2003).</p>
<p>When magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) techniques are used for determining carotid stenosis, the report should reflect the methodology and reference the criteria for percent stenosis outlined in the NASCET. Also, the percent stenosis must be calculated using the distal cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) diameter, where the walls are parallel, for the denominator. Similar to computerized tomographic angiography (CTA), MRA with attention to the acquisition parameters and post-processing techniques can provide cross sectional measurements of stenosis that correlate with properly performed NASCET estimates of percent stenosis obtained with catheter angiography. In the setting of near occlusion, it may not be accurate to calculate percent stenosis ratios in the presence of post-stenotic arterial diameter decrease. Some MRA techniques may not be amenable to quantitative measurements, in which case qualitative measurements of stenosis should be provided (American College of Radiology [ACR] et al., 2010).</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Importance of Topic</strong><br />
As imaging technology continues to advance, the United States healthcare system has seen an increase in both the type and frequency of imaging studies being performed. The increase in utilization of imaging studies is accompanied by a corresponding increase in cost and exposure to radiation for both patients and healthcare professionals. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the number of radiologic procedures performed in the United States showed a ten-fold increase while the annual per-capita effective dose from radiologic and nuclear medicine procedures increased by 600% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, the number of computerized tomographic (CT) examinations tripled, while the number of ultrasounds nearly doubled (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1996 to 2010, advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e., CT, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine, and ultrasound) accounted for approximately 35% of all imaging studies (Smith-Bindman et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>From 1980 to 2006, the proportion of radiation exposure that is attributable to medical sources increased from 17% to 53% (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, while CT scans only accounted for approximately 17% of all radiologic procedures performed in the United States, they accounted for over 65% of the total effective radiation dose from radiologic procedures (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>In 2006, the estimated per-capita effective radiation dose for radiologic procedures in the United States was nearly 20% higher than the average for other well-developed countries (Mettler et al., 2009). </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic imaging was prioritized as a topic area for measure development due to a high level of utilization, rising costs, and the need for measures to help promote appropriate use of imaging and improve outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong><br />
There is wide variance in how stenosis is currently documented and reported. A 2013 study by Cheng et al. of 127 Veteran's Affairs medical centers found inconsistency in the method of reporting as well as which clinical thresholds were used to determine severity of stenosis. In addition, Giurgea et al. (2012) demonstrated significant differences in classification of carotid stenosis among different clinical settings. </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on a measure testing project in 2011 with Telligen to ensure four radiology measures were reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator, and exception case identification. The testing project was conducted utilizing electronic health record data and claims data. Inter-rater reliability was tested. Three sites in three states participated in the testing of the measures. All three sites were in urban settings. Site A was a group practice with 10 physicians. Site B was a hospital-based group practice with 90 physicians. Site C was a hospital-based practice with greater than 1000 physicians.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong><br />
The purpose of reliability testing was to evaluate whether the measure definitions and specifications, as prepared by the PCPI, yield stable, consistent measures. Data abstracted from chart records were used to calculate inter-rater reliability for the measures. </p>
<p>Some of the measures in this set are being made available without any prior testing. The PCPI recognizes the importance of testing all of its measures and encourages testing of the diagnostic imaging measurement set for feasibility and reliability by organizations or individuals positioned to do so. The <em>Measure Testing Protocol for PCPI Measures</em> was approved by the PCPI in 2010 and is available on the PCPI Web site (see Position Papers at <a href="http://www.physicianconsortium.org" title="PCPI Web site">www.physicianconsortium.org</a>); interested parties are encouraged to review this document and to contact PCPI staff. The PCPI will welcome any opportunity to promote the initial testing of these measures and to ensure that any results available from testing are used to refine the measures before implementation. </p></div>

<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Direct or Indirect Reference to Measurements of Distal Internal Carotid Diameter as the Denominator for Stenosis Measurement</em>: Includes direct angiographic stenosis calculation based on the distal lumen as the denominator for stenosis measurement OR an equivalent validated method referenced to the above method (e.g., for duplex ultrasound studies, velocity parameters that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">correlate</span> with anatomic measurements that use the distal internal carotid lumen as the denominator for stenosis measurement) </li>
    <li><em>Numerator Instructions</em>: This measure requires that the estimate of stenosis included in the report of the imaging study employ a method such as the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method for calculating the degree of stenosis. The NASCET method calculates the degree of stenosis with reference to the lumen of the carotid artery distal to the stenosis. For duplex imaging studies the reference is indirect, since the degree of stenosis is inferred from velocity parameters and cross referenced to published or self-generated correlations among velocity parameters and results of angiography or other imaging studies which serve as the gold standard. In Doppler ultrasound, the degree of stenosis can be estimated using Doppler parameter of the peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the internal carotid artery (ICA), with concordance of the degree of narrowing of the ICA lumen. Additional Doppler parameters of ICA-to-common carotid artery (CCA) PSV ratio and ICA end-diastolic velocity (EDV) can be used when degree of stenosis is uncertain from ICA PSV. </li>
    <li><em>Documentation</em>: Information populating the final report may reside in a dedicated field in the electronic health record (EHR) or picture archiving and communication system (PACS), however stenosis measurement information should be included in the final report in order to be readily accessible in all circumstances. </li>
