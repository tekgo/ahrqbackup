Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the average change between lumbar discectomy/laminotomy pre-operative and three months (6 to 20 weeks) post-operative functional status as measured with the Oswestry Disability Index, version 2.1a.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Overall, spine surgery rates have declined slightly from 2002 to 2007, but the rate of complex spinal fusion procedures has increased 15-fold, from 1.3 to 19.9 per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Complications increased with increasing surgical invasiveness, from 2.3% among patients having decompression alone to 5.6% among those having complex spinal fusions. After adjustment for age, comorbidity, previous spine surgery, and other features, the odds ratio (OR) of life-threatening complications for complex spinal fusion compared with decompression alone was 2.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.50 to 3.49) (Deyo et al., 2010). Minnesota, as compared to national Medicare statistics, demonstrates a lumbar spinal fusion rate that is four times the national average (0.84 per 1000 enrollees as compared to 0.2 per 1000) (Center for the Evaluative Clinical Services, 2006). Spinal fusion has become one of medicine's most controversial procedures. Some surgeons argue that spinal fusion is appropriate only for a small number of conditions, such as spinal instability, spinal fracture or severe curvature of the spine and that the financial incentives have caused the procedure to become overused. Others say that it is a useful tool to treat patients who have debilitating back pain and have tried other options like physical therapy to no avail (Carreyrou &amp; McGinty, 2010).</p>
<p>For consumers, there is a lack of publicly reported information that would provide patients with an understanding of potentially how well they will function after having lumbar spinal surgery. These measures will provide outcome data for patients that currently do not exist.</p></div>
