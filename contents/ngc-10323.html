Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em><strong>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong></em>: The following guidance was current as of 2014. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/kidney.html" title="University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text of the original guideline document for detailed information on each of the screening procedures.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<ul typ="disc">
    <li>Despite increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), it is often under-recognized and under-treated. [<strong>A</strong>] </li>
    <li>Evidence for screening and management of early stage CKD is limited due to absence of large randomized controlled trials. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definition and Staging</strong> (see Table 1 and Table 2 in the original guideline document)</p>
<p>Kidney damage for &ge;3 months, defined by structural or functional abnormalities of the kidney, with or without decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Screen patients with diabetes annually for microalbuminuria if not on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and for creatinine and estimated GFR [<strong>IA</strong>]. Consider screening for CKD among patients at increased risk, especially those with hypertension [<strong>IA</strong>] and patients aged &gt;55 years. [<strong>IID</strong>] </li>
    <li>Laboratory studies needed to diagnose and stage CKD include an assessment of GFR (usually estimated by the Modification in Diet and Renal Disease Study [MDRD] equation) and urine studies for the presence or absence of albuminuria. [<strong>IC</strong>] </li>
    <li>Ultrasound imaging for structural kidney disease may also be helpful in certain populations. [<strong>IID</strong>] </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Blockade of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system with either an ACEI or an ARB is the cornerstone of treatment to prevent or decrease the rate of progression to end stage renal disease. [<strong>IA</strong>] </li>
    <li>Blood pressure control (&lt;140/90) reduces renal disease progression and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Current evidence does not support stricter blood pressure control targets for the majority of patients with CKD [<strong>IA</strong>]. CKD patients with albuminuria may benefit from tighter control with a target of &lt;130/80 [<strong>IIA</strong>]. </li>
    <li>Optimally manage comorbid diabetes and address cardiovascular risk factors to decrease risk for cardiovascular disease &ndash; the leading cause of mortality for patients with CKD. [<strong>IA</strong>] Statin or statin/ezetimibe therapy is recommended in all CKD patients age &ge;50 years to decrease the risk of cardiovascular or atherosclerotic events. [<strong>IA</strong>] </li>
    <li>Monitor for other common complications of CKD including: anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, abnormal fluid balance, mineral bone disease, and malnutrition. [<strong>ID</strong>] </li>
    <li>Avoid nephrotoxic medications to prevent worsening renal function. [<strong>ID</strong>] </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Follow Up</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The timing and frequency of CKD monitoring and follow up depends on disease severity and risk for progression; GFR and albuminuria should be assessed a minimum of once per year. [<strong>ID</strong>] (see Table 16 in the original guideline document) </li>
    <li>Refer CKD stage G4 or G5 (see Table 2 in the original guideline document) to nephrology for co-management and preparation for renal replacement therapy. Consider referral at earlier stage to assist with diagnosis of underlying cause and/or treatment of common complications of CKD. [<strong>IC</strong>] </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Strategy for Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The team began the search of literature by accepting the results of the literature searches performed for fairly recent systematic reviews:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Black C, Sharma P, Scotland G, McCullough K, McGurn D, Robertson L, et al. Early referral strategies for management of people with markers of renal disease: a systematic review of the evidence of clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and economic analysis. [MEDLINE search through Jan 2009.] </li>
    <li>Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD&ndash;MBD Work Group. KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of chronic kidney disease&ndash;mineral and bone disorder (CKD&ndash;MBD). [full search through Dec 2007, randomized controlled trials (RTCs) through Nov 2008] </li>
    <li>VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of chronic kidney disease in primary care [search through Dec. 2006] </li>
    <li>K/DOQI clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification. Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative. [search through June 2000] </li>
</ul>
<p>To update those searches with more recent literature and to examine literature on other topics, a systematic search of literature on MEDLINE was performed.</p>
<p>The major search terms were: "chronic kidney disease excluding end stage renal disease"; time frame started with 1/1/07 unless a more recent review (above) addressed the topic; type of publication was guidelines, controlled trials (including meta-analyses), and cohort studies; population was human/adult; and language was English.</p>
<p>Within these parameters individual searches were performed for the following topics: screening; assessment of renal function/staging; history and symptoms; physical exam; laboratory tests; imaging; renin-angiotensin system blockade (ACEI, ARB, optimizing blood pressure, reducing albuminuria, inhibition of renal fibrosis); treatment of diabetes mellitus and of hypertension; management of dyslipidemia, smoking, and aspirin therapy; management of anemia, mineral bone disease, metabolic acidosis, potassium and sodium balance, fluid balance/volume management, and malnutrition; dietary recommendations (sodium, protein, malnutrition), medication dose adjustment/medications to avoid/nephrotoxic medications; psychiatric disorders (depression); sleep quality and sleep disorders; sexual dysfunction, monitoring and follow-up; pregnancy, geriatrics, minorities, and other results for the major search terms not included in the above specific searches. The specific search strategy is available upon request.</p>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure, which is available upon request. The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A recent cost-effectiveness analysis concluded that annual urine dipstick testing for albuminuria in patients with diabetes or hypertension, as well as those aged 55 years and older without concurrent diabetes or hypertension, was cost-effective. </li>
    <li>A recent Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline suggests statin + ezetimibe as an alternative to statin monotherapy, especially in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &le;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (e.g., g3a-5). In clinical practice, this approach may be limited by the higher cost of ezetimibe compared with statin monotherapy. </li>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Many herbs can potentially interact with prescription medications or cause additional kidney damage in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD). </li>
    <li>In certain CKD populations, including the elderly and those with diabetes mellitus, aggressive blood pressure control could lead to negative outcomes such as acute deterioration in kidney function, increased risk for cardiovascular events and orthostatic hypotension. </li>
</ul>
<p>See Table 7 in the original guideline document for adverse effects associated with common agents for renin angiotensin aldosterone blockade used in treatment for CKD.</p>
<p><strong>Statins</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Recent studies have provided conflicting evidence regarding the benefit of statins among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving renal replacement therapy. Some of the studies have demonstrated an increased risk of cerebrovascular events among dialysis patients taking statins. </li>
    <li>The use of standard doses of statins appears safe among most patients with CKD and does not require special monitoring beyond that for non-CKD patients. More intensive statin regimens have not been well studied in patients with CKD and there is concern that this population is at higher risk for adverse events related to the medication. </li>
    <li>For patients with CKD G1-G2, the only exception to statin drugs used in the general population is that 40 mg of rosuvastatin daily is not recommended because of potential increased risk for adverse renal event. </li>
