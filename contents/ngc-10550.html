<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the level of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendation (<strong>I-III</strong>) are provided at the end of the Major Recommendations field.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been reported in randomized, controlled trials comparing active and sham stimulation. Based on the literature, the following recommendations can be made: (1) There is Level I evidence, based on a single Level I study, for the use of bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS for the treatment of medically refractory OCD. (2) There is Level II evidence, based on a single Level II study, for the use of bilateral nucleus accumbens DBS for the treatment of medically refractory OCD. (3) There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for the use of unilateral DBS for the treatment of medically refractory OCD.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Classification </strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: Evidence provided by &ge;1 well-designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials, including overview (meta-analyses) of such trials</p>
<p><strong>Level II</strong>: Evidence provided by well-designed observational studies with concurrent controls (e.g., case-control and cohort studies)</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: Evidence provided by expert opinion, case series, case reports, and studies with historical controls</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: Generally accepted principles for patient management that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (usually this requires Level I evidence that directly addresses the clinical questions or overwhelming Level II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials)</p>
<p><strong>Level II</strong>: Recommendations for patient management that reflect clinical certainty (usually this requires Level II evidence or a strong consensus of Level III evidence)</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: Other strategies for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion)</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This systematic review was conducted and reported according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). A literature search was undertaken using the PubMed database for articles published between 1966 and October 2012 combining the following words: "Deep Brain Stimulation and obsessive-compulsive disorder" or "electrical stimulation and obsessive-compulsive disorder." These searches resulted in 353 abstracts, which were reviewed by three independent investigators. The flow of information through the different phases of the review is presented in the Figure in the original guideline document. Relevant articles were selected for full-text review and had to meet the following article inclusion and exclusion criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clinical series with 6 or more patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). This limit was chosen because, due to the small number of subjects included, studies with fewer than 6 patients often reported the outcomes of individual patients rather than analyzing data for the whole population. In addition, with small sample sizes, the presence of outliers can significantly compromise the analysis of data. </li>
    <li>Clinical series with a minimum postoperative follow-up of 6 months. Although ideally longer follow-up intervals would be desirable, the 6-month timeline was selected because it was the most common follow-up interval reported in the studies pooled for analysis in the review. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusion</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Studies including only preclinical data </li>
    <li>Review articles </li>
    <li>Letters to the editor </li>
    <li>Clinical series with fewer than 6 patients </li>
    <li>Clinical series with a follow-up shorter than 6 months </li>
    <li>Articles reporting on patient populations other than those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) </li>
    <li>Clinical series in which ablative surgery was used instead of DBS </li>
    <li>Reports that mainly addressed aspects related to surgical technique </li>
</ul>
<p>Of 352 articles, 7 original articles were retrieved for analysis. A total of 345 studies were excluded for the following reasons: 188 were review articles, 22 included only preclinical data, 51 were letters to the editor or had fewer than 6 patients, 44 addressed other diseases (e.g., Parkinson disease, Tourette syndrome), 6 reported on the effects of ablative procedures instead of DBS, and 34 addressed questions pertinent to targeting or surgical technique. One article was common to both search lists and was included only once.</p></div>
