Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Note from the Association of periOperative Nurses (AORN)</strong>: Sharps safety is a priority in the perioperative environment and includes considerations for standard precautions, health care worker vaccination, post-exposure protocols and follow-up treatment, and treatment for health care workers infected with a bloodborne pathogen. These topics are addressed in other recommended practices documents, and although they are mentioned briefly where applicable (e.g., standard precautions), the broader discussions of these topics are outside the scope of this document.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>Health care facilities must establish a written bloodborne pathogens exposure control plan (29 Code of Federal Regulation [CFR] 1910.1030, 2009). </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel must use sharps with safety-engineered devices (i.e., engineering controls) (29 CFR 1910.1030, 2009). </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel must use work practice controls when handling scalpels, hypodermic needles, suture needles, bone fragments, K-wires, burrs, saw blades, drill bits, trocars, razors, bone cutters, towel clips, scissors, electrosurgical tips, skin hooks, retractors, and other sharp devices (29 CFR 1910.1030, 2009; Perry, Parker, &amp; Jagger, 2005; Perry, Parker, &amp; Jagger, 2009). </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel must use personal protective equipment (PPE) </li>
    <li>Sharp devices must be contained and disposed of safely. </li>
    <li>The perioperative registered nurse (RN) should demonstrate personal and professional responsibility in preventing sharps injuries and preventing the transmission of bloodborne pathogens. </li>
    <li>Personnel should receive initial and ongoing education and competency verification on their understanding of the principles of and performance of the processes for sharps safety (Kak, Burkhalter, &amp; Cooper, 2001). </li>
    <li>Documentation should reflect activities related to sharps safety (29 CFR 1910.1030, 2009). </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for sharps safety processes and practices should be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should participate in a variety of quality improvement activities to monitor and improve the prevention of sharps injuries. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Evidence Review</strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE&reg;, CINAHL&reg;, Scopus&reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses, randomized and non-randomized trials and studies, systematic and non-systematic reviews, guidelines, case reports, and opinion documents and letters.</p>
<p>Search terms included: needlestick injuries, sharps injuries, blood-borne pathogens, occupational accidents, occupational injuries, medical staff, nurses, perioperative nursing, operating room nursing, perioperative nurses, operating room nurses, operating rooms, surgical procedures, surgical instruments, safety devices, sutures, scalpels, sharps, scalpel injuries, needlesticks, needle sticks, safety scalpels, safety-engineered sharps, blunt-tip needles, hands-free passing, neutral zone, double gloving, and double-gloving.</p>
<p>The lead author and medical librarian identified and obtained relevant guidelines from government agencies, other professional organizations, and standards-setting bodies. The lead author assessed additional professional literature, including some that initially appeared in other articles provided to the author.</p>
<p>The initial search was conducted in 2011 and was limited to articles published in English from 1992, when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Bloodborne Pathogens Final Standard was established. The librarian established continuing alerts on sharps safety-related topics and provided relevant results to the lead author. The lead author and medical librarian also identified relevant guidelines from accreditation organizations, government agencies, and standards-setting bodies. In addition, the lead author requested other articles identified through literature appraisal and other outside sources.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Articles identified by the search were provided to the project team for evaluation. The team consisted of the lead author, three members of the Recommended Practices Advisory Board, two members of the Research Committee, and a doctorally prepared evidence appraiser. The lead author divided the search results into topics and assigned members of the team to review and critically appraise each article using the Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice Model and the Research or Non-Research Evidence Appraisal Tools as appropriate. The literature was independently evaluated and appraised according to the strength and quality of the evidence. Each article was then assigned an appraisal score as agreed upon by consensus of the team.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Evidence from a meta-analysis or systematic review of research studies that incorporated evidence appraisal and synthesis of the evidence in the analysis. </li>
    <li>Supportive evidence from a single well-conducted randomized controlled trial. </li>
    <li>Guidelines that are developed by a panel of experts, that derive from an explicit literature search methodology, and include evidence appraisal and synthesis of the evidence. </li>

<p><strong>1: Regulatory Requirement</strong>: Federal law or regulation.</p>
<p><strong>2: Moderate Evidence</strong>: Interventions or activities for which the evidence is less well established than for those listed under "Strong Evidence."</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Supportive evidence from a well-conducted research study. </li>
    <li>Guidelines developed by a panel of experts which are primarily based on the evidence but not supported by evidence appraisal and synthesis of the evidence. </li>
    <li>Non-research evidence with consistent results and fairly definitive conclusions. </li>
