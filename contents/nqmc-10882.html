Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the annual crude rate of emergency department (ED) visits for heat-related illness per 100,000 employed persons age 16 years and older.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>State health agencies, which are vested with the legal authority to require disease reporting and collect health data, play a central role in public health surveillance. Whereas public health surveillance was once focused primarily on infectious diseases, it has expanded in recent years to include surveillance of a wide range of health outcomes and their determinants, including chronic diseases, injuries and health behaviors (Halperin &amp; Horan, 1998). National statistics on occupational injuries and illnesses have been collected largely outside of the public health infrastructure and rely almost entirely on data reported by employers. State health agencies that have access to a wide variety of public health data systems have an important role in the surveillance of occupational diseases, injuries and hazards.</p>
<p>Minimal epidemiological information about occupational heat-related morbidity is available. Tracking occupational heat-related illness using emergency department data will establish a baseline for occupational epidemiologists to understand the magnitude of the disease burden in the population and support implementation and evaluation of prevention measures.</p></div>

<h2>Evidence Supporting the Measure

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Exposure to environmental heat is a clear recognized hazard for many occupations where individuals are not able to maintain thermal equilibrium due to their work environment (e.g., hot and humid), required clothing type, and usage of protective equipment. In 2010, approximately 3,470 private sector workers experienced a nonfatal work-related illness (e.g., heat stroke) due to environmental heat exposure which required days away from work. Up to 17% of individuals with heat stroke have permanent neurological damage, the likelihood of which increases the longer it takes to receive treatment. Further, workers suffering from heat-related illness are at higher risk of other occupational injuries due to neurological impairment. A 2015 study of occupational heat-related illness in 9 southeastern states found significantly elevated emergency department (ED) rates among males, younger workers and blacks. Significant variation in age-adjusted rates among the states was observed with rates ranging from 4.8 per 100,000 workers in Florida to 17.3 per 100,000 workers in Louisiana.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 1998, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), in association with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), convened the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group to make recommendations to NIOSH concerning State-based surveillance activities for the coming decade. </p>
<p>The Work Group recognized the need to pilot test 19 indicators to assess the feasibility of widespread implementation and to develop specific guidance on how to compute the proposed measures. In summer 2002, the five "Core" states with NIOSH Cooperative Agreements to conduct "Core Occupational Health Surveillance" (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Washington) agreed to pilot test the indicators and to create user-friendly "how-to" guides so that other states could calculate the indicators. </p>
<p>Subsequent to the initial pilot testing by the five "Core" states, eight additional states (Connecticut, Maine, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin) pilot tested the "how-to" guides. Feedback from these additional states was incorporated into the development of the final "how-to" guides for 19 indicators in November 2004.</p>
<p>Procedures to review, approve, and implement new indicators were developed by the Work Group. In 2013, a fourteenth health effect indicator (<em>Asthma among Adults Caused or Made Worse by Work</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-first indicator. In 2014, a fifteenth health effect indicator (<em>Work-Related Severe Traumatic Injury Hospitalizations</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-second indicator. </p></div>
