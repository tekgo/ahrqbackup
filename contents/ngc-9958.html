Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of June 2013. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/fhp/practiceguides/breast.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key aspects and recommendations summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text for detailed information on each of the screening procedures.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Aspects and Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Palpable Mass or Asymmetric Thickening/Nodularity on Physical Exam</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discrete masses</span> elevate the index of suspicion. Physical exam cannot reliably rule out malignancy.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Breast imaging is the next diagnostic approach to aid in diagnosis <em>[I C]</em>. </li>
    <li>Initial imaging evaluation: if age &ge;30 years then mammogram followed by breast ultrasound; if age &lt;30 years then breast ultrasound <em>[I C]</em>. Follow-up depends on results (see Figure 1 of the original guideline document). </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Asymmetrical thickening/nodularity</span> has a lower index of suspicion, but should be assessed with breast imaging based on age as for patients with a discrete mass. If imaging is:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suspicious or highly suggestive</span> (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] category 4 or 5) or if the area is assessed on clinical exam as suspicious, then biopsy after imaging <em>[I C]</em>. Referral to a breast care specialist may be useful. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Probably benign</span> (BI-RADS 3): if clinically benign, observe every 3&ndash;6 months and image every 6&ndash;12 months for 2 years to assess stability <em>[I C]</em>; if clinically suspicious, biopsy tissue <em>[I C]</em>. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Negative or benign</span> (BI-RADS 1 or 2): if clinically benign, then follow-up physical exam in 3 months <em>[I C]</em>, if clinically suspicious, biopsy tissue <em>[I C]</em>. Simple cysts (Benign finding, BI-RADS 2) need aspiration only if symptomatic. <em>[I C]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Referral to breast care specialist</span> is also recommended for: (a) any suspicious mass or (b) any woman at very high risk for breast cancer <em>[I D]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Inflammation and Other Skin Changes</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If cellulitic breast skin changes</span>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not completely resolve after a course of antibiotics</span>, refer to a breast specialist for consideration of breast biopsy to rule out inflammatory breast cancer <em>[I C]</em>. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Are associated with a fluctuant, painful mass</span>, refer to a breast specialist or emergency department for management of a possible breast abscess <em>[I C]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If eczematoid changes of the nipple-areolar skin persist</span> &gt;1-2 weeks or do not respond to topical treatment, refer to a breast specialist for possible biopsy to rule out Paget's disease of the nipple <em>[I C]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Breast Pain With Negative Physical Exam (see Figure 2 in the original guideline document)</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If physical exam and appropriate breast imaging are negative</span>, the likely diagnosis is benign mastalgia: reassure patient. A trial of topical agents is reasonable (see text of the original guideline document) <em>[II A]</em>. Recommendation for a well-fitted bra is often helpful <em>[II C]</em>. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If persistent or localized pain</span> not responsive after 2-3 months of conservative treatment, refer to breast specialist <em>[I C]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nipple Discharge Without Abnormal Exam Findings (see Figure 3 in the original guideline document)</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If discharge is spontaneous or watery/serous or if other risk factors are present</span> (persistent, serosanguinous, single duct), refer to a breast specialist and consider diagnostic imaging <em>[I C]</em>. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If discharge is non-spontaneous</span>, if clearly galactorrhea, pursue medical workup and do not refer to breast specialist <em>[I C]</em>. If discharge is from multiple ducts and gray to green in color, do not refer to a breast specialist unless patient requests referral for symptomatic relief <em>[I C]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Populations</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pregnant women</span>. If concerning indications, imaging is relatively safe and should be done <em>[I C]</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Men</span>. Diagnose and treat enlargement or pain <em>[I C]</em>. Breast mass is rare, but suspicious for cancer <em>[I C]</em>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Augmented breasts</span>. Evaluation/management of above conditions is similar, but imaging issues <em>[I C]</em>.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The literature searches for this update began with the results of the literature searches performed for the earlier version of this guideline through June 2005. For this update the Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis Guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012) and its supporting literature through early 2012 was used to address the topics of: palpable mass, asymmetric thickening/nodularity, inflammation and other skin changes, breast pain. To supplement that literature, searches in MEDLINE were performed. For the major keywords of adult women; since 6/1/2005; English language; and guidelines, controlled trials (including meta-analyses), and cohort studies; specific searches were performed for breast pain, galactorrhea and other nipple discharge, and breast mass in pregnancy. For the major keywords of adult men; since 6/1/2005; English language; and guidelines, controlled trials (including meta-analyses), and cohort studies; specific searches were performed for breast mass or pain.</p>
<p>The searches were supplemented with recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. The search was single cycle.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Mammography as a diagnostic tool may result in false negatives, especially in younger women. Overall, 10% of diagnostic mammograms are false negatives, with approximately twice the rate for younger women and half that rate for women over age 65. </li>
    <li>For evaluation of solid masses, or nonpalpable masses detected by mammography, the sensitivity of fine needle aspiration (FNA) is variable, primarily dependent on the skill of the aspirator. Estimates of false negatives range from 1% to 35% for palpable lesions and up to 68% for nonpalpable lesions. </li>
    <li>Side effects of hormonally active medicines tend to limit their tolerability. </li>
