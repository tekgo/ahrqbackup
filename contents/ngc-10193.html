<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>A-C</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on good or consistent scientific evidence (Level A)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Systemic hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen alone or in combination with progestin, is the most effective therapy for vasomotor symptoms related to menopause. </li>
    <li>Low-dose and ultra-low systemic doses of estrogen are associated with a better adverse effect profile than standard doses and may reduce vasomotor symptoms in some women. </li>
    <li>Given the variable response to HT and the associated risks, it is recommended that health care providers individualize care and treat women with the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration that is needed to relieve vasomotor symptoms. </li>
    <li>The risks of combined systemic HT include thromboembolic disease and breast cancer. </li>
    <li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs), clonidine, and the gabapentin are effective alternatives to HT for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms related to menopause. </li>
    <li>Estrogen therapy effectively alleviates atrophic vaginal symptoms related to menopause. Local therapy is advised for the treatment of women with only vaginal symptoms. </li>
    <li>Paroxetine is the only nonhormonal therapy that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. </li>
    <li>The FDA approved ospemifene for treating moderate-to-severe dyspareunia in postmenopausal women. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following conclusions are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Data do not support the use of progestin-only medications, testosterone, or compounded bioidentical hormones for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. </li>
    <li>Data do not show that phytoestrogens, herbal supplements, and lifestyle modifications are efficacious for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. </li>
    <li>Nonestrogen water-based or silicone-based vaginal lubricants and moisturizers may alleviate vaginal symptoms related to menopause. </li>
    <li>Common sense lifestyle solutions such as layering of clothing, maintaining a lower ambient temperature, and consuming cool drinks are reasonable measures for the management of vasomotor symptoms. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendation is based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The decision to continue HT should be individualized and be based on a woman's symptoms and the risk&ndash;benefit ratio, regardless of age. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case&ndash;control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on limited or in consistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 2000 and April 2013. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guide lines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician-gynecologists were used.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Hormone Therapy (HT)</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although HT is well tolerated by most women, standard doses may cause adverse effects, such as breast tenderness, vaginal bleeding, bloating, and headaches. </li>
    <li>The risks of systemic combined HT include thromboembolic disease and breast cancer. The majority of trials that analyzed the safety of HT have assessed preparations containing conjugated equine estrogen alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of healthy menopausal women aged 50 to 77 years, demonstrated a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolic events and a decreased risk of fractures and colon cancer after an average of 5 years of combined HT. Among women receiving estrogen only, there was an increased risk of thromboembolic events, but not an increased risk of cardiovascular events or breast cancer. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clonidine</strong></p>
<p>Common adverse effects reported were dry mouth, insomnia, and drowsiness.</p>
<p><strong>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Selective Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SSNRIs)</strong></p>
<p>Reported adverse effects included nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, nervousness, constipation, somnolence, sweating, and sexual dysfunction, but these generally resolved with time or dose adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>Gabapentin</strong></p>
<p>Common adverse effects from gabapentin include dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema.</p>
<p><strong>Estrogen Agonists and Estrogen Antagonists</strong></p>
<p>Common adverse effects of ospemifene reported during clinical trials included hot flushes, vaginal discharge, muscle spasms, genital discharge, and excessive sweating.</p></div>
