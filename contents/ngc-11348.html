<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes. It is recommended that the intervention be provided selectively on the basis of professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&ndash;There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&ndash;It is recommended that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Criteria for level of evidence and recommendations (A, B, C, I, D) are based on standard language from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016). Suggested recommendations are based on the available evidence and content experts' clinical expertise regarding the value of using such evidence.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The systematic review sought to answer the following question: What is the effectiveness of cancer rehabilitation interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to address the activity and participation needs of adult cancer survivors in activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, work, leisure, social participation, and rest and sleep? </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Method</span></strong></p>
<p>Search terms for the review were developed by the methodology consultant to the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) Evidence-based Practice (EBP) Project and AOTA staff, in consultation with the review authors of the question and the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to make sure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. Table D.1 in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to population (adults with cancer), types of intervention, outcomes, sequelae, and types of study design included in the systematic review. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted all searches and confirmed and improved the search strategies. </p>
<p>Databases and sites searched included MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and OTseeker. In addition, consolidated information sources, such as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were included in the search. These databases are peer-reviewed summaries of journal articles and provide a system for clinicians and scientists to conduct systematic reviews of selected clinical questions and topics. Reference lists from articles included in the systematic reviews were examined for potential articles, and selected journals were hand searched to ensure that all appropriate articles were included. </p>
<p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria are critical to the systematic review process because they provide the structure for the quality, type, and years of publication of the literature that is incorporated into a review. Included articles were peer-reviewed scientific literature on participants with cancer published in English between 1995 and 2014 and within the scope of practice of occupational therapy. The review excluded data from presentations, conference proceedings, non&ndash;peer-reviewed research literature, dissertations, and theses. The review also excluded studies focusing on caregivers, family members, and friends, rather than on cancer survivors, and studies of childhood cancer. Studies included in the review provide Level I, II, and III evidence. Level IV evidence was included only when higher level evidence on a given topic was not found; no Level V studies were included.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection of Articles</span></strong></p>
<p>A total of 8,436 citations and abstracts were identified through searches of databases and reference lists of articles included in the review. Removal of duplicates left 6,717 citations and abstracts. The three-person review team completed the step of eliminating references on the basis of citations and abstracts. A total of 945 full-text articles remained and were retrieved. After the initial full-text review, the articles were reduced to 437, which received an in-depth full review.</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The team working on the focused question reviewed the articles according to their quality (scientific rigor and lack of bias) and levels of evidence. Each article included in the review was abstracted using an evidence table that provides a summary of the methods and findings of the article. The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) staff and the Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Project consultant reviewed the evidence tables to ensure quality control. All studies are summarized in full in the evidence tables in Appendix E in the original guideline document. </p>
<p>The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the methods described by Higgins, Altman, and Sterne (2011). The method for assessing the risk of bias of systematic reviews was based on the measurement tool developed by Shea et al. (2007). An analysis of the articles included in the systematic review that served as the basis of this practice guideline was completed using risk-of-bias tables (see Appendix E in the original guideline document).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>A major focus of the American Occupational Therapy Association's (AOTA's) Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) projects is an ongoing program of systematic review of multidisciplinary scientific literature, using focused questions and standardized procedures to identify practice-relevant evidence and discuss its implications for practice, education, and research. An evidence-based perspective is founded on the assumption that scientific evidence of the effectiveness of occupational therapy intervention can be judged to be more or less strong and valid according to a hierarchy of research designs, an assessment of the quality of the research, or both. </p>
<p>AOTA uses standards of evidence modeled on those developed in evidence-based medicine. This model standardizes and ranks the value of scientific evidence for biomedical practice using a grading system. In this system, the highest level of evidence, Level I, includes systematic reviews of the literature, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In RCTs, participants are randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group, and the outcomes of both groups are compared. Other levels of evidence include Level II studies, in which assignment to a treatment or a control group is not randomized (cohort study); Level III studies, which do not have a control group; Level IV studies, which use a single-case experimental design, sometimes reported over several participants; and Level V studies, which are case reports and expert opinion that include narrative literature reviews and consensus statements. </p>
<p>The systematic review on adults with cancer was supported by AOTA as part of the EBP Project. AOTA is committed to supporting the role of occupational therapy in this important area of practice. </p>
<p>The systematic review covered the period from 1995 to 2014 because occupational therapy practitioners need access to the results of the latest and best available literature to support intervention within the scope of occupational therapy practice. The question that was the basis for the review was developed by the review authors and reviewed by an advisory group of content experts in the field (occupational therapists and physician oncologists), AOTA staff, and the methodology consultant to the AOTA EBP Project.</p></div>

<h3>
Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strength of Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>&ndash;There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>&ndash;There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>&ndash;There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes. It is recommended that the intervention be provided selectively on the basis of professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>&ndash;There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>&ndash;It is recommended that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Criteria for level of evidence and recommendations (A, B, C, I, D) are based on standard language from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016). Suggested recommendations are based on the available evidence and content experts' clinical expertise regarding the value of using such evidence.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The studies that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review did not explicitly report potential adverse events associated with the interventions evaluated in these studies. If harms were noted, they would have been explicitly reported in the summary of key findings and would have been taken into account in the determination of the recommendations. </p>
<p>Before implementing any new intervention with a client, it is always prudent for occupational therapy practitioners to be aware of the potential benefits and harms of the intervention. Clinical reasoning based on a sound evaluation of the client's strengths and limitations and an understanding of the intervention should be exercised to determine the potential benefits and harms of an intervention for an individual patient. Finally, clinical reasoning is also required to translate the intervention protocols used in the studies reviewed into client-centered, clinically feasible interventions.</p></div>
