<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>State health agencies, which are vested with the legal authority to require disease reporting and collect health data, play a central role in public health surveillance. Whereas public health surveillance was once focused primarily on infectious diseases, it has expanded in recent years to include surveillance of a wide range of health outcomes and their determinants, including chronic diseases, injuries and health behaviors (Halperin &amp; Horan, 1998). National statistics on occupational injuries and illnesses have been collected largely outside of the public health infrastructure and rely almost entirely on data reported by employers. State health agencies that have access to a wide variety of public health data systems have an important role in the surveillance of occupational diseases, injuries and hazards.</p>
<p>Among adults, lead poisoning is a persistent, mainly occupational, health issue that continues to be an important public health problem. The most widely available test for exposure is the blood lead level (BLL). The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standards to protect workers from lead associated health effects include requirements for monitoring BLLs among employees who meet certain exposure criteria. The standards are based on medical information that is more than 30 years old and are not protective against the adverse health effects of lead. Lower medical removal recommendations have been proposed to protect workers against the adverse health effects of both acute and cumulative lead exposures. It is important to note that the average BLL for the general population is less than 1.5 &mu;g/dL.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Since November 2015, the surveillance case definition for an elevated blood lead level (BLL) used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) includes workers age 16 and older, with blood lead concentrations of greater than or equal to 5 &mu;g/dL (greater than or equal to five micrograms per deciliter) of whole blood, in a venous blood sample. This case definition is used by the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). In 2010, the CDC included, for the first time, elevated BLLs defined as a blood lead concentration greater than or equal to 10 &mu;g/dL, as a Nationally Notifiable Non-Infectious Condition. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that BLLs among all adults be reduced to less than 10 &mu;g/dL. In 2012, a total of 41 states submitted data on 7,529 adults with BLLs greater than or equal to 25 &mu;g/dL and 38 states submitted data on 27,218 adults with BLLs greater than or equal to 10 &mu;g/dL. Overall, the national prevalence of BLLs greater than or equal to 10 &mu;g/dL declined from 26.6 adults per 100,000 employed in 2010 to 22.5 in 2012. The national prevalence of BLLs greater than or equal to 25 &mu;g/dL declined from 14.0 adults per 100,000 employed in 1994 to 5.7 in 2012. In 2012, state prevalence rates of BLLs greater than or equal to 25 &mu;g/dL were above the national rate (5.7/100,000) in 10 states and state prevalence rates of BLLs greater than or equal to 10 &mu;g/dL were above the national rate (22.5/100,000) in 12 states. Historically, in the United States, most lead exposures have been occupational. During 2002 to 2012, the annual proportion of BLLs greater than or equal to 25 &mu;g/dL from occupational exposures was 94.7% among participating states (minimum: 93.3% in 2012; maximum: 95.5% in 2004). In 2012, among the 37 states that reported the exposure source for adults with BLLs greater than or equal to 25&mu;g/dL, the proportion of occupational cases by state ranged from 38.9% to 100%.</p>
<p>Many adults in the United States continue to have BLLs above levels known to be associated with acute and chronic adverse effects in multiple organ systems ranging from subclinical changes in function to symptomatic intoxication. These include neurologic, cardiovascular, reproductive, hematologic, and kidney adverse effects. The risks for adverse chronic health effects are even higher if the exposure is maintained for many years. Current research has found decreased renal function associated with BLLs at 5 &mu;g/dL and lower, and increased risk of hypertension and essential tremor at BLLs below 10 &mu;g/dL. Children also suffer the adverse effects of lead and about 24,000 United States children with BLLs of 10 &mu;g/dL or greater are estimated to be exposed from lead unintentionally brought home by a parent from the workplace. Pediatric effects include neurologic damage, learning disabilities, and behavior problems.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In 1998, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), in association with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), convened the NIOSH-States Occupational Health Surveillance Work Group to make recommendations to NIOSH concerning State-based surveillance activities for the coming decade. </p>
<p>The Work Group recognized the need to pilot test 19 indicators to assess the feasibility of widespread implementation and to develop specific guidance on how to compute the proposed measures. In summer 2002, the five "Core" states with NIOSH Cooperative Agreements to conduct "Core Occupational Health Surveillance" (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Washington) agreed to pilot test the indicators and to create user-friendly "how-to" guides so that other states could calculate the indicators. </p>
<p>Subsequent to the initial pilot testing by the five "Core" states, eight additional states (Connecticut, Maine, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Wisconsin) pilot tested the "how-to" guides. Feedback from these additional states was incorporated into the development of the final "how-to" guides for 19 indicators in November 2004.</p>
<p>Procedures to review, approve, and implement new indicators were developed by the Work Group. In 2013, a fourteenth health effect indicator (<em>Asthma among Adults Caused or Made Worse by Work</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-first indicator. In 2014, a fifteenth health effect indicator (<em>Work-Related Severe Traumatic Injury Hospitalizations</em>) was developed and pilot tested. The Work Group voted to adopt this as the twenty-second indicator. </p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Other Available Data</strong>: Age, gender, industry, occupation, individual blood lead level (BLL), and all lead test reports (i.e., not just those exceeding the specified criteria)</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>: Because adverse health effects can begin at BLLs below 10 &mu;g/dL, it is recommended that states also calculate the number and rate of elevated BLLs at 5 &mu;g/dL. In addition, many states have data elements that can be used to better define the pattern of elevated BLLs. Report numbers and rates for occupational cases only, rather than including both occupationally and non-occupationally exposed persons in the numerator. Include occupationally exposed cases working in your state (e.g., employer is based in your state, or, if able to determine, worksite is in your state), regardless of their state of residence. Age, gender, and race/ethnicity specific counts and rates can be used to better define the pattern of elevated BLLs. Industry and occupation information can be used to provide additional insight. Individual BLLs can help identify particularly egregious exposures. Follow-up of selected cases and/or clusters can help identify where/how individuals with high BLLs were exposed. Obtaining reports on all BLLs can provide insight about the overall frequency of BLL testing, and allow follow-up of employers not doing required testing.</p></div>
