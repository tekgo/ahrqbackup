<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>One of the most important developments in pediatrics in the past two decades has been the emergence of a new chronic disease: obesity in childhood and adolescence. The rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity among children is one of the most challenging dilemmas currently facing pediatricians. In addition to the growing prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents, overweight children at risk of becoming obese are also of great concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that overweight children and adolescents are more likely to become obese as adults. For example, one study found that approximately 80 percent of children who were overweight at 10 to 15 years of age were obese adults at age 25 (Whitaker et al., 1997). Another study found that 25 percent of obese adults were overweight as children; it also found that if overweight begins before 8 years of age, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe (Freedman et al., 2001).</p>
<p>Body mass index (BMI) is a useful screening tool for assessing and tracking the degree of obesity among adolescents. Screening for overweight or obesity begins in the provider's office with the calculation of BMI. Providers can estimate a child's BMI percentile for age and gender by plotting the calculated value of BMI with growth curves published and distributed by the CDC (Dorsey et al., 2005). Medical evaluations should include investigation into possible endogenous causes of obesity that may be amenable to treatment, and identification of any obesity-related health complications (Inge et al., 2004).</p>
<p>Because BMI norms for youth vary with age and gender, BMI percentiles rather than absolute BMI must be determined. The cut-off values to define the heaviest children are the 85th and 95th percentiles. In adolescence, as maturity is approached, the 85th percentile roughly approximates a BMI of 25, which is the cut-off for overweight in adults. The 95th percentile roughly approximates a BMI of 30 in the adolescent near maturity, which is the cut-off for obesity in adults. The cut-off recommended by an expert committee to define overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 95th percentile) is a conservative choice designed to minimize the risk of misclassifying non-obese children (Baker et al., 2005).</p>
<p>About two-thirds of young people in grades 9 to 12 do not engage in recommended levels of physical activity. Daily participation in high school physical education classes dropped from 42 percent in 1991 to 33 percent in 2005 (CDC, 2007). In the past 30 years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for children. Among young people, the prevalence of overweight increased from 5.0 percent to 13.9 percent for those aged 2 to 5 years; from 6.5 percent to 18.8 percent for those aged 6 to 11 years; and from 5.0 percent to 17.4 percent for those aged 12 to 19 years. In 2000, the estimated total cost of obesity in the United States (U.S.) was about $117 billion. Promoting regular physical activity and healthy eating, as well as creating an environment that supports these behaviors, is essential to addressing the problem (CDC, 2007).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Over the last three decades, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013). It is the primary health concern among parents in the United States, topping drug abuse and smoking (American Heart Association [AHA], 2013). Childhood obesity has both immediate and long-term effects on health and well-being. </li>
    <li>The direct medical costs associated with childhood obesity total about $19,000 per child, contributing to the $14 billion spent on care related to childhood obesity in the United States (Finkelstein, Graham, &amp; Malhotra, 2014).</li>
    <li>More than one-third of children and adolescents in the United States are overweight. Approximately 17 percent are obese (CDC, 2013; CDC, "Overweight and obesity," 2012).</li>
    <li>Children and adolescents who are obese are more likely to be obese as adults and are therefore at risk for adult health problems, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and several types of cancer (CDC, 2013).</li>
    <li>Healthy lifestyle habits, including healthy eating and physical activity, can lower the risk of becoming obese and developing related diseases (CDC, 2013). Obesity can become a lifelong health issue; therefore, it is important to monitor weight problems in children and adolescents and provide guidance for maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle (CDC, "NCHS data brief," 2012).</li>
