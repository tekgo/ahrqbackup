<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Heterogeneous study designs, inconsistent nomenclature, continuous nature of leiomyoma size and location, and insufficient patient recruitment significantly limit the interpretation of results from existing studies that evaluate the impact of fibroids on the likelihood of achieving pregnancy and maintenance of pregnancy. </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to conclude that myomas reduce the likelihood of achieving pregnancy with or without fertility treatment. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to determine that a specific myoma size, number, or location (excluding submucosal myomas or intramural myomas impacting the endometrial cavity contour) is associated with a reduced likelihood of achieving pregnancy or an increased risk of early pregnancy loss. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is insufficient evidence that removal of subserosal fibroids improves fertility. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>There is fair evidence that myomectomy does not impair reproductive outcomes (clinical pregnancy rates, live-birth rates) following assisted reproductive technology (ART). (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does Myomectomy Impact the Likelihood of Pregnancy Loss?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does Resection of Submucosal Fibroids (Type 0, 1, or 2) Improve Fertility?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>There is fair evidence that hysteroscopic myomectomy for submucosal fibroids improves clinical pregnancy rates. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does Hysteroscopic Resection of Submucosal Myomas Affect Miscarriage Rates?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to conclude that hysteroscopic myomectomy reduces the likelihood of early pregnancy loss in women with infertility and a submucous fibroid. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In asymptomatic women with cavity-distorting myomas (intramural with a submucosal component or submucosal), myomectomy (open or laparoscopic or hysteroscopic) may be considered to improve pregnancy rates. </li>
    <li>Myomectomy is generally not advised to improve pregnancy outcomes in asymptomatic infertile women with non&ndash;cavity-distorting myomas. However, myomectomy may be reasonable in some circumstances, including but not limited to severe distortion of the pelvic architecture complicating access to the ovaries for oocyte retrieval. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This clinical practice guideline was based on a systematic review of the literature performed in the electronic database MEDLINE through PubMed on March 3, 2016. No limit or filter was used for the time period covered or English language, but articles were subsequently culled for English language.</p>
<p>A combination of the following medical subject headings or text words were used: abortion; ART; assisted reproductive techn*; birth; embolization; embolization/therapeutic; embryo transfer; endoscopic; endoscopy; fertility; fertilization in vitro; fibroid; fibroma; fibromyoma; hysteroscopy; intrauterine; intrauterine insemination; intrauterine pathology; intrauterine pathologies; in vitro fertilization; in vitro fertilisation; IUI; IVF; laparoscopic; laparoscopy; laparotomy; leiomyoma; metroplast*; miscarriage; myoma; myomect*; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; removal; reproductive techniques, assisted; uterine; uterine myomectomy; uterine neoplasms; uterus. </p>
<p>Initially, titles and abstracts of potentially relevant articles were screened and reviewed to develop inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Only studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed in the final analysis. Studies were eligible if they met one of the following criteria: primary evidence (clinical trials) that assessed the effectiveness of a procedure correlated with an outcome measure (pregnancy, ovulation, or live-birth rates); meta-analyses; and relevant articles from bibliographies of identified articles.</p>
<p>Four members of an independent task force reviewed the full articles of all citations that potentially matched the predefined selection criteria. Final inclusion or exclusion decisions were made on examination of the articles in full. Disagreements about inclusion among reviewers were discussed and resolved by consensus or arbitration after consultation with an independent reviewer/epidemiologist.</p></div>
