Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendations (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Neurological Examination</strong></p>
<p><em>Level II</em></p>
<p>The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) international standards for neurological and functional classification of spinal cord injury (SCI) are recommended as the preferred neurological examination tool for clinicians involved in the assessment and care of acute spinal cord injury patients.</p>
<p><strong>Functional Outcome Assessment</strong></p>
<p><em>Level I</em></p>
<p>The Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) III is recommended as the preferred functional outcome assessment tool for clinicians involved in the assessment, care, and follow-up of patients with SCIs.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Associated with SCI</strong></p>
<p><em>Level I</em></p>
<p>The International Spinal Cord Injury Basic Pain Data Set (ISCIBPDS) is recommended as the preferred means to assess pain, including pain severity, physical functioning, and emotional functioning, among SCI patients.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>A variety of injury classification schemes have been utilized to describe patients who have sustained SCIs. There are 2 general types of assessment scales, neurological examination scales and functional outcome scales. The most accurate and meaningful description of SCI patients, in the acute setting and in longitudinal follow-up, is that accomplished by using a neurological scale in conjunction with a functional outcome scale. Based on a contemporary evaluation and ranking of the medical evidence, the 2000 ASIA Standards is the most consistent, reliable, valid, and responsive scoring system for the neurological assessment of adult patients with acute SCI, to a high degree of scientific certainty. This recommendation is supported by <strong>Class II</strong> medical evidence.</p>
<p>The SCIM III, designed specifically to assess the functional abilities and impairment of patients with spinal cord lesions and SCI, is the functional outcome assessment tool with the greatest scientific validity, reliability, and sensitivity. This recommendation is supported by <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence.</p>
<p>The assessment of pain among patients with SCI is important and should include an evaluation of pain severity, physical functioning, and emotional functioning. There are a number of pain assessment classification instruments that have been used in this patient population. The ISCIBPDS has the highest reliability and validity of any of the pain classification instruments and is recommended on the basis of <strong>Class I</strong> medical evidence.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A computerized search of the database of the National Library of Medicine (PubMed) of the literature published from 1966 to 2011 was performed for each of the 3 subtopics reviewed in this guideline: neurological assessment, function outcome, and pain following spinal cord injury (SCI). The search was limited to the English language, the human literature, and reviews, case series, meta-analyses, and randomized clinical trials of adult patients published between 1966 and 2011. The term "spinal cord injury" was combined with the term "neurological assessment," yielding 1444 references. A second search using the terms "spinal cord injury" and "assessment scales" yielded 81 references. A third search employing the terms "spinal cord injury" and "assessment scores" revealed 178 publications. A search using "ASIA impairment scale" yielded 351 citations. A search using the terms "ASIA classification" and "spinal cord" yielded 113 references (total 2167).</p>
<p>For functional outcome, each PubMed database search was limited to the English language, the human literature, and reviews, case series, meta-analyses, and randomized clinical trials published between 2000 and 2010. Search terms "spinal cord injury" and "functional outcomes assessment" yielded 448 references. Search terms "spinal cord injury" and "functional outcome scales" yielded 28 citations. A search for "functional independence measure" resulted in 1,132 references. A search for "spinal cord independence measure" revealed 190 citations (total 1798).</p>
<p>For pain following SCI, each PubMed database search was limited to the English language, the human literature, and reviews, case series, meta-analyses, and randomized clinical trials published between 1966 and 2010. Search terms "spinal cord injury" and "pain" resulted in 2093 references. Search terms "spinal cord injury" and "pain classification" yielded 91 citations. A search using the terms "spinal cord injury" and "pain assessment scales" produced 26 references. Search terms "spinal cord injury" and "pain assessment scale" resulted in 121 references (total 2,331).</p>
<p>The 733 references for neurological assessment, the 520 references for functional outcome, and the 1050 citations for pain following SCI were imported into a database, and duplicates were eliminated. Articles germane to each of the 3 topics were selected by reviewing their titles and abstracts. Additional references were culled from the reference lists of the remaining papers. Finally, members of the author group were asked to contribute articles known to them on the subject matter that were not found by other search means.</p></div>

<p>On occasion, the assessed quality of the study design was so contentious and the conclusions so uncertain that the guideline authors assigned a lower medical evidence classification than might have been expected without such a detailed review.

<p>Articles that did not achieve immediate consensus among the author group were discussed extensively until a consensus was reached. Very few contributions required extensive discussion.

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
