Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure estimates a hospital-level 30-day risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) for patients discharged from the hospital with either a principal diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or a principal diagnosis of respiratory failure and secondary diagnosis of COPD with exacerbation. Mortality is defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the start of the index admission.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annually reports the measure for individuals who are 65 years and older and are Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals (including Indian Health Services hospitals) and critical access hospitals.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Measurement of patient outcomes allows for a more comprehensive view of quality of care, encompassing more than that captured by individual process-of-care measures. Complex and critical aspects of care, such as communication between providers, prevention of and response to complications, patient safety, and coordinated transitions to the outpatient environment, all contribute to patient outcomes but are difficult to measure by individual processes (Krumholz et al., 2007; Bradley et al., 2006). Clinical trials and observational studies suggest that several aspects of care provided to patients hospitalized for exacerbations of COPD can have significant effects on mortality, thus supporting the essential construct of mortality as an appropriate outcome to measure quality (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD], 2009; National Collaborating Centre for Acute and Chronic Conditions, 2010; Walters et al., 2009; Lightowler et al., 2003). </p>
<p>The goal of outcomes measurement is to evaluate patient outcomes after accounting for patients' conditions at the time of hospital admission (hospital case-mix). This mortality measure was developed to identify hospitals whose performance is better or worse than would be expected based on their patient case-mix, and therefore promote hospital quality improvement and better inform consumers about care quality.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a priority condition for outcomes measure development because it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. COPD affects at least 15 and as many as 24 million individuals in the United States (U.S.), and is the nation's third leading cause of death (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI], 2009; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011; Wier et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2013; American Lung Association, 2016). Studies report that in-hospital mortality rates for patients hospitalized for exacerbations of COPD range from 2% to 5% (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2009; Patil et al., 2003; Tabak et al., 2009; Lindenauer et al., 2006; Dransfield et al., 2008) and 30-day mortality rates range from 3% to 9% (Faustini et al., 2008; Fruchter &amp; Yigla, 2008; Lindenauer et al., 2013). </p>
<p>In 2011, COPD was one of the top 20 most expensive conditions treated in U.S. hospitals (Torio &amp; Andrews, 2013). It was also one of the top 20 most expensive conditions billed to Medicare, accounting for nearly $4,074,000 of total hospital charges billed to Medicare (Torio &amp; Andrews, 2013). </p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Assessment of Updated Models</strong></p>
<p>The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality measure estimates hospital-specific 30-day all-cause risk-standardized mortality rates (RSMRs) using a hierarchical logistic regression model. Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details. </p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models, using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each yea. </p>
<p>CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero. </p>
<p>The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.3 of the original measure documentation. </p>
<p><strong>COPD Mortality 2017 Model Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Frequency of COPD Model Variables </em></p>
<p>CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. The largest changes in the frequencies (those greater than 2% absolute change) include increases in Asthma (16.3% to 23.8%), Cardio-respiratory failure and shock (35.3% to 40.1%), Other psychiatric disorders (30.4% to 33.1%), Other respiratory disorders (56.9% to 64.2%), and Renal failure (32.9% to 35.0%). </p>
<p><em>COPD Model Parameters and Performance </em></p>
<p>Table 4.3.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.3.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the COPD mortality model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year period; the c-statistic remained constant at 0.72.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Risk-Adjustment Variables</strong></p>
<p>In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.</p>
<p>The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of healthcare that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum's (NQF's) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) mortality rates are higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables.</p>
<p>Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission. </p></div>
