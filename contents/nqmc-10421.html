Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) who have an optic nerve head evaluation during one or more office visits within 12 months.</p></div>
</div>

<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Changes in the optic nerve are one of two characteristics which currently define progression and thus worsening of glaucoma disease status (the other characteristic is visual field). There is a significant gap in documentation patterns of the optic nerve for both initial and follow-up care (Fremont et al., 2003), even among specialists (Lee et al., 2006).</p>
<p>Examination of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer provides valuable structural information about glaucomatous optic nerve damage. Visible structural alterations of the optic nerve head or retinal nerve fiber layer and development of peripapillary choroidal atrophy frequently occur before visual field defects can be detected. Careful study of the optic disc neural rim for small hemorrhages is important, since these hemorrhages can precede visual field loss and further optic nerve damage.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statement is quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represents the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>Ophthalmic Evaluation (American Academy of Ophthalmology [AAO], 2010)</p>
<p>In completing the elements in the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation, the ophthalmic evaluation specifically focuses on the following elements:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>History </li>
    <li>Visual acuity measurement </li>
    <li>Pupil examination </li>
    <li>Anterior segment examination </li>
    <li>Intraocular pressure measurement </li>
    <li>Gonioscopy </li>
    <li>Optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer examination </li>
    <li>Fundus examination </li>
</ul></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Opportunity for Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Studies have been undertaken to examine variations in patterns of care for patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) although there are limited studies specific to the examination of an optic nerve head. A 2003 study (American Academy of Ophthalmology [AAO], 2010) describes current patterns of care for POAG with a focus on processes of care highlighted within the AAO's Preferred Practice Patterns. The AAO recommends the preferred technique for optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer evaluation including magnified stereoscopic visualization (as with the slit-lamp biomicroscope). For this study, information was obtained on processes of care, clinical findings, and treatments related to initial evaluations for POAG and to subsequent evaluations by an eye care provider (ophthalmologist or optometrist) during the study period. Information obtained included whether an evaluation of the optic disc and nerve fiber layer and a photograph or drawing of the optic nerve head were performed at or up to 12 months before or 6 months after the first visit and whether a target intraocular pressure (IOP) level was specified at the first visit. Information for follow-up visits included whether IOP and slit-lamp examinations were performed.</p>
<p>At initial evaluation, 92% of patients received a slit-lamp examination, 93% received an evaluation of the optic disc or nerve fiber layer but only 53% received an optic nerve head photograph or drawing. 1% of patients had a target IOP level specified or documented. </p>
<p>At follow-up visits about 97% of patients had an IOP checked but only 82% had a slit-lamp examination. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA)-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) collaborated on several measure testing projects in 2012, 2013 and 2015 to ensure the Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Optic Nerve Evaluation, Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Documentation of Presence or Absence of Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy &ndash; Communication with the Physician Managing Ongoing Diabetes Care measures are reliable and evaluated for accuracy of the measure numerator, denominator and exception case identification. The testing projects were conducted utilizing electronic health record data and registry data. Parallel forms reliability and signal-to-noise reliability was tested.</p>
<p>Two sites participated in the parallel forms testing of the primary open-angle glaucoma measure. Site A was a physician-owned multi-location suburban practice in a large Midwestern city with four providers. Site B was a physician-owned multi-location practice with three providers.</p>
<p>Signal-to-noise reliability was assessed using 2013 data acquired from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Physician Quality Reporting System Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) database.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma &ndash; Optic Nerve Evaluation</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parallel Forms Reliability Testing (Site A and Site B)</span></p>
<p>There were 146 observations from two sites used for the denominator analysis. The kappa statistic value was found to be non-calculable resulting from the inability to divide by zero in the statistic formula when only one response was used.</p>
<p>Of the 146 observations that were initially selected, 146 observations met the criteria for inclusion in the numerator analysis. The kappa statistic value of 0.84 demonstrates almost perfect agreement between the automated report and reviewer. </p>
<p>Reliability: N, % Agreement, Kappa (95% Confidence Interval) <br />
Denominator: 146, 60.3%, 0.00 (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)* <br />
Numerator: 146, 93.8%, 0.84 (0.73-0.94) <br />
Exception: 146, 100.0%, Non-Calculable* (Non-Calculable, Non-Calculable)** </p>
<p class="Note">*Cannot calculate kappa statistics when only one response (Yes/Yes) was used, as this causes a divide-by-zero error in the statistic formula.</p>
<p class="Note">**This is an example of the limitation of the Kappa statistic. While the agreement can be 90% or greater, if one classification category dominates, the Kappa can be significantly reduced.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signal-to-Noise Reliability Testing</span></p>
<p>Reliability is the ratio of the physician-to-physician variance divided by the sum of the physician-to-physician variance plus the error variance specific to a physician. A reliability of zero implies that all the variability in a measure is attributable to measurement error. A reliability of one implies that all the variability is attributable to real differences in physician performance. Reliability testing was performed by using a beta-binomial model. The beta-binomial model assumes the physician performance score is a binomial random variable conditional on the physician&rsquo;s true value that comes from the beta distribution. The beta distribution is usually defined by two parameters, alpha and beta. Alpha and beta can be thought of as intermediate calculations to get to the needed variance estimates.</p>
<p>Reliability is estimated at two different points, at the minimum number of quality reporting events for the measure and at the mean number of quality reporting events per physician.</p>
<p>For this measure, the reliability at the minimum level of quality reporting events (10) was 0.72. The average number of quality reporting events for physicians included is 121.8. The reliability at the average number of quality reporting events was 0.97. </p>
<p>This measure has moderate reliability when evaluated at the minimum level of quality reporting events and high reliability at the average number of quality events.</p></div>
