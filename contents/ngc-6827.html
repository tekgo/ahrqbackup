<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information for Patients and Carers</span></strong></p>
<p>Offer patients and carers clear, consistent information and advice throughout all stages of their care. This should include the risks of surgical site infections, what is being done to reduce them and how they are managed.</p>
<p>Offer patients and carers information and advice on how to care for their wound after discharge.</p>
<p>Offer patients and carers information and advice about how to recognise a surgical site infection and who to contact if they are concerned. Use an integrated care pathway for healthcare-associated infections to help communicate this information to both patients and all those involved in their care after discharge.</p>
<p>Always inform patients after their operation if they have been given antibiotics.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preoperative Phase</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Preoperative Showering</strong></p>
<p>Advise patients to shower or have a bath (or help patients to shower, bath or bed bath) using soap, either the day before, or on the day of, surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Hair Removal</strong></p>
<p>Do not use hair removal routinely to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p>If hair has to be removed, use electric clippers with a single-use head on the day of surgery. Do not use razors for hair removal, because they increase the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p><strong>Patient Theatre Wear</strong></p>
<p>Give patients specific theatre wear that is appropriate for the procedure and clinical setting and that provides easy access to the operative site and areas for placing devices, such as intravenous cannulas. Consider also the patient's comfort and dignity.</p>
<p><strong>Staff Theatre Wear</strong></p>
<p>All staff should wear specific non-sterile theatre wear in all areas where operations are undertaken.</p>
<p><strong>Staff Leaving the Operating Area</strong></p>
<p>Staff wearing non-sterile theatre wear should keep their movements in and out of the operating area to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Decontamination</strong></p>
<p>Do not use nasal decontamination with topical antimicrobial agents aimed at eliminating <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> routinely to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Bowel Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Do not use mechanical bowel preparation routinely to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Jewelry, Artificial Nails, and Nail Polish</strong></p>
<p>The operating team should remove hand jewelry before operations.</p>
<p>The operating team should remove artificial nails and nail polish before operations.</p>
<p><strong>Antibiotic Prophylaxis</strong></p>
<p>Give antibiotic prophylaxis to patients before:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clean surgery involving the placement of a prosthesis or implant </li>
    <li>Clean-contaminated surgery </li>
    <li>Contaminated surgery </li>
</ul>
<p>*Also see recommendations 1.4.6.19, 1.4.6.20 and 1.4.6.21 in the <a href="/summaries/summary/36817/" title="Guideline #9032" target="_blank">NGC summary of NICE's guideline on caesarean section</a>.</p>
<p>Do not use antibiotic prophylaxis routinely for clean non-prosthetic uncomplicated surgery.</p>
<p>Use the local antibiotic formulary and always consider potential adverse effects when choosing specific antibiotics for prophylaxis.</p>
<p>Consider giving a single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis intravenously on starting anaesthesia. However, give prophylaxis earlier for operations in which a tourniquet is used.</p>
<p>Before giving antibiotic prophylaxis, consider the timing and pharmacokinetics (for example, the serum half-life) and necessary infusion time of the antibiotic. Give a repeat dose of antibiotic prophylaxis when the operation is longer than the half-life of the antibiotic given.</p>
<p>Give antibiotic treatment (in addition to prophylaxis) to patients having surgery on a dirty or infected wound.</p>
<p>Inform patients before the operation, whenever possible, if they will need antibiotic prophylaxis, and afterwards if they have been given antibiotics during their operation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intraoperative Phase</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hand Decontamination</strong></p>
<p>The operating team should wash their hands prior to the first operation on the list using an aqueous antiseptic surgical solution, with a single-use brush or pick for the nails, and ensure that hands and nails are visibly clean.</p>
<p>Before subsequent operations, hands should be washed using either an alcoholic hand rub or an antiseptic surgical solution. If hands are soiled then they should be washed again with an antiseptic surgical solution.</p>
<p><strong>Incise Drapes</strong></p>
<p>Do not use non-iodophor-impregnated incise drapes routinely for surgery as they may increase the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p>If an incise drape is required, use an iodophor-impregnated drape unless the patient has an iodine allergy.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Sterile Gowns</strong></p>
<p>The operating team should wear sterile gowns in the operating theatre during the operation.</p>
<p><strong>Gloves</strong></p>
<p>Consider wearing two pairs of sterile gloves when there is a high risk of glove perforation and the consequences of contamination may be serious.</p>
<p><strong>Antiseptic Skin Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the skin at the surgical site immediately before incision using an antiseptic (aqueous or alcohol-based) preparation: povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine are most suitable.</p>
<p>If diathermy is to be used, ensure that antiseptic skin preparations are dried by evaporation and pooling of alcohol-based preparations is avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Diathermy</strong></p>
<p>Do not use diathermy for surgical incision to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p><strong>Maintaining Patient Homeostasis</strong></p>
<p>Maintain patient temperature in line with 'Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia' (NICE clinical guideline 65).</p>
<p>Maintain optimal oxygenation during surgery. In particular, give patients sufficient oxygen during major surgery and in the recovery period to ensure that a haemoglobin saturation of more than 95% is maintained.</p>
<p>Maintain adequate perfusion during surgery.</p>
<p>Do not give insulin routinely to patients who do not have diabetes to optimise blood glucose postoperatively as a means of reducing the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p><strong>Wound Irrigation and Intracavity Lavage</strong></p>
<p>Do not use wound irrigation to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p>Do not use intracavity lavage to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p><strong>Antiseptic and Antimicrobial Agents before Wound Closure</strong></p>
<p>Do not use intraoperative skin re-disinfection or topical cefotaxime in abdominal surgery to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p><strong>Wound Dressings</strong></p>
<p>Cover surgical incisions with an appropriate interactive dressing at the end of the operation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postoperative Phase</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Changing Dressings</strong></p>
<p>Use an aseptic non-touch technique for changing or removing surgical wound dressings.</p>
<p><strong>Postoperative Cleansing</strong></p>
<p>Use sterile saline for wound cleansing up to 48 hours after surgery.</p>
<p>Advise patients that they may shower safely 48 hours after surgery.</p>
<p>Use tap water for wound cleansing after 48 hours if the surgical wound has separated or has been surgically opened to drain pus.</p>
<p><strong>Topical Antimicrobial Agents for Wound Healing by Primary Intention</strong></p>
<p>Do not use topical antimicrobial agents for surgical wounds that are healing by primary intention to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.</p>
<p><strong>Dressings for Wound Healing by Secondary Intention</strong></p>
<p>Do not use Eusol and gauze, or moist cotton gauze or mercuric antiseptic solutions to manage surgical wounds that are healing by secondary intention.</p>
<p>Use an appropriate interactive dressing to manage surgical wounds that are healing by secondary intention.</p>
<p>Refer to a tissue viability nurse (or another healthcare professional with tissue viability expertise) for advice on appropriate dressings for the management of surgical wounds that are healing by secondary intention.</p>
<p><strong>Antibiotic Treatment of Surgical Site Infection and Treatment Failure</strong></p>
<p>When surgical site infection is suspected (i.e., cellulitis), either <em>de novo</em> or because of treatment failure, give the patient an antibiotic that covers the likely causative organisms. Consider local resistance patterns and the results of microbiological tests in choosing an antibiotic.</p>
<p><strong>Debridement</strong></p>
<p>Do not use Eusol and gauze, or dextranomer or enzymatic treatments for debridement in the management of surgical site infection.</p>
<p><strong>Specialist Wound Care Services</strong></p>
<p>Although there is no direct evidence to support the provision of specialist wound care services for managing difficult to heal surgical wounds, a structured approach to care (including preoperative assessments to identify individuals with potential wound healing problems) is required in order to improve overall management of surgical wounds. To support this, enhanced education of healthcare workers, patients and carers, and sharing of clinical expertise will be required.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Original Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Initial scoping searches were executed to identify relevant guidelines (local, national and international) produced by other development groups. The reference lists in these guidelines were checked against subsequent searches to identify missing evidence.</p>
<p>Relevant published evidence to inform the guideline development process and answer the clinical questions was identified by systematic search strategies. The clinical questions are presented in Appendix B of the original guideline document. Additionally, stakeholder organisations were invited to submit evidence for consideration by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) provided it was relevant to the topics included in the scope and of equivalent or better quality than evidence identified by the search strategies.</p>
<p>Systematic searches to answer the clinical questions formulated and agreed by the GDG were executed using the following databases via the 'Ovid' platform: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) (1950 onwards), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE) (1980 onwards) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 onwards). The most recent search conducted for the three Cochrane databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [CDSR], and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE]) was undertaken in quarter 1, 2008. Searches to identify economic studies were undertaken using the above databases and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED).</p>
<p>Search strategies combined relevant controlled vocabulary and natural language in an effort to balance sensitivity and specificity. Unless advised by the GDG, searches were not date specific. Language restrictions were applied to searches, and publications in languages other than English were not appraised. Both generic and specially developed methodological search filters were used appropriately.</p>
<p>There was no systematic attempt to search grey literature (conferences, abstracts, theses and unpublished trials). Hand searching of journals not indexed on the databases was not undertaken.</p>
<p>Searches were conducted during a 7 month period between September 2007 and April 2008. Evidence published after this date has not been included in the guideline. September 2007 should thus be considered the starting point for searching for new evidence for future updates to this guideline.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2011 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health undertook a review of this guideline in 2011 and determined that the information is current. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Searches</strong></p>
<p>The literature was searched to identify studies and reviews relevant to the scope. Searches were conducted of the following databases, covering the dates 13 April 2011 (the end of the search period for the latest review of the need to update NICE clinical guideline 74) to 8 January 2013:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

</ul>
<p>Table 1 of the Evidence Update (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provides details of the MEDLINE search strategy used (based on the search strategy for the reference guidance), which was adapted to search the other databases listed above. The search strategy was used in conjunction with validated Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network search filters for RCTs and systematic reviews.</p>
<p>Additionally, 1 study (Edmiston et al., 2013) was identified outside of the literature search.</p>

<p><strong>Synthesis of Clinical Effectiveness Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Evidence relating to clinical effectiveness was reviewed using established guides and classified using the established hierarchical system (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). This system reflects the susceptibility to bias that is inherent in particular study designs.</p>
<p>The type of clinical question dictates the highest level of evidence that may be sought. In assessing the quality of the evidence, each study was assigned a quality rating coded as '++', '+' or '&minus;'. For issues of therapy or treatment, the highest possible evidence level (EL) is a well-conducted systematic review or meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs; EL = 1++) or an individual RCT (EL = 1+). Studies of poor quality were rated as '&minus;'. Usually, studies rated as '&minus;' should not be used as a basis for making a recommendation, but they can be used to inform recommendations. For issues of prognosis, the highest possible level of evidence is a cohort study (EL = 2). A level of evidence was assigned to each study appraised during the development of the guideline.</p>
<p>For each clinical question, the highest available level of evidence was selected. Where appropriate, for example if a systematic review, meta-analysis or RCT existed in relation to a question, studies of a weaker design were not considered. Where systematic reviews, meta-analyses and RCTs did not exist, other appropriate experimental or observational studies were sought.</p>
<p>Clinical evidence for individual studies was extracted into evidence tables and a brief description of each study was included in the guideline text. The body of evidence identified for each clinical question was synthesised qualitatively in clinical evidence statements that accurately reflected the evidence. Quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) was performed for this guideline where sufficient numbers of similar studies were identified to merit such analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>An Evidence Update Advisory Group (EUAG), comprising topic experts, reviewed the prioritised evidence obtained from the literature search and provided their opinion on whether the new evidence may have a potential impact on the current guidance (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and developed in accordance with the guideline development process outlined in the NICE <em>Technical Manual</em>. This has included giving registered stakeholder organisations the opportunity to comment on the scope of the guideline at the initial stage of development and on the evidence and recommendations at the concluding stage.</p>

<p>The guideline was developed by a multi-professional and lay working group (the Guideline Development Group or GDG) convened by the National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health (NCC-WCH). Membership included:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Two surgeons</li>
<li>A tissue viability nurse</li>
<li>Two microbiologists</li>
<li>A theatre nurse</li>
<li>A surveillance coordinator</li>
<li>An infection control specialist</li>
<li>Two patient/carer representatives</li></ul>

<p><strong>Forming and Grading Recommendations</strong></p>

<p>For each clinical question, recommendations for clinical care were derived using, and linked explicitly to, the evidence that supported them. In the first instance, informal consensus methods were used by the GDG to agree clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence statements. Statements summarising the GDG's interpretation of the evidence and any extrapolation from the evidence used to form recommendations were also prepared. In areas where no substantial clinical research evidence was identified, the GDG considered other evidence-based guidelines and consensus statements or used their collective experience to identify good practice. The health economics justification in areas of the guideline where the use of National Health Service (NHS) resources (interventions) was considered was based on GDG consensus in relation to the likely cost-effectiveness implications of the recommendations. The GDG also identified areas where evidence to answer their clinical questions was lacking and used this information to formulate recommendations for future research.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the guideline development process, formal consensus methods were used to consider all the clinical care recommendations and research recommendations that had been drafted previously. The GDG identified ten key priorities for implementation (key recommendations), which were those recommendations expected to have the biggest impact on care and outcomes for adults and children undergoing surgical incisions through the skin.</p>

<p>The GDG also identified five key priorities for research, which were the most important research recommendations.</p></div>

<h3>
Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The aims of the economic input to the guideline were to inform the Guideline Development Group (GDG) of potential economic issues relating to the prevention and treatment of surgical site infection (SSI) and its complications, and to ensure that recommendations represented cost-effective use of healthcare resources.</p>

<p>The GDG prioritised a number of clinical questions where it was thought that economic considerations would be particularly important in formulating recommendations. A systematic search for published economic evidence was undertaken for these questions. For economic evaluations, no standard system of grading the quality of evidence exists and included papers were assessed using a quality assessment checklist based on good practice in decision-analytic modelling. Reviews of the very limited relevant published economic literature are presented alongside the clinical reviews or as part of appendices detailing original economic analyses.</p>

<p>Health economic considerations were aided by original economic analysis undertaken as part of the development of the guideline where robust clinical effectiveness data were available and UK cost data could be obtained. For this guideline, the areas prioritised for economic analysis were:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Hair removal (Section 5.2 in the original guideline document)</li>
<li>Nasal decontamination (Section 5.6 in the original guideline document)</li>
<li>Wound dressings (Section 6.12 in the original guideline document).</li></ul>

<p>The results of each economic analysis are summarised briefly in the guideline text with full cost-effectiveness models presented in Appendices D&#8211;G in the original guideline document.</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Healthcare Commission assesses how well National Health Service (NHS) organisations meet core and developmental standards set by the Department of Health in 'Standards for better health' (available from <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk" target="_blank" title="UK Department of Health Web site">www.dh.gov.uk</a>). Implementation of clinical guidelines forms part of the developmental standard D2. Core standard C5 says that NHS organisations should take into account national agreed guidance when planning and delivering care.</p>

<p>NICE has developed tools to help organisations implement this guidance (listed below). These are available on our website (<a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/CG74" target="_blank" title="NICE Web site">www.nice.org.uk/CG74</a>; see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Slides highlighting key messages for local discussion.</li>
<li>A costing statement to help estimate the costs and savings involved in implementing this guideline.</li>
<li>Audit support for monitoring local practice.</li></ul>

<p><strong><u>Key Priorities for Implementation (Key Recommendations)</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Information for Patients and Carers</strong></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Offer patients and carers clear, consistent information and advice throughout all stages of their care. This should include the risks of surgical site infections, what is being done to reduce them and how they are managed.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Preoperative Phase</strong></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Do not use hair removal routinely to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.</li>
<li>If hair has to be removed, use electric clippers with a single-use head on the day of surgery. Do not use razors for hair removal, because they increase the risk of surgical site infection.</li>
<li>Give antibiotic prophylaxis to patients before:

<ul type="disc">
<li>Clean surgery involving the placement of a prosthesis or implant</li>
<li>Clean-contaminated surgery</li>
<li>Contaminated surgery</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Do not use antibiotic prophylaxis routinely for clean non-prosthetic uncomplicated surgery.</li>
<li>Use the local antibiotic formulary and always consider potential adverse effects when choosing specific antibiotics for prophylaxis.</li>
<li>Consider giving a single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis intravenously on starting anaesthesia. However, give prophylaxis earlier for operations in which a tourniquet is used.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Intraoperative Phase</strong></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Prepare the skin at the surgical site immediately before incision using an antiseptic (aqueous or alcohol-based) preparation: povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine are most suitable.</li>
<li>Cover surgical incisions with an appropriate interactive dressing at the end of the operation.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Postoperative Phase</strong></p>

<p><em>Dressings for Wound Healing by Secondary Intention</em></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Refer to a tissue viability nurse (or another healthcare professional with tissue viability expertise) for advice on appropriate dressings for the management of surgical wounds that are healing by secondary intention.</li></ul></div>
