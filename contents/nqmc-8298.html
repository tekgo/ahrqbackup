<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the proportion of outpatients with a Medical Research Council (MRC) level of 2 or more, long-acting bronchodilator inhaled therapy and a forced expiratory volume within the first second of expiration (FEV<sub>1</sub>) equal to or below 60% of predicted value who are treated with inhaled steroids.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Medical treatment is an important part of the treatment of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The intensity of the treatment depends on the level of lung function, the severity of the shortness of breath and the frequency of any exacerbations. Inhalation of long-acting bronchodilators (long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA] or long-acting beta2 agonist [LABA]) has a positive effect on lung function, shortness of breath, functional level and may reduce the tendency for exacerbations. In patients with a forced expiratory volume within the first second of expiration (FEV<sub>1</sub>) below 60% of predicted value and/or frequent exacerbations inhaled bronchodilators are often supplemented with inhaled corticosteroids.</p></div>
