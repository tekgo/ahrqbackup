<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Pharyngitis is the only condition among upper respiratory infections (URIs) where diagnosis is validated easily and objectively through administrative and laboratory data, and it can serve as an important indicator of appropriate antibiotic use among all respiratory tract infections. Overuse of antibiotics has been directly linked to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance; promoting judicious use of antibiotics is important to reducing levels of antibiotic resistance (Gonzales et al., 2001). Pediatric clinical practice guidelines (Schwartz et al., 1998) recommend that only children diagnosed with group A streptococcus (strep) pharyngitis, based on appropriate lab tests, be treated with antibiotics. A strep test (rapid assay or throat culture) is the definitive test of group A strep pharyngitis. Excess use of antibiotics is highly prevalent for pharyngitis: about 35 percent of the total 9 million antibiotics prescribed for pharyngitis in 1998 were estimated to be in excess (Seppala et al., 1997).</p></div>

Once NCQA establishes national benchmarks for accountable care organization (ACO) performance, all measures will undergo formal reliability testing of the performance measure score using beta-binomiol statistical analysis. Where applicable, measures also are assessed for construct validity using the Pearson correlation test.</p></div>
