Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) lobectomy for lung cancer composite score measures surgical performance for elective lobectomy in patients with lung cancer. To assess overall quality, the composite comprises the following two domains: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><em>Domain 1 &ndash; Operative Mortality</em>: Operative mortality is defined as death before hospital discharge or within 30 days of the operation. </li>
    <li><em>Domain 2 &ndash; Major Complications</em>: Major complications are defined as one or more of the following: pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopleural fistula, pulmonary embolus, initial ventilator support greater than 48 hours, reintubation/respiratory failure, tracheostomy, myocardial infarction, or unexpected return to the operating room. </li>
</ul>
<p>Participants receive a score for each of the two domains, plus an overall composite score. The composite score was calculated as a weighted sum of (1 minus the risk-standardized mortality rate) and (1 minus the risk-standardized morbidity rate). Mortality and morbidity were weighed inversely by their respective standard deviations across participants. This procedure is equivalent to first re-scaling mortality and complications by their respective standard deviations and then assigning equal weighting to the re-scaled mortality rate and rescaled complication rate. Based on standard deviations derived from the data, the final composite measure was defined as 0.81 x risk-standardized mortality rate + 0.19 x risk-standardized complication rate. </p>
<p>Outcome data are collected on all patients and from all participants. For optimal measure reliability, participants meeting a volume threshold of at least 30 cases over 3 years receive a score for each of the two domains, plus an overall composite score. The overall composite score is created by "rolling up" the domain scores into a single number. In addition to receiving a numeric score, participants are assigned to rating categories designated by the following: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>1 star &ndash; lower-than-expected performance </li>
    <li>2 stars &ndash; as-expected performance </li>
    <li>3 stars &ndash; higher-than-expected performance </li>
</ul></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) General Thoracic Surgery Database (GTSD) has risk adjustment models for morbidity and mortality following lung cancer resection and prolonged length of stay following lobectomy. Because lobectomy for cancer is the most commonly performed major general thoracic surgical procedure in the GTSD, an expert panel of general thoracic surgeons selected lobectomy for its first thoracic quality measure. The lobectomy composite was designed as a two‐domain measure including risk-adjusted mortality and major complications. This methodology mirrors the development of several STS adult cardiac surgery composite measures. The lobectomy for lung cancer composite measure adds considerable value to the GTSD, as it is used for quality assessment, provider feedback, and performance improvement.</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>General Thoracic Surgery Database (GTSD) participating sites are randomly selected for participation in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) GTSD Audit, which is designed to evaluate the accuracy, consistency, and comprehensiveness of data collection and ultimately validate the integrity of the data contained in the database. Telligen, formerly the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care, has conducted audits on behalf of STS since 2006. In 2015, ten percent of randomly selected STS GTSD participants (N = 25, an increase from 24 in 2014 and 18 in 2013) were audited. The audit process involves re‐abstraction of data for 20 cases records (at least 15 lobectomy and up to 5 esophagectomy) and comparison of 40 STS GTSD V2.2 individual data elements with those submitted to the data warehouse. Agreement rates are calculated for each variable, each variable category and overall. In 2015, the overall aggregate agreement rate was 97.02%, demonstrating that the data contained in the STS GTSD are both comprehensive and highly accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis</strong> </p>
<p>Aggregate agreement rates were computed for all facilities by calculation of the sum of all facilities' numerators divided by the sum of all facilities' denominators, for each individual variable, each variable category and overall. </p>
<p>Chi-square statistics were calculated to identify any possible relationships between the data collection process variables and agreement rates. Tests where the chi-square statistic had a probability of less than 5% (p less than 0.05) were considered to show statistically significant differences in agreement rate between the levels of the process measure. </p>
<p><strong>Agreement Rate Results </strong></p>
<p>Database validity was evaluated by re-abstraction of defined variables from the medical records and comparison to submitted data. Agreement rates were calculated at the individual variable level, category level and overall. Aggregate agreement rates are presented in the table in the original measure documentation. There were 14,854 total variables abstracted and of those 14,412 variables matched, resulting in an overall agreement rate of 97.02%. </p>
<p><strong>Process Variable Correlation Tables </strong></p>
<p>The relationships between process variables and overall agreement rates were examined and included: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Facility data collection performed from electronic medical records or a combination of paper and electronic medical records and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Facility data collection method (concurrent/retrospective/both) and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Data collection performed by a single abstractor or multiple staff and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Attendance at the annual data managers' meeting, STS Advances in Quality and Outcomes (AQO) Conference, and overall agreement rate </li>
    <li>Agreed upon abstraction location for data elements documented in multiple locations and overall agreement rate </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Relationship between Data Collection Source &amp; Agreement Rate</em> </p>
<p>Facilities using an electronic health record (EHR) for data collection had higher agreement rates, 97.36%, than those facilities using both paper medical records and an EHR, 96.31%. There were no facilities that used paper medical records alone (p less than 0.0004). </p>
<p><em>Relationship between Data Collection Method &amp; Agreement Rate </em></p>
<p>Facilities collecting data retrospectively have higher agreement rates, 97.55%, than those facilities collecting data concurrently, 96.18%, or both, 96.38% (p equal to or less than 0.0001).</p>
<p><em>Relationship between Data Collection Performed by a Single Abstractor or Multiple Staff &amp; Agreement Rate </em></p>
<p>Facilities with a single individual performing data abstraction have higher agreement rates, 98.02%, than those facilities that have multiple individuals performing data abstraction, 96.24% (p less than 0.0001). </p>
<p><em>Relationship between Attendance at AQO Conference &amp; Agreement Rate</em> </p>
<p>Facilities having staff attend the annual AQO Conference have higher agreement rates, 97.25%, than those that do not have staff attend, 96.11% (p less than 0.0012). </p>
<p><em>Relationship between Have an Agreed Upon Location &amp; Agreement Rate </em></p>
<p>Facilities that utilize an agreed upon location for data elements recorded in multiple locations have higher agreement rates, 97.31%, than facilities that do not utilize an agreed upon location, 93.61% (p less than 0.0001). </p>
<p>In addition, validity is regularly assessed by an expert panel of general thoracic surgeons assembled by the STS General Thoracic Surgery Database Task Force, the STS Quality Measurement Task Force, and the STS Task Force on Quality Initiatives, all of which report to the STS Workforce on National Databases.</p>
<p><strong>The STS Composite Score for Rating Program Performance for Lobectomy for Lung Cancer</strong></p>
<p><em>Results</em></p>
<p>Table 4 of the original measure documentation (Kozower et al., 2016) illustrates the reliability for the lobectomy star ratings based on volume thresholds. Using the threshold volume of performing 30 lobectomies over the 3-year study period, the reliability of the STS lobectomy composite measure was 0.56 (95% Bayesian credible interval [CrI]: 0.45 to 0.66), similar to the reliability of the STS aortic valve replacement (AVR) plus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) measure, which was 0.51 (95% CrI: 0.46 to 0.55) (Shahian et al., 2014). Therefore, only programs performing a minimum of 30 lobectomies for lung cancer will be eligible for a star rating as there is insufficient information about the 25% of programs performing fewer than 10 lobectomies per year to provide them with a reliable star rating.</p>
<p>Table 5 of the original measure documentation (Kozower et al., 2016) shows the number of STS participants classified as high- (three-star), average- (two-star), or low- (one-star) performing centers using 80%, 90%, 95%, and 98% Bayesian CrI. Although there is no clear statistical criterion on which to base the choice of the most appropriate CrI, from a practical perspective the measure developers believe that 98% CrI provided higher specificity but inadequate differentiation among programs. Conversely, although the percentage of high- and low-performing programs was substantially larger with 80% CrI, there was insufficient certainty about the participant's classification to assure face validity. Based on these practical considerations and what the STS has done previously for their quality measures, the developers chose 95% CrI (corresponding to 97.5% Bayesian probability). This yielded 4.7% one-star programs (8 of 172) and 7.0% three-star programs (12 of 172), or nearly 11% overall high-performing or low-performing centers. This seemed an appropriate compromise between providing acceptable probability of accurate classification along with reasonable discrimination among programs. Table 6 of the original measure documentation (Kozower et al., 2016) demonstrates construct validity of the star ratings as the mortality and major complication rates decrease monotonically from one-star (below average) to three-star (above average) participants.</p>
