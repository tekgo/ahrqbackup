<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The levels of recommendation (1-3) and classification of evidence (I-III) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>When imaging is deemed necessary, multidetector computed tomographic (MDCT) scans with axial collimation should be used to screen for and diagnose, as MDCT scans are superior to plain films in identifying thoracolumbar spine (TLS) fractures. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Level 2 </strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Patients with back pain, TLS tenderness on examination, neurologic deficits referable to the TLS, altered mental status, intoxication, distracting injuries, or known or suspected high-energy mechanisms should be screened for TLS injury with MDCT scan. </li>
    <li>In blunt trauma patients with a known or suspected injury to the cervical spine, or any other region of the spine, thorough evaluation of the entire spine by MDCT scan should be strongly considered owing to a high incidence of spinal injury at multiple levels within this population. </li>
    <li>Patients without complaints of TLS pain that have normal mental status, as well as normal neurological and physical examinations may be excluded from TLS injury by clinical examination alone, without radiographic imaging, provided that there is no suspicion of high-energy mechanism or intoxication with alcohol or drugs. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered in consultation with the spine service for MDCT findings suggestive of neurologic involvement and of gross neurologic deficits. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Classes of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong>: Prospective randomized clinical trial.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong>: Prospective clinical studies or retrospective analyses based on reliable data such as cohort, observational, prevalence, or case-control studies.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong>: Retrospectively collected data based on database or registry review, case series, or expert opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong>: The recommendation is convincingly justifiable based on the available scientific information alone. This recommendation is usually based on Class I data; however, strong Class II evidence may form the basis for a Level 1 recommendation, especially if the issue does not lend itself to testing in a randomized format. Conversely, low-quality or contradictory Class I data may not be able to support a Level 1 recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong>: The recommendation is reasonably justifiable by available scientific evidence and strongly supported by expert opinion. This recommendation is usually supported by Class II data or a preponderance of Class III evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong>: The recommendation is supported by available data but adequate scientific evidence is lacking. This recommendation is generally supported by Class III data. This type of recommendation is useful for educational purposes and in guiding future clinical research.</p></div>

<p>A search of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health database and MEDLINE was performed using PubMed (<a href="http://www.pubmed.gov" title="PubMed Web site" target="_blank">www.pubmed.gov</a>). The search identified articles in the English language that addressed the screening or identification of thoracolumbar spinal (TLS) injury from March 2005 to December 2011. Articles that were categorized as review articles, letters to the editor, editorials, commentaries, and case reports were excluded from the query. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>

<p>Recommendations were then classified as Level 1, 2, or 3 according to definitions as defined by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) primer on evidence-based medicine (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2017 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>A comprehensive literature search was performed as referenced above. All articles were screened by title and abstract, and then all qualifying articles were reviewed by a single reviewer (SS). The final articles of relevance (N=4) were reviewed, of which 3 were additional support, including one large multi-institutional trial. The fourth article was a level IV retrospective study with specificity and sensitivity that were lower than acceptable to contradict the previous recommendations of this guideline without a focus on mechanism. Recent publications continue to support mechanism-based radiographic evaluation and the use of multi-detector computed tomographic (MDCT) scanning in comparison to physical exam or plain films for diagnosis of clinically significant thoracolumbar injury.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Practice Management Guidelines (PMGs) for the screening of thoracolumbar spine (TLS) injuries in blunt trauma were established to assist practitioners in the screening, diagnosis, and management of TLS injuries in blunt trauma patients. These are evidence-based guidelines that should be used in accordance with clinical judgment. Individual scenarios, resource availability, and clinical variations may need to be taken into consideration when determining ultimate screening algorithms. </li>
    <li>The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. </li>
    <li>"Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. </li>
