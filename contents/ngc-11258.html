<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence tables were compiled to summarize the findings of all included studies and organized by chemotherapy emetogenicity (minimal, low, moderate, and high) based on the pediatric emetogenicity classification guideline or, when this was not possible, by the chemotherapy emetogenicity classification used by the authors of the included studies. For studies where subjects received chemotherapy of different levels of emetogenicity (e.g., highly emetogenic chemotherapy [HEC] or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy [MEC]) and where study investigators did not report chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) control rates for these two groups separately, the extracted data were categorized under the lower emetogenicity level. </p>
<p>Evidence summaries of adverse events were restricted to those reported in included randomized trials, since adverse event reporting in these studies was more likely to be completed in a systematic fashion.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Recommendations were developed based on the evidence identified from the systematic reviews and refined through panel discussions. The associated potential health benefits versus risks were considered for each recommendation. Strong recommendations (i.e., most individuals should receive the recommended intervention) were made when the panel was certain that the potential benefits of the recommended intervention outweighed the risk of harm. Differences in opinion were resolved by consensus. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were assessed using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation system by one author and confirmed through discussion by the remaining panel members. If consensus could not be reached, a decision was made by the majority of panel members by a vote.</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Significant changes have been made to the recommendations in light of new evidence supporting the use of aprepitant and palonosetron in children. However, extensive evidence gaps remain. Continual appraisal of the evidence and prospective evaluation of patient outcomes that are achieved with the implementation of these recommendations are required. Furthermore, to ensure that control of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in children is optimized, future work must address critical evidence gaps. </li>
    <li>Aprepitant is not recommended for use in children less than 6 months of age because it has not been studied in this age group for the purpose of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) prophylaxis. </li>

Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Implementation Considerations</strong></span></p>
<p>While motivated by chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) control optimization and safety, the panel recognized that the cost of aprepitant and palonosetron may be a barrier to the implementation of these recommendations. In jurisdictions where cost is a barrier to using palonosetron 0.02 mg/kg/dose and compliance with the dose approved by regulatory authorities is not a concern, it may be reasonable to initiate palonosetron at the recommended dose with a patient's first chemotherapy block and, depending on the patients' CINV control, to administer a lower dose with a future chemotherapy block. Administration of ondansetron or granisetron may also be reasonable. Patient and institutional values, preferences and resources should be considered when implementing guideline recommendations.</p></div>
