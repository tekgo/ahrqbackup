<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Medication reconciliation is a critical piece of care coordination post-discharge for all individuals who use prescription medications. Prescription medication use is common among adults of all ages. On average, 82 percent of adults in the United States (U.S.) take at least 1 medication (prescription or nonprescription, vitamin/mineral, herbal/natural supplement); 29 percent take 5 or more.</p>
<p>Older adults are the biggest consumers of medications: 17 percent to 19 percent of people 65 and older take at least 10 medications in a given week (Slone Epidemiology Center, n.d.). Sixty-two percent of adults 65 and older have multiple chronic conditions; the higher number of chronic conditions they experience, the more providers are involved in their care. As the number of providers who are involved increases, the less likely patients are to understand, remember and reconcile the multiple instructions (Vogeli et al., 2007). Patients who have more than 1 chronic condition are likely to take more medications; therefore, ensuring proper medication reconciliation is imperative to preventing unintended complications.</p>
<p>The high prevalence of prescription medications can result in potentially negative consequences for patients if not used and monitored appropriately. Approximately 1.5 million preventable adverse drug events occur in the U.S. each year (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2007). Many of these result from medication errors, drug interactions or inappropriate use of medications.</p>
<p>Hospitalization is a specific risk event where medication errors may occur. Hospital medication records for admitted patients are often incomplete when they are admitted. A comparison of medication histories maintained by the hospital for admitted patients with community pharmacy records revealed that the hospital's records omitted 25 percent of the medications in use. As a result, patients are discharged from the hospital without being continued on some chronic medications (Lau et al., 2000)</p>
<p>Significant changes can occur to a patient's medications during hospitalization. A study by Beers et al. (1989) found that 45 percent of all discharge medications were initiated during hospitalization. Provider errors and patient misunderstanding of discharge medications is also common. One observational study found that 81.4 percent of patients experienced a provider error or had no understanding of at least one intended medication change upon discharge. Providers were more likely to make an error on a medication that was unrelated to the primary diagnosis, which emphasizes the importance of knowing the patient's current medications upon admission and discharge so that they are properly reconciled. Patients were more likely to misunderstand medication changes that were unrelated to the primary diagnosis, which stresses the importance of proper communication to the patient prior to and following discharge (Ziaeian et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Implementing routine medication reconciliation after discharge from an inpatient facility is an important step to ensuring that medication errors are addressed and patients understand new medications. The process of resolving discrepancies on a patient's medication list reduces the risk of adverse drug interactions being overlooked and helps physicians minimize duplication and complexity of a medication regimen, which in turn may increase patient adherence to the regimen and reduce hospital readmission rates (Wenger &amp; Young, 2004).</p></div>

Discharges for Medicare members age 18 years and older as of December 31 of the measurement year who had an acute or nonacute inpatient discharge on or between January 1 and December 1 of the measurement year. To identify acute and nonacute discharges:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Identify all acute and nonacute inpatient stays (Inpatient Stay Value Set) </li>
    <li>Identify the discharge date for the stay </li>

<p>The denominator for this measure is based on discharges, not members. If members have more than one discharge, include all discharges on or between January 1 and December 1 of the measurement year.</p>
<p><em>Readmission or Direct Transfer</em>: If the discharge is followed by a readmission or direct transfer to an acute or nonacute inpatient care setting on the date of discharge through 30 days after discharge (31 total days) count only the last discharge. To identify readmissions during the 31-day period: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Identify all acute and nonacute inpatient stays (Inpatient Stay Value Set) </li>
    <li>Identify the admission date for the stay (the admission date must occur during the 31-day period) </li>
    <li>Identify the discharge date for the stay (the discharge date is the event date) </li>
</ol>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Members must have been continuously enrolled from the date of discharge through 30 days after discharge (31 total days) with no gaps in enrollment. </p>
<p><strong>Exclusions</strong><br />
Exclude both the initial and the readmission/direct transfer discharges if the last discharge occurs after December 1 of the measurement year.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: If a member remains in an acute or nonacute facility through December 1 of the measurement year, a discharge is not included in the measure for this member, but the organization must have a method for identifying the member's status for the remainder of the measurement year, and may not assume the member remained admitted based only on the absence of a discharge before December 1.</p>
