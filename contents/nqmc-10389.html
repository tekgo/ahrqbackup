<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Hospital admission for childhood asthma often represents a failure to diagnose and proactively manage asthma in the home and at school through education, early detection and preventive medicine. Structures and processes of care associated with lower hospitalization rates in children for asthma include: compliance with evidence-based interventions aimed at the control of chronic asthma symptoms, the delivery of quality outpatient healthcare, and the control of asthma triggers (such as cigarette smoke followed by dust in the home, pet dander, and preventable exposures to other children with upper respiratory infections). Important to this issue is patient/family education. Follow-up clinical care is a key because it provides opportunities to address variations in patients' symptoms and severity, exposure to allergens, adherence, the management plan, and patient self-management. Poor compliance to follow-up visits (including either delays or no follow-up care) not only has a negative impact on pediatric admissions for asthma but also impacts overall quality of life for both the patient and family.</p>
<p>Many parents and patients lack the information they need to manage chronic asthma symptoms and to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations for pediatric asthma. Common problems with adherence include: lack or delay in symptom recognition and action, medications not being given soon enough, running out of medications, refills not being called in to pharmacies, and failure to avoid known triggers of the child's asthma exacerbations, including exposure to cigarette smoke. An essential component of preventing asthma exacerbations includes controlling asthma triggers. Trigger reduction is a particularly high priority for preventing hospitalizations in poor inner-city children with asthma. Studies have found that among low-income urban households with a child with asthma, 47% to 50% have smokers in the home, 34% have furry pets, and 47% to 58% have high levels of cockroach allergen. Although many parents are aware of asthma triggers, more than half of environmental actions by parents do not meet current guidelines and are unlikely to control triggers effectively. Home health evaluation, smoking cessation counseling, and working closely with patients and families either during an acute hospitalization or in the outpatient arena can help to lower environmental triggers.</p>
<p>In addition, clinical practice guidelines suggest that asthma can be managed in the home or outpatient setting; thus hospitalizations for asthma are preventable.</p>
<p>This measure is an avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) type indicator. ACSC type indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of potentially avoidable hospitalization if appropriate outpatient care, other healthcare services or community services were accessed and obtained (i.e., measures of the health care system broadly defined). These measures are designed to assess population access to timely, high quality outpatient and public health services in a particular geographic area, for the purpose of managing chronic disease or diagnosing acute illnesses before progressing to inpatient treatment. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), accountable care organizations (ACOs) or public health agencies. ACSC indicators correlate with each other and they may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a national, regional or county level.</p>
<p>The improvement in the measure equates to less hospitalizations for pediatric asthma. This result essentially means the population is experiencing greater control and better management of their asthma given the reduction in the rate acute asthma events. </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness, as well as a leading cause of childhood morbidity and one of the most common reasons for hospitalization in children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], n.d.; Akinbami &amp; Schoendorf, 2002; Fuhlbrigge et al., 2002; Stranges, Merrill, &amp; Steiner, 2008). In 2006, nearly 10% of children in the United States (U.S.) had a current diagnosis of asthma and 14% had a diagnosis at some point in their lives (Stranges, Merrill, &amp; Steiner, 2008). There were approximately 335,000 asthma-related hospitalizations among children in the U.S. in 2006, comprising 13.6% of all pediatric hospitalizations, representing is a significant health care expenditure (Stranges, Merrill, &amp; Steiner, 2008). Despite availability of asthma guidelines, quality of care provided to children hospitalized for asthma is suboptimal, especially with regard to initiation of chronic asthma control and prevention of asthma readmissions (Nkoy et al., 2008; Friday et al., 1997; Kattan, 2008; Cabana et al., 2003). Six-month hospital readmission rates for subsequent asthma attacks are reportedly as high as 40% (Minkovitz, Andrews, &amp; Serwint, 1999; Farber, 1998).</p>
<p>Asthma disproportionately affects low-income and minority children. A study using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Pediatric Quality Indicator (PDI) for asthma hospitalizations and 2001 to 2004 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) data reported hospitalization rates per 100,000 children aged 2 to 17 years varied by state ranging from 51.1 to 185.9 in the six geographically and diverse states studied (Knudson et al., 2009). Within these 6 states, authors reported that although rural children were the found to be most likely to be hospitalized for asthma, after controlling for rurality, poverty, uninsurance, and physician supply, uninsurance was the only variable to significantly impact hospitalization rates (Knudson et al., 2009). In addition, regional variation exists in the rate of hospitalizations for pediatric asthma with the Northeast being significantly higher than the West in 2011 (149.9 per 100,000 population vs 55.9 per 100,000 population, p less than .0001). Various explanations have been hypothesized for this variation, including differences in physician training, differences in practices, higher penetration of large managed care organizations or organizations that have implemented aggressive chronic disease management programs, and differences in environmental triggers. </p>
<p>Other studies report higher prevalence and hospitalization rates among minority children, especially those of low socioeconomic status in urban areas (Akinbami et al., 2009; Akinbami &amp; CDC National Center for Health Statistics, 2006; Akinbami, Moorman, &amp; Liu, 2011; Ernst et al., 1995; Gold &amp; Wright, 2005; Lang &amp; Polansky, 1994; Litonjua et al., 1999; Miller, 2000; Myers, 2000; Akinbami &amp; Schoendorf, 2002; Nicholas et al., 2005; Stranges, Merrill, &amp; Steiner, 2008; Hill, Graham, &amp; Divgi, 2011; Berdahl et al., 2010). For example, a study using 2005 inpatient discharge data from the HCUP found that compared with white and Asian Pacific Islander children, black and Hispanic children were more likely to have admissions for asthma (331.394 and 138.620 per 100,000 2- to 17-year-olds, respectively vs. 91.175 and 63.705 per 100,000 2- to 17-year-olds, respectively). Black children had at least 3 times the rate of asthma admissions than white children from every income group (Berdahl et al., 2010). </p>
<p>Universal health insurance coverage does not completely address the issue of disparities, as one study of Department of Defense dependents enrolled in TRICARE found that black children in all age groups and Hispanic children ages 5 to 10 years were significantly more likely to have an a potentially avoidable asthma hospitalization or emergency department visit (OR=1.24 to 1.99) than white children (Stewart et al., 2010). Further studies have focused on the interrelationship among hardship (caregivers looking for work, having no one to borrow money from, not owning a car or home and being single/never married), neighborhood characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, insurance coverage and racial disparities as explanations for higher asthma readmission rates among a subgroup of the population (Beck et al., 2014; Liu &amp; Pearlman, 2009). Others have pointed to significant environmental factors (pollution, tobacco exposure, housing quality) related to exacerbations of asthma as additional explanations for income and geographic disparities in hospitalizations (Shapiro &amp; Stout, 2002; Kuo et al., 2012). </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p>The developer's metric of reliability is the signal to noise ratio, which is the ratio of the between area variance (signal) to the within area variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). There is an area-specific signal to noise ratio, which is used as an Empirical Bayes univariate shrinkage estimator. The overall signal to noise ratio is a weighted average of the area-specific signal-to-noise ratio, where the weight is [1 / (signal + noise)^2]. The signal is calculated using an iterative method. The analysis reports the reliability of the risk-adjusted rate (before applying the empirical Bayes univirate shrinkage estimator).</p>
<p>Overall the risk-adjusted rate is strongly reliable. Based on a norm of a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.80, 80% of areas exceed the norm. Reliability is less than the norm in areas with population less than approximately 600 persons, meaning that the performance score is reliability adjusted closer to the shrinkage target in those areas.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p>The developer conducted construct validity testing to examine the association between the risk-adjusted rate and area structural characteristics potentially associated with quality of care, including prior performance, using regression analysis. Two area structural constructs (Access to health care and Market competition) were derived from a principal components factor analysis using data from the Area Health Resource File (AHRF) 2012 to 2013. The following five variables were examined in the factor analysis: physician density defined as the number of physicians in patient care per person, excess capacity defined as percent of available short-term general hospital beds per total beds, poverty status defined as the percent of persons in poverty, insurance status defined as the percent of persons (under 65) without health insurance and population density per square mile. Access to health care is primarily defined by insurance status and poverty, followed by lower physician density and higher excess capacity, which is consistent with the hypothesis that lower physician density and excess capacity would increase utilization. The second factor, market competition, is primarily defined by poverty and higher physician density, followed by higher population density.</p>
<p>Given the stated rationale, the expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "Less Access to High Quality Outpatient Care" construct validity measure (F1) and the area risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "More Market Competition" construct validity measure (F2) and the area risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The results are consistent with expectations. Also, past performance is a moderate predictor of current performance with a coefficient of 0.72.</p>

Description of Allowance for Patient or Population Factors
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The predicted value for each case is computed using a hierarchical model (logistic regression with area random effect) and covariates for gender and age (in age groups). The reference population used in the regression is the universe of discharges for states that participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Data (SID) for the year 2010 (combined), a database consisting of 44 states and approximately 5 million pediatric discharges, and the United States (U.S.) Census data by county. The expected rate is computed as the sum of the predicted value for each case divided by the number of cases for the unit of analysis of interest (i.e., area). The risk adjusted rate is computed using indirect standardization as the observed rate divided by the expected rate, multiplied by the reference population.</p>
