<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the total number of premature deaths that could potentially have been avoided through all levels of prevention (primary, secondary, tertiary) per 100,000 population younger than age 75 (potentially avoidable mortality). </p>
<p>Avoidable mortality refers to untimely deaths that should not occur in the presence of timely and effective health care, including prevention. It serves to focus attention on the portion of population health attainment that can potentially be influenced by the health system.</p>
<p><em>Calculation Description</em></p>
<p>Mortality rate: (Number of deaths at age younger than 75 from avoidable causes &divide; Total mid-year population younger than age 75) &times; 100,000 (age-adjusted) </p>
<p>Potential years of life lost (PYLL): (The sum of differences between 75 and age of death from avoidable causes &divide; Total mid-year population younger than age 75) &times; 100,000 (age-adjusted) </p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Avoidable mortality indicators provide additional insight into the Canadian health system. These measures can be used to assess the impact of prevention strategies and the outcomes of health policy decisions and health care provision. </p>
<p>Avoidable mortality indicators can serve to inform where Canada's health system has made gains and to point to where more work is needed. They can also help to quantify potential gains. For example, in an ideal world where all avoidable mortality in Canada has been eliminated, life expectancy at birth for the years 2006 to 2008 would have been 85.8 years&mdash;4.9 years longer than the actual life expectancy of 80.9 years. Three of the 4.9 years would be attributed to eliminating preventable mortality; the other 1.9 years would come from eliminating mortality from treatable causes. </p>
<p>Analysis of avoidable mortality highlights the need for prevention.</p></div>
