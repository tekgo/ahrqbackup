<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Excessive use of alcohol and drugs has a substantial harmful impact on health and society in the United States. It is a drain on the economy, and a source of enormous personal tragedy (National Quality Forum, 2007). In 1998 the economic costs to society were 185 billion dollars for alcohol misuse and 143 billion dollars for drug misuse (Harwood, 2000). Health care spending was 19 billion dollars for alcohol problems and 14 billion dollars was spent treating drug problems.</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars per year in lost productivity is attributable to substance use. More than 537,000 die each year as a consequence of alcohol, drug, and tobacco use, making use of these substances the cause of one out of four deaths in the United States (Mokdad et al., 2004). </p>
<p>An estimated 22.6 million adolescents and adults meet criteria for a substance use disorder. In a multi-state study that screened 459,599 patients in general hospital and medical settings, 23% of patients screened positive (Madras et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Clinical trials have demonstrated that brief interventions, especially prior to the onset of addiction, significantly improve health and reduce costs, and that similar benefits occur in those with addictive disorders who are referred to treatment (Fleming et al., 2002). </p>
<p>In a study on the provision of evidence-based care and preventive services provided in hospitals for 30 different medical conditions, quality varied substantially according to diagnosis. Adherence to recommended practices for treatment of substance use ranked last, with only 10% of patients receiving proper care (Gentilello et al., 2005). Currently, less than one in twenty patients with an addiction are referred for treatment (Gentilello et al., 1999).</p>
<p>Hospitalization provides a prime opportunity to address the entire spectrum of substance use problems within the health care system (Bernstein et al., 2005).</p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Twenty-four hospitals from nineteen states volunteered to participate in a six month pilot test of the draft measures, commencing with discharges beginning March 1, 2010 and concluding on July 31, 2010. There were three tests conducted during the development phase for this measure; public comment, survey of the pilot sites, and a Technical Advisory Panel (TAP) assessment. The purpose was threefold: to gather information regarding face validity, to determine feasibility of data collection, and to gather information about each data element regarding clarity and suggested enhancement that could be made. 2,177 persons responded to the public comment. A total of eleven hospitals and eight TAP members completed the evaluation. </p>
<p>The final phase of testing consisted of site visits to a sample of participating pilot hospitals to assess the reliability of data abstracted and reported by those hospitals. Reliability test site visits were conducted at nine randomly selected pilot hospitals. Selection of the test sites was based on multiple characteristics; including hospital demographics, populations served, bed size and type of facility. </p>
<p>All of the substance use (SUB) measures have undergone a rigorous process of public comment, alpha testing and broad-scale pilot testing and are recognized by the field as important indicators of substance abuse treatment. </p></div>
