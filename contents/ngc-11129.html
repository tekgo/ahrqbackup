<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is fair evidence that 3-D ultrasound, sonohysterography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are good diagnostic tests for distinguishing a septate and bicornuate uterus when compared with laparoscopy/hysteroscopy. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>It is recommended that imaging with hysteroscopy should be used to diagnose uterine septa rather than laparoscopy with hysteroscopy because this approach is less invasive (<strong>Grade B</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations of the Literature</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The data regarding reproductive implications of septate uteri and treatment effects are limited and comprised primarily of observational, principally descriptive studies without untreated control groups. </li>

<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Several observational studies indicate that hysteroscopic septum incision is associated with improved clinical pregnancy rates in women with infertility. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does a Septum Contribute to Pregnancy Loss or Adverse Pregnancy Outcome?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is fair evidence that a uterine septum contributes to miscarriage and preterm birth. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Some evidence suggests that a uterine septum may increase the risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes such as malpresentation, intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption, and perinatal mortality. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does Treating a Septum Improve Obstetrical Outcomes?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Some limited studies indicate that hysteroscopic septum incision is associated with a reduction in subsequent miscarriage rates and improvement in live-birth rates in patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Some limited studies indicate that hysteroscopic septum incision is associated with an improvement in live-birth rate in women with infertility or prior pregnancy loss. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>

<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Long After Surgical Treatment of a Uterine Septum Should a Woman Wait to Conceive?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Although the available evidence suggests that the uterine cavity is healed by 2 months postoperatively, there is insufficient evidence to advocate a specific length of time before a woman should conceive. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Should Preoperative Management to Thin the Endometrium Be Used?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is insufficient evidence for or against recommending danazol or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists to thin the endometrium prior to hysteroscopic septum incision. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is Adhesion Prevention Needed?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statement</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against adhesion prevention treatment, or any specific method following hysteroscopic septum incision. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>It is recommended that imaging or imaging with hysteroscopy should be used to diagnose uterine septa rather than laparoscopy with hysteroscopy because this approach is less invasive. (<strong>Grade B</strong>) </li>
    <li>In a patient with infertility, prior pregnancy loss, or poor obstetrical outcome it is reasonable to consider septum incision. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
    <li>In a patient without infertility or prior pregnancy loss, it may be reasonable to consider septum incision following counseling regarding potential risks and benefits of the procedure. (<strong>Grade C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized, controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>Level II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of Search</span></strong></p>
<p>This clinical practice guideline was based on a systematic review of the literature. Systematic literature searches of relevant articles were performed in the electronic database MEDLINE through PubMed in March and April 2015, with a filter for human subject research. No limit or filter was used for time period covered or English language, but articles were subsequently culled for English language.</p>
<p>A combination of the following medical subject headings or text words/keywords were used: abortion, adhesion, adhesions, arcuate, bicornuate, birth control pill, congenital anomalies, congenital anomaly, congenital abnormalities, congenital abnormality, contraceptive, danazol, detection, diagnose, diagnosis, hysterosalpingogram, hysteroscopic, hysteroscopy, infertility, intrauterine, laparoscopic, laparoscopy, live birth, Lupron, metroplasty, miscarriage, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), outcome, perinatal outcome, perinatal outcomes, pregnancies, pregnancy, pregnancy loss, premature, preterm, progestin, repair, resection, resectoscope, septa, septal, septate, septum, sonohysterogram, surgery, treatment, ultrasonography, uteri, uterine, uterus.</p>
<p>Initially, titles and abstracts of potentially relevant articles were screened and reviewed for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Protocols and results of the studies were examined according to specific inclusion criteria. Only studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed in the final analysis. Studies were eligible if they met one of the following criteria: primary evidence (clinical trials) that assessed the effectiveness of a procedure correlated with an outcome measure (pregnancy, implantation, or live-birth rates); meta-analyses; and relevant articles from bibliographies of identified articles.</p>
<p>Four members of an independent task force reviewed the full articles of all citations that possibly matched the predefined selection criteria. Final inclusion or exclusion decisions were made on examination of the articles in full. Disagreements about inclusion among reviewers were discussed and solved by consensus or arbitration after consultation with an independent reviewer/epidemiologist.</p>

<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is fair evidence that 3-D ultrasound, sonohysterography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are good diagnostic tests for distinguishing a septate and bicornuate uterus when compared with laparoscopy/hysteroscopy. </li>
    <li>Several studies indicate that treating a uterine septum is associated with an improvement in live-birth rates in women with a history of prior pregnancy loss, recurrent pregnancy loss, or infertility. </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There have been 18 case reports in the literature of uterine
rupture during pregnancy or delivery following septum incision. Risk of subsequent pregnancy-related uterine rupture
is correlated with excessive septal excision, penetration of the
myometrium, uterine wall perforation, and excessive use of
cautery or laser energy during the initial septum incision
procedure.</p></div>
