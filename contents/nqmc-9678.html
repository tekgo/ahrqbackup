Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of all emergency medical services (EMS) records for injured patients 18 years and older with documentation of needle decompression thoracostomy attempted prior to arrival in hospital (per 100 patients).</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: See the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC) summaries of the Quality of Trauma in Adult Care (QTAC) <a href="/browse/by-organization-indiv.aspx?orgid=2532&amp;objid=49235" title="Measure Subset">Invasive Prehospital Procedure Documentation Rate</a> measures. </p>
<p class="Note">This measure belongs to a subset of measures designed to monitor the rate of high-risk low-volume invasive prehospital procedures attempted, successfully performed and associated complications. For each of the following four procedures, three measures will be calculated: i) number of documented attempted procedures per 100 patients, ii) number of documented successful procedures per 100 patients and iii) number of documented complications per 100 patients:</p>
<ul class="Note" style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Intubation (NQMC-9672; NQMC-9673; NQMC-9674) </li>
    <li>Cricothyroidotomy (NQMC-9675; NQMC-9675; NQMC-9677) </li>
    <li>Needle decompression thoracostomy (NQMC-9678; NQMC-9679; NQMC-9680) </li>
    <li>Defibrillation (NQMC-9681; NQMC-9682; NQMC-9683) </li>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Each year, injuries affect 700 million people worldwide and result in more than five million deaths. In many countries, injuries are the leading cause of death among those under the age of 45 years. The human and societal burden is even greater with many survivors never returning to school, work or their "regular" lives. </p>
<p>Health care services provide patients with treatment for what is a major cause of morbidity and death. Yet medical errors and substandard care threaten trauma care. Half of all patients with major traumatic injuries do not receive recommended care, medical errors are common in critically ill trauma patients and preventable trauma deaths in hospital are widely reported. The World Health Organization (WHO), professional trauma organizations (e.g., American College of Surgeons [ACS], Trauma Association of Canada and Royal Australasian College of Surgeons) and accreditation bodies have promoted efforts to improve the quality of care delivered to injured patients. However, before the quality of injury care can be improved, it needs to be measured using reliable and valid measures of health care quality.</p>
<p>These indicators can be used to assess patient safety, and to evaluate and improve quality of care by incorporating these measures into local, regional or national quality improvement efforts. Implementing a consistent approach to measurement (same indicators, same definitions, same data elements, same reporting format) would provide institutions with reliable performance data that is necessary for surveillance (e.g., tertiary survey completion), to track local problems (e.g., adverse events &ndash; specifically missed injuries), evaluate the effects of interventions or program changes (e.g., tertiary survey protocol) and provide comparisons across centers (e.g., benchmarking adverse events using programs such as the ACS's Trauma Quality Improvement Program). Well-designed, carefully evaluated and appropriately implemented quality indicators (QIs) may be essential tools for guiding efforts to improve health and healthcare.</p>
<p>This indicator belongs to a subset of measures intended to monitor the rate of high-risk low-volume invasive prehospital procedures attempted, successfully performed and associated complications. </p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Using a modification of the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Methodology, a panel of 19 injury and quality of care experts serially rated and revised quality indicators identified from a systematic review of the literature and international audit of trauma center quality improvement practices. The quality indicators developed by the panel were sent to 133 verified trauma centers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for evaluation.</p>
<p>A total of 84 quality indicators were rated and revised by the expert panel over 4 rounds of review producing 31 quality indicators of structure (n=5), process (n=21), and outcome (n=5), designed to assess the safety (n=8), effectiveness (n=17), efficiency (n=6), timeliness (n=16), equity (n=2), and patient-centeredness (n=1) of injury care spanning prehospital (n=8), hospital (n=19), and posthospital (n=2) care and secondary injury prevention (n=1). A total of 101 trauma centers (76% response rate) rated the indicators (1=strong disagreement, 9=strong agreement) as targeting important health improvements (median score 9, interquartile range [IQR] 8 to 9), easy to interpret (median score 8, IQR 8 to 9), easy to implement (median score 8, IQR 7 to 8), and globally good indicators (median score 8, IQR 8 to 9).</p>
<p>Thirty-one evidence-informed quality indicators of adult injury care were developed, shown to have content validity, and can be used as performance measures to guide injury care quality improvement practices.</p>
<p>Trauma centers rated the indicator "percentage of all emergency medical services (EMS) records for injured patients 18 years and older with documentation of needle decompression thoracostomy attempted prior to arrival in hospital" as targeting important health improvements (median score 8, IQR 8 to 9), easy to interpret (median score 8, IQR 7 to 9), easy to implement (median score 7, IQR 6 to 9), and globally a good indicator (median score 8, IQR 7 to 9).</p></div>
