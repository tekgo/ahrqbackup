<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Clinicians may choose to offer shunting as a treatment for patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) in order to treat their subjective symptoms of iNPH and gait (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Because there is a risk of significant adverse events (AEs), the risks and benefits of the procedure should be carefully weighed (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians should inform patients with iNPH with elevated R<sub>o</sub> that they have an increased chance of responding to shunting compared with those without such elevation (<strong>Level B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians may counsel patients with iNPH that an abnormal CSF infusion test (CSF-IT) or a positive response to repeated lumbar punctures (LPs) increases the chance of response to shunting (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians may counsel patients with iNPH and their families that increasing age does not necessarily decrease the chance of a shunt being successful (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Clinicians may counsel patients with suspected iNPH and with impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) reactivity to acetazolamide, measured by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), that they are possibly more likely to respond to shunting (<strong>Level C</strong>). </li>

<p><strong>A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The panel performed an initial search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Database from 1980 to September 2012, limited to English-language publications, using the search terms ("normal pressure hydrocephalus" or "NPH" or "adult hydrocephalus syndrome" or "hydrocephalus") and ("shunting" or "treatment") and ("trial" or "outcome" or "predictors" or "response") and "neurosurgery." The search identified 438 citations. The panel performed an updated search of MEDLINE and Cochrane from 2012 to November 2013 using ("normal pressure hydrocephalus" or "NPH") and filtering manually with terms of initial search. Subsequent to this update, 2 additional relevant studies were published and are included. The panel excluded case reports, editorials, meta-analyses, review articles, duplicative reports, and articles regarding only secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), including fewer than 10 patients with idiopathic NPH (iNPH) or suspected iNPH (as smaller numbers would lack statistical power), using no comparison group, or following patients for response to therapy for less than 3 months. At least 2 reviewers working independently of each other screened each of the remaining abstracts for relevance. If discordant conclusions could not be resolved by consensus, the panel included a third reviewer. Two panelists reviewed in detail the articles considered relevant to either of the questions, using pre-established criteria for relevance.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Each article was classified according to the American Academy of Neurology's (AAN's) classification schemes for therapeutic (2011) and prognostic (2004) articles (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Table e-1 in the data supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) presents studies rated above Class IV (with one exception).</p>
<p>Many included studies lacked generalizability because patients, while representing a typical clinical spectrum, were preselected for surgery on the basis of tests other than the ones being studied. In these studies, the panel upgraded or downgraded certain therapeutic and prognostic conclusions using the formal AAN-modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology (see tables e-2 and e-3 in the data supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In November 2010, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee formed a panel of experts to develop this guideline according to the processes outlined in the 2004 AAN process manual, with 2 exceptions: the 2011 AAN process manual was used in the approach to developing conclusions and the therapeutic classification of evidence scheme subsequently updated from the 2011 AAN process manual was used (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The panel systematically reviewed the literature regarding the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The panel asked 2 questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>What is the efficacy of ventricular shunting for iNPH (therapeutic question)? </li>
    <li>Are there reliable clinical or laboratory predictors of a successful outcome of shunting (prognostic question) (efficacy and successful outcome both defined as a persistent, objectively demonstrable, and clinically meaningful improvement after shunting)? </li>
</ol>
<p>The panel linked recommendations directly to the evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).</p></div>

</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Shunting is possibly effective in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), with a 96% chance of subjective improvement, and a 83% chance improvement on the timed walk test at 6 months.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Shunting is associated with potential morbidity and mortality. One review found a pooled mean shunt complication rate of 38% and an overall combined rate of permanent neurologic deficit and death of 6%. Another publication reported mortality rates between 5% and 15% for the shunting procedure. In the recently reported SINPHONI multicenter trial, 22% of shunted patients experienced significant adverse events (AEs). In addition to the costs of hospitalization and surgery, patients with implanted shunts are at risk of shunt failure, ventriculitis, and shunt infections. The prolonged lumbar drainage diagnostic procedure is associated with a risk of meningitis and death of 1.8%&ndash;3.6% and 0.2%, respectively. Several more recent studies describe complication rates of 15% to 28%.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. The AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, a network of neurologists, <em>Neurology</em> peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.aan.com" title="AAN Web site">www.aan.com</a>.
