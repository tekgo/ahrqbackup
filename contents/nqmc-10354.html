<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Screening for specific medical conditions may direct the therapy. Although the clinical guidelines and supporting evidence calls for an evaluation of many factors, it was felt that for the purposes of measuring performance and facilitating implementation this initial measure must be limited in scope. For this reason, the work group defined an evaluation of balance and gait as a core component that must be completed on all patients with a history of falls as well as four additional evaluations &ndash; at least one of which must be completed within the 12 month period.</p>
<p><strong>The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure</strong>:</p>
<p>Older people who present for medical attention because of a fall, or report recurrent falls in the past year, or demonstrate abnormalities of gait and/or balance should be offered a multifactorial falls risk assessment. This assessment should be performed by a health care professional with appropriate skills and experience, normally in the setting of a specialist falls service. This assessment should be part of an individualized, multifactorial intervention (National Institute for Clinical Excellence [NICE], 2004).</p>
<p>Multifactorial assessment may include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Identification of falls history </li>
    <li>Assessment of gait, balance and mobility, and muscle weakness </li>
    <li>Assessment of osteoporosis risk </li>
    <li>Assessment of the older person's perceived functional ability and fear relating to falling </li>
    <li>Assessment of visual impairment </li>
    <li>Assessment of cognitive impairment and neurological examination </li>
    <li>Assessment of urinary incontinence </li>
    <li>Assessment of home hazards </li>
    <li>Cardiovascular examination and medication review (NICE, 2004) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>American Geriatrics Society (AGS) updated guideline (AGS &amp; British Geriatrics Society [BGS], 2010) (verbatim)</strong>:</p>
<p>A fall risk assessment should be performed for older persons who present for medical attention because of a fall, report recurrent falls in the past year, report difficulties in walking or balance or fear of falling, or demonstrate unsteadiness or difficulty performing a gait and balance test.</p>
<p>The falls risk evaluation should be performed by a clinician with appropriate skills and experience.</p>
<p>A falls risk assessment is a clinical evaluation that should include the following, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A history of fall circumstances </li>
    <li>Review of all medications and doses </li>
    <li>Evaluation of gait and balance, mobility levels and lower extremity joint function </li>
    <li>Examination of vision </li>
    <li>Examination of neurological function, muscle strength, proprioception, reflexes, and tests of cortical, extrapyramidal, and cerebellar function </li>
    <li>Cognitive evaluation </li>
    <li>Screening for depression </li>
    <li>Assessment of postural blood pressure </li>
    <li>Assessment of heart rate and rhythm </li>
    <li>Assessment of heart rate and rhythm, and blood pressure responses to carotid sinus stimulation if appropriate </li>
    <li>Assessment of home environment </li>
</ul>
<p>The falls risks assessment should be followed by direct intervention on the identified risk (AGS &amp; BGS, 2010).</p></div>
