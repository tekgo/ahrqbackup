    <li>The subcommittee may make further revisions to the draft guideline based on public input and any other information they have received. This then results in a fourth draft. </li>
    <li>The fourth draft is presented to the full advisory committee in an open public meeting. Oral comments are invited from the public, and the full committee may recommend further changes, potentially creating a fifth and final draft. </li>
    <li>Once the full committee makes the advisory recommendation to adopt the guideline, it becomes final and is again posted on the web and distributed via the provider listserv. </li>

Completion of a nerve conduction study for a presumptive case of CTS is required if time loss extends beyond two weeks or if surgery is requested.</p></div>

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Most guidelines are implemented within the utilization review (UR) program. Labor and Industries (L&amp;I) guidelines have priority over other proprietary guidelines and criteria that may exist. Where L&amp;I guidelines are not available, proprietary ones may be used. Reviewers apply each guideline as a standard for the majority of requests in the Washington workers' compensation program. For the minority of workers who appear to fall outside of the guideline and whose complexity of clinical findings exceeds the specificity of the guideline, further review by a physician is conducted.</p>
<p>When a surgical procedure is requested for a patient who meets the guideline criteria, the reviewer will recommend approval to the claim manager. If the criteria are not met, the request will be referred to a physician consultant who will review the patient's file, offer to discuss the case with the requesting physician, and make a recommendation to the claim manager. The flexibility built into this decision making process is important in two ways. First, it enables the Washington State Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee (IIMAC) to develop surgical indications fairly quickly. Second, it plays a major role in legitimizing the work of the subcommittee in the eyes of practicing physicians in Washington.</p>
<p>Completed guidelines will be communicated to practicing physicians via L&amp;I's website and through its provider listserv (<a href="http://www.lni.wa.gov/Main/Listservs/Provider.asp" title="WSDLI Web site" target="_blank">http://www.lni.wa.gov/Main/Listservs/Provider.asp</a>). Education and training will be provided to reviewers and staff to ensure their proper application within the UR program. Where possible, continuing medical education (CME) credits may be offered.</p></div>
