<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Excerpts (verbatim) from guidelines</em>:<br />
&hellip;[C]linical trials&hellip;remain the hallmark of management for this disease. Progress toward improving management of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has occurred over the past few years and more such advances are anticipated using these guidelines as a framework for coordination of comparative clinical trials (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2016).</p></div>

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) conducted an analysis of the results of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) chart abstraction done since the tool was released in 2006 (~1400 patients). Performance for this measure was 45.7%. Since 2013, performance for this measure was 54% for 203 patients.</p></div>
