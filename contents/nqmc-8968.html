<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients ages 2 through 17 years who have an annual body mass index (BMI) screening who have received education and counseling regarding weight management strategies.</p>
<p>Childhood obesity has risen at an alarming pace over the past decade, making obesity the most prevalent health problem among children in the majority of the developed countries. Since 1980, obesity prevalence among children and adolescents in the United States has almost tripled. One in three children (31.7%) is overweight or obese and approximately 17% (or 12.5 million) of children and adolescents 2 to 19 years of age are obese.</p>
<p>The causes of obesity are complex and multifactorial. Research on childhood obesity has demonstrated the role of race, ethnicity and social factors such as family income, family structure, and neighborhood safety and amenities. Studies show links between environmental influences, genetics, age, sleep and medication, bottle versus breastfeeding, comorbidities and social relationships, as well as health behaviors such as eating patterns, physical activity levels and screen time. In addition to individual traits and behaviors, the recent rise in obesity on a national level can be attributed to societal changes in eating habits, food and beverage availability, and less-active lifestyles, which has shifted the balance of energy intake and expenditure.</p>
<p>This societal shift has implications for the health of a generation. Childhood obesity is associated with major morbidity. Moreover, it is linked to obesity in adulthood and is a predictor of significant health consequences in early adulthood. Multiple studies have shown that the risk of adult obesity is at least twice as high for obese children as for non-obese children. One study showed that as many as 80% of 10 to 15-year-old overweight children become obese adults.</p>
<p>The body of research linking obesity in childhood to short- and long-term health consequences and obesity in adulthood is increasing. Obesity is associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, atheroma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Concern is growing for the future health of our nation, the economic burden and the effect obesity will have on our health care system.</p>
<p>While this problem spans all age ranges, childhood obesity can be considered unique in its diagnostic, treatment and follow-up considerations. Identification and early intervention of overweight and obesity is critical in preventing or delaying the onset of chronic diseases.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There are significant racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence among United States (U.S.) children and adolescents. Children are more racially and ethnically diverse than the nation's population as a whole, and obesity prevalence rates are highest in this group. Mexican-American and African-American children ages 6 to 11 are more likely to be obese or overweight than white children. Almost 43% of Mexican-American children and almost 37% of African-American children are obese or overweight, compared with about 32% of white children. For two to four year olds, the highest rates of obesity are found in American Indian and Alaska Native (20.7%) and Hispanic (17.9%) children. In 2007 to 2008, Hispanic boys ages 2 to 19 years were significantly more likely to be obese than non-Hispanic white boys, and non-Hispanic black girls were significantly more likely to be obese than non-Hispanic white girls. </li>
    <li>The burden of obesity is greater for lower socioeconomic groups. Children living in families under 200% of the Federal Poverty Level are more likely than their more affluent counterparts to be overweight or at risk for being overweight. Children covered by Medicaid are nearly six times more likely to be treated for a diagnosis of obesity than children covered by private insurance (1,115 per 100,000 vs. 195 per 100,000). Low income families have greater obstacles to overcome in addressing the problem of obesity. Often due to limited finances, transportation and other barriers, low-income families have less access to healthy food choices and safe, affordable opportunities for physical activity for their children. </li>
</ul>
