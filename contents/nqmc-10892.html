Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected oral health patients with a Phase 1 treatment plan that is completed within 12 months.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related morbidity and mortality has dropped dramatically due to advances in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment. But reductions are uneven across HIV-infected populations due to unequal access to care and variable quality of services provided. Quality management seeks to enhance the quality of HIV care provided and increase access to services. They do so by measuring how health and social services meet established professional standards and user expectations.</p>
<p>Oral diseases are progressive and cumulative and can affect our ability to eat, the foods we choose, how we look, and the way we communicate. These diseases can affect economic productivity and compromise our ability to work at home, at school, or on the job. Health disparities exist across population groups at all ages. Over one third of the United States (U.S.) population (100 million people) has no access to community water fluoridation. Over 108 million children and adults lack dental insurance, which is over 2.5 times the numbers who lack medical insurance (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2000).</p>
<p>Community and migrant health center oral health programs seek to increase access to oral health care for the underserved. This performance measure addresses two fundamental areas within community and migrant health center oral health programs: 1) the need to perform a comprehensive oral health exam that culminates with an accompanying treatment plan and 2) assuring that quality care is incorporated in the process of completing needed treatment in a timely manner. The measure facilitates the identification of contributing and restricting factors and practical low cost improvement options relevant to significant areas listed above. </p>
<p>With access to codes associated with comprehensive oral exams and patient treatment completion (PTC), most management information systems will be able to provide an average length of time associated with completion of treatment. With this information, staffing patterns, financial costs (overhead expenses) and efficiency of the oral health program can be assessed. These additional benchmarks could also be measured across health center programs at the local, regional and national levels. The ultimate goal is to measure and assure that health centers routinely and systematically deliver comprehensive, quality oral health services and patient treatment is completed within a reasonable amount of time. </p>
<p>The performance measure is comprehensive in that subsequent performance analysis can broach a number of significant areas, such as: appointment scheduling, ratio of oral health providers to dental operatories, ratio of oral health providers to support staff, collaboration with medical colleagues emphasizing oral health as an essential component of an interdisciplinary approach to patient care, prioritization of patients and/or procedures, general productivity and efficiency.</p></div>
