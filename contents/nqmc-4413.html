Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of venous ulcer who were prescribed compression therapy within the 12 month reporting period.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Compression therapy is fundamental to promote healing and prevent recurrence of ulcers in patients with venous abnormality. Although it has proven efficacy, research has shown that it is not universally used in the treatment of patients with venous ulcers. One study found that one third of patients did not receive compression of any sort and there was great variability in the level and type of compression therapy used.  Graduated high compression (greater than 30 mmHg) produces the best results. However, some compression is better than no compression.</p>

<p class="Note">The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <u>verbatim</u> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:</p>

<p class="Note">For patients with venous hypertension or risk for venous insufficiency, consider graduated compression stockings. (American Society of Plastic Surgeons [ASPS], 2007)</p>

<p class="Note">The use of a Class 3 (most supportive) high-compression system (three layer, four layer, short stretch, paste-containing bandages, e.g., Unna's boot, Duke boot) is indicated in the treatment of venous ulcers. Although these modalities are similar in effectiveness, they can differ significantly in comfort and cost. The degree of compression must be modified when mixed venous/arterial disease is confirmed during the diagnostic work-up. Intermittent pneumatic pressure (IPC) can be used with or without compression dressings and can provide another option in patients who cannot or will not use a compression adequate dressing system. (Wound Healing Society [WHS], 2006)</p>

<p class="Note">Compression therapy heals more venous leg ulcers than no compression therapy as well as decreases the healing time. High compression is more effective than low compression, but there are no differences in the effectiveness of the different types of products available for high compression. (Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses Society [WOCN], 2005)</p>

<p class="Note"><u>Compression options</u></p>

<ul style="font-size:8pt;">
<li>Elastic compression bandage heals more than inelastic compression</li>
<li>Multi-layer (2, 3, or 4 layers) sustained, elastic high-compression bandage</li>
<li>Elastic high-compression stockings to heal venous ulcers</li>
<li>Elastic multiple-layer high-compression stockings to heal venous ulcers</li>
<li>Duke Boot or Unna Boot + elastic compression</li>
<li>Gradient compression better than uniform compression</li>
<li>Short stretch bandage</li>
<li>Unna boot zinc paste impregnated bandage</li>
<li>Intermittent pneumatic compression</li>
<li>Non-elastic compression with Circaid [or similar device]</li>
<li>Sequential-gradient pneumatic compression (Association for the Advancement of Wound Care [AAWC], 2005)</li>
