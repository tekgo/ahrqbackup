Potential Benefits

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Monitoring vital signs during a physical therapy treatment session to ensure children and adolescents are below the lactate threshold, are within target heart rate, and are within safe ranges of systolic and diastolic blood pressure may allow greater tolerance to exercise. With monitoring vital signs, the therapist will be able to track if certain exercises are increasing vital signs too rapidly and in turn, decrease the ability of the patient to perform the exercise. With the therapist monitoring the vital signs and subjective rate of perceived exertion (RPE), the therapist can ensure that the patient's physiological and psychological response is within an appropriate range for the goal of the treatment session.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>This Best Evidence Statement addresses only key points of care for the target population; it is not intended to be a comprehensive practice guideline. These recommendations result from review of literature and practices current at the time of their formulation.

This document is not intended to impose standards of care preventing selective variances from the recommendations to meet the specific and unique requirements of individual patients.

<h2>Implementation of the Guideline
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Description of Implementation Strategy
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Applicability Issues</strong></p>
<p>Vital signs can be used to monitor tolerance of exercise and guide outpatient physical therapy treatment for children and adolescents that are overweight or obese. For example, if a patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate rise unexpectedly and their rate of perceived exertion (RPE) is higher than the goal for that treatment session, a rest break may be warranted or a change in level of exercise to return vital signs to the patient's baseline level. With monitoring vital signs, the therapist will be able to track if certain exercises are increasing vital signs too rapidly and in turn, decrease the ability of the patient to perform the exercise. With the therapist monitoring the vital signs and subjective RPE, the therapist can ensure that the patient's physiological and psychological response is within an appropriate range for the goal of the treatment session.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost</span>: There may be cost associated with obtaining manual blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, or electronic (oscillating) blood pressure devices and training staff to use a RPE scale.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Staff Education</span>: Physical therapists and physical therapist assistants are currently trained in vital sign measurement through their Master or Doctor of Physical Therapy programs or their physical therapist assistant program as part of the requirements established by their governing organization, the American Physical Therapy Association. Physical therapists will need to be trained in administering and monitoring a RPE scale.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equipment</span>: Examples of equipment needed include an oscillometric machine (e.g., Dinamap), electronic forearm blood pressure cuff, or manual blood pressure cuff with stethoscope. Obese children and adolescents may need an adult size blood pressure cuff or a thigh cuff to ensure a good fit and accurate measurement.</p></div>
