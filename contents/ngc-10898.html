<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A</strong>,<strong> B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>,<strong> U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I</strong>-<strong>IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Practice Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>
<p>Prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d has significant benefit in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) management and should be considered the optimal prednisone dose. Prednisone 10 mg/kg/weekend is equally effective over a 12-month period, although long-term outcomes of this alternate regimen remain to be seen. Because of the expectation of significant adverse events (AEs) with corticosteroids, proper informed consent is required, and AEs should be discussed with patients and their families prior to therapy initiation and should be managed proactively. The American College of Rheumatology Task Force osteoporosis guideline recommends calcium and vitamin D supplementation for patients taking corticosteroids (any dose with an anticipated duration of &ge;3 months) in order to maintain a total calcium intake of 1,200 mg/d and vitamin D intake of 800 IU/d through dietary sources and supplementation.</p>
<p>If a significant number of AEs develop, reducing the prednisone dose to 0.3 mg/kg/d may reduce the AE burden, albeit with less efficacy.</p>
<p>The AE profiles of deflazacort and prednisone vary slightly. Weight gain and cushingoid appearance may occur more frequently with prednisone than deflazacort, but cataracts are more frequently reported with deflazacort.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Prednisone, offered as an intervention for patients with DMD:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Should be used to improve strength (<strong>Level B</strong>) and may be used to improve timed motor function (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Should be used to improve pulmonary function (<strong>Level B</strong>) </li>
    <li>May be used to reduce the need for scoliosis surgery (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>May be used to delay the onset of cardiomyopathy by 18 years of age (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>Deflazacort, offered as an intervention for patients with DMD, may be used to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Improve strength and timed motor function and delay the age at loss of ambulation by 1.4&ndash;2.5 years (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Improve pulmonary function (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Reduce the need for scoliosis surgery (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Delay the onset of cardiomyopathy by 18 years of age (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Increase survival at 5 and 15 years of follow-up (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>Deflazacort and prednisone may be equivalent in improving motor function (<strong>Level C</strong>). There is insufficient evidence to establish a difference in effect on cardiac function (<strong>Level U</strong>). Prednisone may be associated with increased weight gain in the first years of treatment compared with deflazacort (<strong>Level C</strong>). Deflazacort may be associated with increased risk of cataracts compared with prednisone (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>If patients with DMD are treated with prednisone, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d should be the preferred dosing regimen (<strong>Level B</strong>). Prednisone 10 mg/kg/weekend is equally effective over 12 months, but long-term outcome is not yet established. Prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d is probably associated with significant risk of weight gain, hirsutism, and cushingoid appearance (<strong>Level B</strong>), with equal side effect profile seen over 12 months with the 10 mg/kg/weekend dosing.</p>
<p>Prednisone 0.3 mg/kg/d may be used as an alternative dosing regimen with lesser efficacy and fewer AEs (<strong>Level C</strong>). Prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/d is another alternative regimen; it may be equivalent to 0.75 mg/kg/d but may be associated with more AEs (<strong>Level C</strong>).</p>
<p>Data are insufficient to support or refute the following (<strong>all Level U</strong>):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The addition of calcifediol and bisphosphonates (alendronate) as significant interventions for improving bone health in patients with DMD taking prednisone </li>
    <li>A benefit of bisphosphonates for improving survival in patients with DMD taking corticosteroids </li>
    <li>A benefit of prednisone for survival </li>
    <li>A significant difference in efficacy or AE rates among daily, alternate day, and intermittent regimens for prednisone or prednisolone dosing </li>
    <li>A preferred dose of deflazacort </li>
    <li>An effect of corticosteroids on quality of life (QoL) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Counseling</strong></p>
<p>The following suggestions for counseling are the opinion of the authors and extend from logical conclusions of the recommendations.</p>
<p>Patients with DMD and their families should:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Have a voice in the choice of the corticosteroid used, noting that the various corticosteroids differ in evidence supporting use, cost, availability, and AE profiles. When a corticosteroid has been agreed upon, a focused discussion of the risks particular to that corticosteroid should take place. </li>
    <li>Be informed of the risks and benefits of adding a bisphosphonate to corticosteroid treatment. </li>
</ul>

<div class="content_para"><p>The panel searched MEDLINE for articles published from January 2004 through June 2012 (see appendix e-3 in the full guideline [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field] for the search strategy). They performed update searches covering July 2012 through April 2013 and May 2013 through July 2014. The panel searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Science Citation Index, and references of selected articles and review articles.</p>
<p>The panel reviewed the titles and abstracts of the identified citations for relevance to the clinical questions and retrieved the full text of potentially relevant articles. They also included the Class I&ndash;III trials from the original guideline. The panel excluded trials with fewer than 10 patients.</p>
<p>The searches identified 757 citations. The panel reviewed the full text of 121 potentially relevant articles.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict of Interest</span></strong></p>
<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical, and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest to influence the recommendations of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. The AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guideline have been reviewed by at least 3 AAN committees, a network of neurologists, <em>Neurology </em>peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at <a href="https://www.aan.com/" title="AAN Web site">www.aan.com</a>. For complete information on this process, access the 2004 AAN process manual.</p>
