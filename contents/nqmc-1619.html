<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Asthma is a chronic lung condition that increasingly is being recognized as a major international public health challenge. But although asthma is a chronic respiratory disease, much can be done to manage the symptoms. Never before have we had so many good, safe oral and inhaled drugs for the treatment of asthma as we do today. Evidence-based guidelines have been proven to be effective in improving the daily lives of patients with this disease.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, despite our progress, we know that many individuals with asthma still suffer unnecessarily from the symptoms of disease. Guideline implementation lags in many practices across the country. In a healthcare system designed around acute care, chronic illnesses including asthma are not managed as effectively as they could be. Translating research into practice is not as easy as it sounds, even when we know it is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The Asthma Collaborative is designed to help healthcare providers improve the care they provide to people with asthma. Focusing on specific measures that are based on clinical guidelines, practices concentrate on changes that truly make a difference. By providing tools and proven strategies to change the way asthma care is delivered, the Asthma Collaborative has improved the lives of thousands with asthma.</p>

<p>This measure is one of 11 measures that participants track in the HRSA Health Disparities Collaborative for Asthma.</p></div>

Association with Vulnerable Populations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>In the U.S., rates of asthma deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits have been increasing for more than two decades, especially among African Americans and children. Since 1979–82, the average age-adjusted asthma death rate for blacks has increased 71 percent versus 41 percent for Caucasians, and in 1995–98, the death rate was almost three times that of Caucasians.</p>

<p>Similarly, between 1992 and 1998, rates of emergency department visits for asthma increased, with the greatest increase in children ages 10–17. Children under 5 accounted for the highest rates of emergency department visits. Hospitalization rates also rose during this time period. Between 1979–81 and 1997–99, hospitalization rates for children under 5 increased 48 percent. In 1997–99, hospitalization rates were more than three times higher for African Americans than for whites.</p></div>
