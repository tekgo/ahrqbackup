<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (<strong>I&ndash;III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>A&ndash;C</strong>) are defined at the end of "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based primarily on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Based on efficacy and adverse effect profile, evidence-based protocols for medical abortion are superior to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimen. Vaginal, buccal, and sublingual routes of misoprostol administration increase efficacy, decrease continuing pregnancy rates, and increase the gestational age range for use as compared with the FDA-approved regimen. </li>
    <li>Regimens that use low doses of mifepristone (200 mg) have similar efficacy and lower costs compared with to those that use mifepristone at 600 mg. </li>
    <li>Women can safely and effectively self-administer misoprostol at home as part of a medical abortion regimen. </li>
    <li>Medical abortion also can be provided safely and effectively by nonphysician clinicians. </li>
    <li>Follow-up after receiving mifepristone and misoprostol for medical abortion is important, although an in-clinic evaluation is not always necessary. </li>
    <li>Misoprostol-only medical abortion regimens are significantly less effective than those that use a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based primarily on limited scientific evidence (Level B):</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Because teratogenicity of medical abortifacients becomes an important issue if the pregnancy continues, patients must be counseled before medical abortion treatment of the need for a surgical abortion in the event of a continuing pregnancy. </li>
    <li>Before medical abortion is performed, gestational age should be confirmed by clinical evaluation or ultrasound examination. </li>
    <li>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, are not contraindicated in women who undergo a medical abortion and are appropriate first-line agents for pain management. </li>
    <li>Buccal administration of misoprostol may result in a lower risk of serious infection compared with vaginal administration. </li>
    <li>Medical abortion can be provided safely and effectively via telemedicine with a high level of patient satisfaction; moreover, the model appears to improve access to early abortion in areas that lack a physician health care provider. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C):</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Women who undergo medical abortion may need to access emergency surgical intervention, and it is medically appropriate to provide referral to another health care provider. However, state or local laws may have additional requirements. </li>
    <li>Clinicians who wish to provide medical abortion services either should be trained in surgical abortion or should be able to refer to a clinician trained in surgical abortion. </li>
    <li>No strong data exist to support the universal use of prophylactic antibiotics for medical abortion. </li>
    <li>Rhesus (Rh) testing is standard of care in the United States, and RhD immunoglobulin should be administered if indicated. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong>&mdash;Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong>&mdash;Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 2000 to November 2013. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician-gynecologists were used.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Bleeding and cramping will be experienced by most women undergoing medical abortion and are necessary for the process to occur. </li>
    <li>Adverse effects commonly associated with mifepristone use include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and thermoregulatory effects (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). The incidence of each adverse effect is based on the regimen used (especially the prostaglandin analogue), the dose and route of administration of the prostaglandin analogue, and the gestational age. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are less common when misoprostol is administered vaginally as compared with regimens that use oral, buccal, or sublingual misoprostol. Buccal and sublingual administration cause similar adverse effects, with the sublingual route associated with a higher rate of chills. </li>
    <li>Overall, large series demonstrate that less than 1% of women will need emergency curettage because of excessive bleeding. Moreover, the risk of clinically significant bleeding and transfusion may be lower in women who undergo medical abortion of gestations up to 49 days compared with those who undergo medical abortion of gestations of more than 49 days; this risk will vary based on the regimen used. </li>
    <li>Because teratogenicity of medical abortifacients becomes an important issue if the pregnancy continues, patients must be counseled before medical abortion treatment of the need for a surgical abortion in the event of a continuing pregnancy. </li>
    <li>The overall risk of serious infection with medical abortion is very low and buccal administration of misoprostol may result in a lower risk of serious infection compared with vaginal administration. </li>
    <li>Women are not good candidates for medical abortion if they are unable or unwilling to adhere to care instructions, desire quick completion of the abortion process, are not available for follow-up contact or evaluation or cannot understand the instructions because of language or comprehension barriers. </li>

Contraindications
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Most studies of medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol exclude women with anemia who have hemoglobin levels of less than 9.5 g/dL or less than 10 g/dL; accordingly, the safety of medical abortion in women with anemia is unknown. Other medical contraindications to abortion with mifepristone regimens include confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine device (IUD) in place, current long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy, chronic adrenal failure, known coagulopathy or anticoagulant therapy, and intolerance or allergy to mifepristone. </li>
    <li>Misoprostol should not be used in women who have an allergy or intolerance to misoprostol or other prostaglandins. </li>
