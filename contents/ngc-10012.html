Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The quality of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and classification of recommendations (<strong>A-E, L</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The definition of small-for-gestational age for a fetus in utero is an estimated fetal weight that measures &lt;10th percentile on ultrasound. This diagnosis does not necessarily imply pathologic growth abnormalities, and may simply describe a fetus at the lower end of the normal range. (<strong>III</strong>) </li>
    <li>Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) refers to a fetus with an estimated fetal weight &lt;10th percentile on ultrasound that, because of a pathologic process, has not attained its biologically determined growth potential. (<strong>III</strong>) A clinical estimation of fetal weight or symphysis-fundal height has poor sensitivity and specificity and should not be relied upon to diagnose IUGR. IUGR should be considered in the differential diagnosis when the fetus is found to be small for gestational age. (<strong>II-1</strong>) </li>
    <li>Effective screening for IUGR requires accurate dating and includes a review of the mother's menstrual history, relevant assisted reproductive technology information, and either a first trimester or early second trimester dating ultrasound. (<strong>I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Symphysis-fundal height determination is of limited value in routine obstetrical care, but continues to be the only physical examination screening test available. (<strong>I</strong>) </li>
    <li>Fetal weight determination in fetuses between the 10th and 90th percentiles by ultrasound biometry alone has at least a 10% error rate across gestation, but is effective equally when measuring with abdominal circumference alone or in combination with head size (biparietal diameter or head circumference) and/or femur length to establish an estimated fetal weight. (<strong>II-2</strong>) </li>
    <li>Determining whether IUGR is symmetric or asymmetric is of less clinical importance than careful re-evaluation of fetal anatomy and uterine and umbilical artery Doppler studies. (<strong>I</strong>) </li>
    <li>In women with risk factors for IUGR, uterine artery Doppler screening at 19 to 23 weeks may identify pregnancies at risk of antepartum stillbirth and preterm delivery due to IUGR and placental disease. (<strong>II-2</strong>) </li>
    <li>In pregnancies in which IUGR due to uteroplacental vascular insufficiency is diagnosed, maternal surveillance for the development of severe preeclampsia with adverse features is warranted. (<strong>II-1</strong>) </li>
    <li>Once surveillance of a fetus with IUGR is instituted, umbilical artery Doppler studies and biophysical profile scoring can be used as short-term predictors of fetal well-being. (<strong>I</strong>) </li>
    <li>In the presence of abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies, further investigation of the fetal circulatory system by Doppler examination of the middle cerebral artery, ductus venosus, and umbilical vein can be considered. (<strong>II-2</strong>) </li>
    <li>For a fetus with IUGR, the decision for obstetrical intervention, including Caesarean section, in cases of abnormal fetal heart rate or malpresentation is largely based on fetal viability, as assessed by ultrasound. (<strong>II-2</strong>) </li>
    <li>Maternal surveillance for the development of preeclampsia is warranted. (<strong>II-2</strong>) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Women should be screened for clinical risk factors for IUGR by means of a complete history. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Women should be counseled on smoking cessation at any time during pregnancy. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>First and second trimester screening tests for aneuploidy maybe useful tests of placental function. If two screening test results are abnormal, health care providers should be aware that the fetus is at increased risk of preterm IUGR and associated stillbirth. (<strong>II-1A</strong>) </li>
    <li>If IUGR is suspected, further assessment can assist in making the diagnosis. If available, detailed ultrasound examination of the placenta (looking for evidence of a small, thickened placenta, or abnormal morphology) and uterine artery Dopplers should be considered at 19 to 23 weeks. In the absence of available diagnostic testing, closer surveillance should be offered. A maternal-fetal medicine consultation can be considered if the placenta appears abnormal on ultrasound, especially in the context of a growth-restricted fetus and abnormal uterine artery Doppler. In a rural setting, the caregiver needs to decide whether the patient should be delivered immediately, or whether transfer to a tertiary center is appropriate. A telephone consultation and telemedicine may help. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>In women without risk factors for IUGR, comprehensive third trimester ultrasound examination including biophysical profile, fetal biometry, amniotic fluid volume, and umbilical artery Doppler studies is not recommended. (<strong>II-2D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Low-dose aspirin should be recommended to women with a previous history of placental insufficiency syndromes including IUGR and preeclampsia. It should be initiated between 12 and 16 weeks' gestation and continued until 36 weeks. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Low-dose aspirin should also be recommended to women with two or more current risk factors in pregnancy including, but not limited to, pre-gestational hypertension, obesity, maternal age &gt;40 years, history of use of artificial reproductive technology, pre-gestational diabetes mellitus (type I or II), multiple gestation, previous history of placental abruption, and previous history of placental infarction. It should be initiated between 12 and 16 weeks' gestation and continued until 36 weeks. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Umbilical artery Doppler studies are not recommended as a routine screening test in uncomplicated pregnancies. (<strong>I-E</strong>) </li>
    <li>An ultrasound examination for estimated fetal weight and amniotic fluid volume should be considered after 26 weeks if the symphysis-fundal height measurement in centimeters deviates by 3 or more from the gestational age in weeks or there is a plateau in symphysis-fundal height. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>In cases in which the fetus measures &lt;10th percentile by estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference measurement, the underlying cause of IUGR may be established by an enhanced ultrasound examination to include a detailed review of fetal anatomy, placental morphology, and Doppler studies of the uterine and umbilical arteries. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>In cases of IUGR, determination of amniotic fluid volume should be performed to aid in the differential diagnosis of IUGR and increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of placental insufficiency. (<strong>II-2B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Umbilical artery Doppler should be performed in all fetuses with an estimated fetal weight or an abdominal circumference &lt;10th percentile. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>In pregnancies affected by IUGR, umbilical artery Doppler studies after 24 weeks may prompt intervention that reduces perinatal mortality and severe perinatal morbidity due to IUGR. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>In pregnancies in which IUGR has been identified, invasive testing to rule out aneuploidy may be offered where fetal abnormalities are suspected, soft markers are seen, or no supportive evidence of underlying placental insufficiency is evident. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>In patients presenting with IUGR, maternal screening for infectious etiology may be considered. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>When IUGR is diagnosed, surveillance should be initiated. Serial ultrasound estimation of fetal weight (every 2 weeks), along with umbilical artery Doppler studies should be initiated. If available, a placental assessment and other Doppler studies such as middle cerebral artery, umbilical vein, and ductus venosus can be performed. Increased frequency of surveillance may be required. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>If fetal growth starts to plateau, amniotic fluid index starts to decline, or fetal tone or gross movements are diminished or absent, then more intensive surveillance (e.g., 2 to 3 times per week) or admission to hospital and delivery planning is required. (<strong>II-2A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Abnormal umbilical cord Doppler (e.g., absent or reversed end-diastolic flow) in the presence of IUGR is an ominous finding that requires intervention and possible delivery. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Cardiotocography (non-stress testing) performed antenatally as a test of fetal well-being should not be used in isolation to monitor fetuses with IUGR. (<strong>II-2E</strong>) </li>
    <li>Maternal administration of corticosteroids is indicated if there is a significant possibility of delivery at &lt;34 weeks' gestation, as administration may positively affect umbilical Doppler studies. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>If delivery was not indicated prior to 37 weeks in a patient diagnosed with IUGR, expectant management with close fetal and maternal surveillance versus delivery should be discussed after 37 weeks. (<strong>I-A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Site of planned delivery should take into consideration facilities and expertise available at each institution including obstetricians, pediatricians or neonatologists as appropriate, anesthesiologists, and access to Caesarean section. (<strong>III-A</strong>) </li>
