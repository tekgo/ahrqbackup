Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendations (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The following questions address the role of technical aspects (adjuvants) of operative treatment of patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). These recommendations apply to initial operative treatment of adult patients with NFPAs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Do transsphenoidal or endoscopic surgical approaches lead to symptomatic relief for NFPA patients?</p>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Transsphenoidal microsurgery or endoscopic resection is recommended for symptomatic relief of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma patients.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question</strong></span></p>
<p>What surgical approach is recommended for elderly NFPA patients?</p>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>The transsphenoidal approach is recommended for NFPA resection in American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade 1-3 elderly patients.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Does bony exposure alter the extent of NFPA resection?</p>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Adequate bony exposure of the sphenoid and sellar regions is recommended to improve extent of NFPA resection.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Does endoscopic visualization improve visualization of NFPA tumors remaining after standard microsurgery?</p>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Endoscopic approaches are recommended for better visualization of portions of tumors remaining after standard microsurgery, shown in multiple Class III studies in which direct endoscopic visualization revealed residual tumor tissue after initial microsurgery.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Is a surgical strategy of combined transsphenoidal and transcranial approaches useful in NFPA surgery?</p>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>For select, invasive NFPAs with significant suprasellar, frontal, and/or temporal extension, the combined surgical strategy of transsphenoidal and transcranial approaches is recommended.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Does use of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology improve gross total resection of NFPAs?</p>
<p><strong>Level III Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>Although intraoperative MRI (low-field or high-field) helps improve immediate overall gross total resection of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, intraoperative MRI for estimating residual tumor is not recommended due to a reported variable false-positive rate. This false-positive rate may contribute to the higher rate of gross total resection occurring with intraoperative MRI (but at the cost of removing normal tissue) and underscores the importance of incorporating surgical experience in the interpretation of intraoperative MR imaging for surgical decision-making.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Is stereotactic neuronavigation a useful adjunct for NFPA surgery?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of neuronavigation as a useful adjunct for NFPA transsphenoidal surgery.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Does introduction of intrathecal saline or air improve resection of suprasellar NFPAs?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of intrathecal saline or air introduction for suprasellar tumor delivery to augment NFPA resection.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Does perioperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion decrease the risk of postoperative CSF leak for NFPA surgeries?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of perioperative CSF diversion to prevent postoperative CSF leak.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there a superior dural closure technique to prevent CSF leaks?</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of specific dural closure techniques to prevent postoperative CSF leak for NFPA resection.</p>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The guideline task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published from January 1, 1966, to October 1, 2014. Searches were conducted in two electronic databases, PubMed and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the guideline task force members and medical/research librarians using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies. The root search strategies are provided in Appendix A of the introduction and methodology companion and the chapter-specific search strategies are provided in the appendix of the full version of the guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The searches of electronic databases were supplemented with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations were also screened. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed below. The guideline task force also examines lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions.</p>
<p><strong>Article Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were retrieved and included only if they met specific inclusion criteria. These criteria were also applied to articles provided by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline task force members who supplemented the electronic database searches with manual searches of the bibliographies. To reduce bias, these criteria were specified <em>a priori</em> before conducting the literature searches. For the purposes of this guideline, articles had to meet the following criteria to be included as evidence to support the recommendations presented in this guideline:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having a pituitary mass </li>
    <li>Enrolled patients &ge;18 years of age </li>
    <li>Either enrolled exclusively nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) patients OR combined the results of patients with NFPAs and functioning pituitary adenomas and/or other pituitary masses with &ge;90% of the patients having NFPAs </li>
    <li>Was a full article report of a clinical study </li>
    <li>If a prospective case series, reported baseline values </li>
    <li>Appeared in a peer-reviewed publication </li>
    <li>Enrolled &ge;10 NFPA patients per arm per intervention (20 total) for each outcome </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Was published in or after 1966 </li>
    <li>Quantitatively presented results </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Article Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles of the following types were excluded as evidence to support the recommendations presented in this guideline:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In vitro studies </li>
    <li>Studies performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Studies not published in English </li>
    <li>Medical records reviews, meeting abstracts, historical articles, editorial, letters, or commentaries </li>
    <li>Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or guidelines developed by others </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Methods for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published from January, 1, 1966, to October 1, 2014. Authors searched 2 electronic databases, PubMed and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the medical librarian using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies (see Appendix A in the full guideline).</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The medical literature was searched using search terms encompassing surgical resection strategies specific to transsphenoidal and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Abstracts from the results of these searches were screened, and full-text articles from potentially significant articles were reviewed.</p>
<p>Articles found on literature review based on the above criteria include 35 Class III studies involving transsphenoidal microscopic surgery, 20 Class III studies for endoscopic surgery, and 9 Class III studies involving transcranial surgery for NFPA resection. Studies that included results from multiple or combined surgical approaches were included in several of the above categories. For this guideline, transsphenoidal surgery is a broad term that includes both microscopic and endoscopic approaches. Specifically, microscopic transsphenoidal surgery or transsphenoidal microsurgery refer to surgeries performed with microscope visualization and tumor resection via either sublabial or endonasal pathways, whereas endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery refers to using endoscope visualization and resection via various anatomical corridors (usually variations of the endonasal and endosinus corridors); the transcranial approach consists of supratentorial craniotomy microscopic tumor resections.</p></div>

<p>The quality and classification of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field) was rated using an evidence hierarchy developed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Guidelines Committee for each of four different study types: therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic, and economic or decision modeling. The methodology used to conduct quality evaluations of the evidence can be located on the <a href="https://www.cns.org/guidelines/guideline-procedures-policies/guideline-development-methodology" title="CNS Web site">CNS Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The level/strength of recommendation (i.e., Level I, II, or III) was linked to the quality of the overall body of evidence included in the chapter and in support of a given recommendation.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Process Overview</span></strong></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary task force comprised of physician volunteers and evidence-based medicine trained methodologists conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the management of non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). The physician volunteers represented neurosurgeons, neuro-ophthalmologists, neuroradiologists, and endocrinologists with expertise in pituitary adenomas. The evidence-based medicine trained methodologists had previous experience in guidelines production for the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). During the development process, the task force participated in a series of conference calls and meetings. Multiple iterations of written review were conducted by the individuals of the panel and various CNS/AANS Committees prior to approval.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Task Force Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline task force panel included context experts from multiple disciplines and various areas of therapy to address the topics addressed in this guideline. Sub-task force members were assigned to a specific chapter and were involved in the literature review, the creation and editing of the evidence tables, reviewing and voting of the final recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Voting on the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force used a structured voting technique to finalize and approve the final recommendations, language, and strength of recommendations, presented in this review. The voting technique is referred to as the nominal group technique. This technique includes up to three rounds of voting, using secret ballots to ensure task force members are blinded to the responses of other task force members. All the recommendations in this review were approved following the first round of voting and no further discussion was needed to finalize the recommendations. During the course of editing and finalization of the document, changes were made to allow recommendations to conform to the rules of evidence and language as described above. When this occurred, the changes were reviewed and approved by the group.</p></div>

<p>The guideline draft was circulated to the entire task force for final review and approval prior to submission for peer review by the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). Due to the reviewers' knowledge of evidence-based medicine and clinical practice guidelines methodology training, the JGC peer reviewers served as the journal's editorial reviewers. As a part of the JGC review process, the reviewers provided input on the content of the guideline and suggested revisions prior to approval and endorsement of the draft guideline by the CNS and AANS prior to publication. The development of this guideline was editorially independent from the funding agencies (CNS Executive Committee, and AANS/CNS Joint Tumor Section Executive Committee), the CNS and Joint Tumor Section.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In one study, complications of transsphenoidal microsurgery included 24% postoperative hypopituitarism and 1 death due to hemorrhage. Another study reported 3% surgically related mortality, 1% cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and 2% need for permanent CSF shunting. A third study reported postoperative complications of diabetes insipidus (14%), CSF leak (5%) and 13% required subsequent trans-cranial craniotomy to completely remove tumor. </li>
    <li>Tumor size and cavernous sinus invasion are factors that adversely impact the rate of gross total resection of NFPAs for all surgical approaches. </li>
    <li>In elderly patients (greater than 64 years old) perioperative complications were higher in the transcranial group (5 of 6 patients) compared to the transsphenoidal group (6 of 32 patients). </li>
    <li>A study with combined transsphenoidal and transcranial resections reported complications of transient oculomotor palsy, mild hemiparesis, and postoperative seizures. </li>
