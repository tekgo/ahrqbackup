Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: The following guidance was current as of May 2013. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/fhp/practiceguides/pharyngitis.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a>for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text for detailed information on each of the screening procedures.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Points</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>General Principles</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Viral pathogens cause most cases of pharyngitis: around 90% in adults and 70% in children <em>[C]</em>. </li>
    <li>The primary reason to identify and treat group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is to decrease the risk of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) <em>[IB]</em>. The endemic incidence of ARF is around 0.23-1.88/100,000. </li>
    <li>Early treatment of GAS can decrease the time a patient is symptomatic by 1-2 days from a typical 3-7 days <em>[IB]</em> and can decrease the period of contagiousness <em>[IB]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Signs/symptoms of severe sore throat, fever, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, red pharynx with tonsillar swelling +/- exudate, and no cough indicate a higher probability of GAS pharyngitis for both adults and children. Algorithms of epidemiologic and clinical factors improve diagnosis by identifying patients with an exceedingly low risk of GAS infection <em>[C]</em>. </li>
    <li>Laboratory confirmation:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Neither culture nor rapid antigen screen differentiate individuals with GAS pharyngitis from GAS carriers with an intercurrent viral pharyngitis. </li>
        <li>Consider clinical and epidemiological findings (see Table 2 in the original guideline document) when deciding to perform a microbiological test <em>[IB]</em>. </li>
        <li>Patients with manifestations highly suggestive of a viral infection such as coryza, scleral conjunctival inflammation, hoarseness, cough, discrete ulcerative lesions, or diarrhea, are unlikely to have GAS infection and generally should NOT be tested for GAS infection <em>[IIB]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Throat culture is the presumed "gold standard" for diagnosis. Rapid streptococcal antigen tests identify GAS more rapidly, but have variable sensitivity <em>[B]</em>.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Reserve rapid strep tests for patients with a reasonable probability of having GAS. </li>
        <li>Confirm negative screen results by culture in patients &lt;16 years old (and consider in parents/siblings of school age children) due to their higher risk of acute rheumatic fever <em>[IIC]</em>. </li>
        <li>If screening for GAS in very low risk patients is desired, culture alone is cost-effective <em>[IIC]</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Penicillin V is the drug of choice in patients who can swallow pills. </li>
    <li>If using suspension, amoxicillin is better tolerated than penicillin V due to the salty/bitter taste. </li>
    <li>Amoxicillin as a single daily dose (1 gram/day) for 10 days is as effective as penicillin V or amoxicillin given multiple times per day for 10 days. </li>
    <li>A single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine avoids the problem of adherence, but is painful. </li>
    <li>If allergic to penicillin, a 10-day course of a first generation cephalosporin is indicated if no history of a type I hypersensitivity to penicillin. Oral clindamycin is an acceptable alternative, if one is unable to use a first generation cephalosporin. </li>
    <li>A macrolide is also acceptable for patients allergic to penicillins (resistant rates range 5-8%). </li>
    <li>Children with a recurrence of GAS pharyngitis shortly after completing a course of an oral antimicrobial agent can be retreated with the same agent, given an alternative oral drug, or given an intramuscular injection of penicillin G benzathine (expert opinions differ). </li>
    <li>Antibiotics must be started within 9 days after onset of acute illness and continued for 10 days (5 days for azithromycin) to eradicate GAS from the upper respiratory tract and prevent ARF <em>[D]</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controversial Areas</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Diagnosis over the telephone based on symptoms alone without lab testing is unreliable <em>[IIID]</em>. </li>
    <li>Based on a phone description, a nurse triage algorithm may guide screening for GAS <em>[IID]</em>. </li>
    <li>When an appropriately symptomatic patient is &ge;3 years old and has a family member recently diagnosed with laboratory confirmed GAS pharyngitis, one may treat without screening <em>[IID]</em>. </li>
</ul>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The literature search for this update began with the results of the literature search performed for the 2006 version of this guideline performed in June 2005. A search for literature published since that time was performed. The search on Medline was conducted prospectively for literature published from 6/1/05 to 3/30/11. One set of searches used the major keywords of: GAS pharyngitis (streptococcal infections, streptococcus pyogenes, pharyngitis, pharynx), strep throat; human; English; guidelines, controlled trials, cohort studies. Within these major keywords, specific searches were performed for the following topics: history; physical exam, signs, symptoms throat culture (strep culture); rapid strep screen; observation; antibiotics, other treatment/management, rheumatic fever or group A strep reactive arthritis; and other references found under the major search terms. Specific search terms and strategy are available upon request. Another set of searches used the major keywords of viral pharyngitis/viral sore throat with specific searches performed for: alternative and complimentary therapies (e.g., zinc, vitamin C, echinacea); other treatment.</p>
<p>The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The most important goal in treating group A streptococcal (GAS) infection is to decrease the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). </li>
    <li>Appropriate management of individuals with pharyngitis, including those at high risk for complications of GAS (e.g., ARF) </li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The value of early diagnosis in the minority of cases when group A streptococcal (GAS) infection is present and identified by antigen testing must be weighed against the higher total laboratory charges for the majority of non-GAS pharyngitis cases which require a confirmatory throat culture in patients less than 16 years old. </li>
    <li>Antibiotic side effects may include rash, nausea, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea. A single intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin produces a significant amount of pain at the injection site that may last a number of days, as well as increased risk of anaphylaxis. </li>
    <li>Azithromycin could cause potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm in some patients. At-risk patients include those with a slower-than-normal heartbeat, with potassium or magnesium deficiencies, and those using medications to treat existing heart arrhythmia. </li>
