<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Search Strategy</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The guideline task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published from January 1, 1966, to October 1, 2014. Searches were conducted in two electronic databases, PubMed and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the guideline task force members and medical/research librarians using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies. The root search strategies are provided in Appendix A of the introduction and methodology companion and the chapter-specific search strategies are provided in the appendix of the full version of the guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>The searches of electronic databases were supplemented with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications. The bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations were also screened. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed below. The guideline task force also examines lists of included and excluded studies for errors and omissions.</p>
<p><strong>Article Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles were retrieved and included only if they met specific inclusion criteria. These criteria were also applied to articles provided by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline task force members who supplemented the electronic database searches with manual searches of the bibliographies. To reduce bias, these criteria were specified <em>a priori</em> before conducting the literature searches. For the purposes of this guideline, articles had to meet the following criteria to be included as evidence to support the recommendations presented in this guideline:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Investigated patients suspected of having a pituitary mass </li>
    <li>Enrolled patients &ge;18 years of age </li>
    <li>Either enrolled exclusively nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) patients OR combined the results of patients with NFPAs and functioning pituitary adenomas and/or other pituitary masses with &ge;90% of the patients having NFPAs </li>
    <li>Was a full article report of a clinical study </li>
    <li>If a prospective case series, reported baseline values </li>
    <li>Appeared in a peer-reviewed publication </li>
    <li>Enrolled &ge;10 NFPA patients per arm per intervention (20 total) for each outcome </li>
    <li>Was of humans </li>
    <li>Was published in or after 1966 </li>
    <li>Quantitatively presented results </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Article Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Articles of the following types were excluded as evidence to support the recommendations presented in this guideline:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>In vitro studies </li>
    <li>Studies performed on cadavers </li>
    <li>Studies not published in English </li>
    <li>Medical records reviews, meeting abstracts, historical articles, editorial, letters, or commentaries </li>
    <li>Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or guidelines developed by others </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Specific Methods for This Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature Search</strong></p>
<p>The task force collaborated with a medical librarian to search for articles published from January 1, 1966, to October 1, 2014. Authors searched 2 electronic databases, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by the evidence-based clinical practice guideline taskforce members and the medical librarian using previously published search strategies to identify relevant studies (see Appendix A in the full guideline).</p></div>

Number of Source Documents
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria for analysis, of which all were Class III observational studies. No Class I evidence comparing any treatment modality was available. A considerable amount of Class III evidence (14 studies) was identified supporting primary surgical intervention in symptomatic patients with symptomatic NFPA macroadenomas. Limited Class III evidence was identified for NFPA patients treated with observation (2 studies), primary radiation-based treatment (3 studies), or medical treatment (8 studies). One prospective/retrospective study compared NFPA patients treated surgically with those treated with dopamine agonist therapy.</p>

<p>The quality and classification of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field) was rated using an evidence hierarchy developed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Guidelines Committee for each of four different study types: therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic, and economic or decision modeling. The methodology used to conduct quality evaluations of the evidence can be located on the <a href="https://www.cns.org/guidelines/guideline-procedures-policies/guideline-development-methodology" title="CNS Web site">CNS Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The level/strength of recommendation (i.e., Level I, II, or III) was linked to the quality of the overall body of evidence included in the chapter and in support of a given recommendation.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Process Overview</strong></span></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary task force comprised of physician volunteers and evidence-based medicine trained methodologists conducted a systematic review of the literature relevant to the management of non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). The physician volunteers represented neurosurgeons, neuro-ophthalmologists, neuroradiologists, and endocrinologists with expertise in pituitary adenomas. The evidence-based medicine trained methodologists had previous experience in guidelines production for the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). During the development process, the task force participated in a series of conference calls and meetings. Multiple iterations of written review were conducted by the individuals of the panel and various CNS/AANS Committees prior to approval.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Task Force Panel Consensus</span></strong></p>
<p>The guideline task force panel included context experts from multiple disciplines and various areas of therapy to address the topics addressed in this guideline. Sub-task force members were assigned to a specific chapter and were involved in the literature review, the creation and editing of the evidence tables, reviewing and voting of the final recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Voting on the Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>The task force used a structured voting technique to finalize and approve the final recommendations, language, and strength of recommendations, presented in this review. The voting technique is referred to as the nominal group technique. This technique includes up to three rounds of voting, using secret ballots to ensure task force members are blinded to the responses of other task force members. All the recommendations in this review were approved following the first round of voting and no further discussion was needed to finalize the recommendations. During the course of editing and finalization of the document, changes were made to allow recommendations to conform to the rules of evidence and language as described above. When this occurred, the changes were reviewed and approved by the group.</p></div>

<p>The guideline draft was circulated to the entire task force for final review and approval prior to submission for peer review by the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). Due to the reviewers' knowledge of evidence-based medicine and clinical practice guidelines methodology training, the JGC peer reviewers served as the journal's editorial reviewers. As a part of the JGC review process, the reviewers provided input on the content of the guideline and suggested revisions prior to approval and endorsement of the draft guideline by the CNS and AANS prior to publication. The development of this guideline was editorially independent from the funding agencies (CNS Executive Committee, and AANS/CNS Joint Tumor Section Executive Committee), the CNS and Joint Tumor Section.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclaimer of Liability</span></strong></p>
<p>This clinical systematic review and evidence-based guideline was developed by a physician volunteer task force as an educational tool that reflects the current state of knowledge at the time of completion. The presentations are designed to provide an accurate review of the subject matter covered. This guideline is disseminated with the understanding that the recommendations by the authors and consultants who have collaborated in its development are not meant to replace the individualized care and treatment advice from a patient's physician(s). If medical advice or assistance is required, the services of a physician should be sought. The recommendations contained in this guideline may not be suitable for use in all circumstances. The choice to implement any particular recommendation contained in this guideline must be made by a managing physician in light of the situation in each particular patient and on the basis of existing resources.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations</span></strong></p>
<p>The current study is limited by its systematic review methodology, which is inherently susceptible to various sources of bias, including publication, selection, and information bias. Similarly, the recommendations made are based on Class III evidence, without any prospective, randomized, controlled trial data available to truly compare efficacy of the treatment modalities in question. Nevertheless, the results of this review highlight the existing evidence available, showing a dearth of observational data supporting the primary role of surgical resection in the treatment of symptomatic nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). Future research may be directed toward primary treatment of NFPAs in patients who are unable to undergo surgical intervention based on medical comorbidities, a subset of patients in which the current literature is limited.</p></div>
