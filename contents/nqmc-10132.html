Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percent of ischemic stroke patients 18 years of age and older with who were on a lipid-lowering medication prior to hospital arrival, who are prescribed a statin medication at hospital discharge.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>There is an extensive and consistent body of evidence supporting the use of statins for secondary prevention in patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which includes individuals with ischemic stroke due to large artery atherosclerosis, individuals with ischemic stroke due to intrinsic small vessel disease, and individuals with ischemic stroke not directly due to atherosclerosis but with clinically evident atherosclerotic disease in an uninvolved cerebral or noncerebral bed. Both women and men with clinical ASCVD are at increased risk for recurrent ASCVD and ASCVD death. High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men less than or equal to 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated. In patients with clinical ASCVD and a contraindication to high-intensity statin therapy, moderate-intensity therapy should be considered as an alternative if it can be tolerated. In individuals greater than 75 years of age, the potential for ASCVD risk reduction benefits, adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences should be considered, and statin therapy individualized based on these considerations (Stone et al., 2014).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Stroke ranks as the number five cause of death in the United States, following diseases of the heart, cancer, and chronic lung-related diseases. Each year, approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke. Approximately 610,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent strokes. These numbers equate to one stroke victim every 40 seconds on average. According to 2010 mortality data, one of every 20 deaths in the United States is attributable to stroke. Women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke than men. Lifetime risk of stroke among those 55 to75 years of age was 1 in 5 for women (20% to 21%) and approximately 1 in 6 for men (14% to 17%). Blacks have a risk of first-ever stroke that is almost twice that of whites (American Heart Association [AHA], 2015). </li>
    <li>Stroke is also a leading cause of long-term disability (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009). Data from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) revealed that 50% of ischemic stroke survivors age greater than 65 years had some hemiparesis; 35% experienced depressive symptoms; 30% were unable to ambulate without assistance; 26% were dependent in activities of daily living; 19% had aphasia; and 26% were institutionalized in a nursing home. The mean lifetime cost of ischemic stroke, including inpatient care, rehabilitation, and follow-up as necessary for residual deficits are estimated at $140,048 per person (AHA, 2015). </li>
    <li>According to the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III/ATP III) (NCEP, 2002), statins should be considered as first-line drugs when low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs are indicated to achieve LDL treatment goals. Hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are powerful LDL-lowering drugs. Statin therapy reduces the risk of acute coronary syndromes, coronary procedures, and other coronary outcomes in both primary and secondary prevention. It also reduces the risk of stroke in secondary prevention. </li>
    <li>The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction of Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial (Amarenco et al., 2006) concluded that in patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and without known coronary heart disease, 80 mg of atorvastatin per day reduced the overall incidence of strokes and cardiovascular events, despite a small incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. The trial randomly assigned 4731 patients who had had a stroke or TIA within one to six months before study entry, had LDL cholesterol levels of 100 to 190 mg per deciliter (2.6 to 4.9 mmol per liter), and had no known coronary heart disease to double-blind treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day or placebo. The primary end point was a first nonfatal or fatal stroke. The mean LDL cholesterol level during the trial was 73 mg per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter) among patients receiving atorvastatin and 129 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter) among patients receiving placebo. During a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 265 patients (11.2 percent) receiving atorvastatin and 311 patients (13.1 percent) receiving placebo had a fatal or nonfatal stroke (5-year absolute reduction in risk, 2.2 percent; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 0.99; P=0.03; unadjusted P=0.05). The atorvastatin group had 218 ischemic strokes and 55 hemorrhagic strokes. The five-year absolute reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events was 3.5 percent (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.92; P=0.002). The overall mortality rate was similar, with 216 deaths in the atorvastatin group and 211 deaths in the placebo group (P=0.98), as were the rates of serious adverse events. Elevated liver enzyme values were more common in patients taking atorvastatin. </li>
