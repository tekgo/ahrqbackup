Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of patient-months of pediatric (less than 18 years) in-center hemodialysis, home hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis patients who have monthly measures for hemoglobin during the reporting period.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Prior studies show a high prevalence of anemia in the pediatric end stage renal disease (ESRD) population. Studies suggest that among chronic kidney disease (CKD) pediatric patients, anemia is associated with adverse outcomes including increased mortality risk and hospitalizations. Therefore, routine measurement of hemoglobin levels and early management of anemia if present, are critical in this population.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility level monthly and annual performance scores. Fifty-nine facilities that had at least 11 eligible patients were included in the testing. There were a total of 1,280 patients. The developer assessed reliability by calculating facility-level Pearson correlation coefficients between the current performance month and the preceding month for reporting months during January 2013&ndash;December 2013.</p>
<p>In addition, the developer calculated inter-unit reliability (IUR) for each reporting month and the overall 12 months. The monthly based measure was a simple average across individuals in the facility. The NQF-recommended approach for determining measure reliability is a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The IUR measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The yearly based measure, however, is not a simple average and the developer instead estimates the IUR using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. The developer notes that the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. Since this measure is not normally distributed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Reliability Testing</em></p>
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficients of each pair of the current and the preceding months ranged from 0.78 to 0.98. All were statistically significant (p less than 0.0001), indicating this measure is reliable over time.</p>
<p>For reliability, the developer calculated the monthly and annual IUR across the 12 reporting months. As explained above, the method for calculating the IUR was developed for measures that are approximately normally distributed across facilities. IUR=0.96, which is high and suggests 96% of variation in the measure is attributed to between facility variation.</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficients were moderate to strong, indicating this measure is reliable over time periods of measurement.</p>
<p>The IUR suggest this measure is reliable. However, since the distribution of performance scores is skewed, the IUR value should be interpreted with some caution.</p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong></p>
<p><em>Method of Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>The developer used January 2013&ndash;December 2013 CROWNWeb data to calculate facility level monthly and annual performance scores. Fifty-nine facilities that had at least 11 eligible patients and included 1,280 patients in total were included in the testing.</p>
<p>The developer computed the Spearman correlation to assess the association between the annual performance scores and the NQF-endorsed (0369) standardized mortality ratio (SMR) using the 2013 SMR. The data source and the methodology in SMR calculations are attached.</p>
<p>This measure is being maintained on the basis of face validity. The measurement of hemoglobin as a dialysis quality measure was initially developed and approved by a clinical technical expert panel (TEP), which agreed that this quality measure is important in the assessment of the quality of care for pediatric dialysis patients.</p>
<p><em>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</em></p>
<p>Spearman correlation coefficient was -0.20, p=0.13.</p>
<p><em>Interpretation</em></p>
<p>The result suggests that facilities with a higher percentage of pediatric patients (calculated as patient-months) with hemoglobin measured is associated with a lower risk of mortality relative to facilities with a lower percentage of pediatric patients with hemoglobin measured. The result is however not statistically significant. This may be due to the small sample size (e.g., small number of facilities eligible for this measure).</p></div>
