<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a common arrhythmia and an important risk factor for stroke. It is one of several conditions and lifestyle factors that have been identified as risk factors for stroke. It has been estimated that over 2 million adults in the United States have NVAF. While the median age of patients with atrial fibrillation is 75 years, the incidence increases with advancing age. For example, the Framingham Heart Study noted a dramatic increase in stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation with advancing age, from 1.5% for those 50 to 59 years of age to 23.5% for those 80 to 89 years of age. Furthermore, a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are among a limited number of predictors of high stroke risk within the population of patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, much emphasis has been placed on identifying methods for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke as well as preventing first stroke. Prevention strategies focus on the modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, and atrial fibrillation. Analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy of warfarin in the primary prevention of thromboembolic stroke, found the relative risk of thromboembolic stroke was reduced by 68% for atrial fibrillation patients treated with warfarin. In recent years, novel oral anticoagulant agents (NOACs) have been developed and proved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention, and may be considered as an alternative to warfarin for select patients. The administration of anticoagulant therapy, unless there are contraindications, is an established effective strategy in preventing recurrent stroke in high stroke risk-atrial fibrillation patients with TIA or prior stroke.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Stroke ranks as the number five cause of death in the United States, following diseases of the heart, cancer, and chronic lung-related diseases. Each year, approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke. Approximately 610,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent strokes. These numbers equate to one stroke victim every 40 seconds on average. According to 2010 mortality data, one of every 20 deaths in the United States is attributable to stroke. Women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke than men. Lifetime risk of stroke among those 55 to 75 years of age was 1 in 5 for women (20% to 21%) and approximately 1 in 6 for men (14% to 17%). Blacks have a risk of first-ever stroke that is almost twice that of whites (American Heart Association [AHA], 2015). </li>
    <li>Stroke is also a leading cause of long-term disability (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009). Data from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) revealed that 50% of ischemic stroke survivors age greater than 65 years had some hemiparesis; 35% experienced depressive symptoms; 30% were unable to ambulate without assistance; 26% were dependent in activities of daily living; 19% had aphasia; and 26% were institutionalized in a nursing home. The mean lifetime cost of ischemic stroke, including inpatient care, rehabilitation, and follow-up as necessary for residual deficits are estimated at $140,048 per person (AHA, 2015). </li>
    <li>Approximately 20% of ischemic strokes result from a cerebral embolism secondary to a cardiac arrhythmia or disorder. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disturbance (CDC, 2009). Paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent atrial fibrillation are strong predictors of first and recurrent stroke, increasing ischemic stroke risk four to five-fold. It is estimated that over 2.3 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, and the incidence becomes more prevalent with age. AF accounts for&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;1.5% of stroke in individuals 50 to 59 years of age, and &asymp; 3.5% in those 80 to 89 years of age (AHA, 2015). </li>
    <li>Patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke who have a high-risk source of cardiogenic embolism should generally be treated with anticoagulant drugs to prevent reoccurrence. Ischemic stroke rates per 1000 patient-years declined in AF patients taking anticoagulants, from 46.7% in 1992 to 19.1% in 2002 (AHA, 2015). According to the Framingham Study (Lin et al., 1996), AF is also an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke severity, recurrence, and mortality (Lin et al., 1996). In a study from Penado and associates (2003), people who had AF and were not treated with anticoagulants had a 2.1-fold increase in risk for recurrent stroke and a 2.4-fold increase in risk for recurrent severe stroke. </li>
    <li>In addition to the costs attributed to stroke, the treatment of atrial fibrillation alone represents a significant health care burden. The estimated cost of treatment of atrial fibrillation in 2005 was $6.65 billion per year, including the costs of hospitalization, inpatient and outpatient physician care, and medications (AHA, 2015). </li>
</ul>
