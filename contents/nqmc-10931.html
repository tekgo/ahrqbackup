Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 50 to 75 years of age who had appropriate screening for colorectal cancer.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Administrative and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Administrative specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid specification. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2002). It places significant economic burden on society; treatment costs over $6.5 billion per year. Unlike other screening tests that only detect disease, some methods of CRC screening can detect premalignant polyps and guide their removal, which, in theory, can prevent the cancer from developing.</p>
<p>Compelling evidence gathered during the past decade shows that systematic screening can reduce mortality from CRC. Colorectal screening may also lower mortality by allowing detection of cancer at earlier stages, when treatment is more effective (Kavanagh et al., 1998).</p>
<p>This measure is based on several organizations' clinical guidelines&mdash;USPSTF (2002), American Cancer Society (ACS) (Winawer et al., 1997), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)/American Gastroenterological Association (Smith et al., 2002).</p></div>
