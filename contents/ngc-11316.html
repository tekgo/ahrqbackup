Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the rating of evidence (<strong>High, Intermediate, Low, Insufficient</strong>); types of recommendations (<strong>Evidence based, Formal consensus, Informal consensus, No recommendation</strong>); and strength of recommendations (<strong>Strong, Moderate, Weak</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the best intervals between dosing of zoledronic acid? </strong></p>
<p><em>Updated Recommendation</em>. As recommended in the 2011 version of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) bone-modifying agents (BMAs) guideline, patients with breast cancer who have evidence of bone metastases should be treated with BMAs. One BMA is not recommended over another. If patients are treated with zoledronic acid, 4 mg intravenously administered over no less than 15 minutes, dosing options are every 12 weeks or every 3 to 4 weeks (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Question 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the role of BMAs in control of pain secondary to bone metastases? </strong></p>
<p><em>Updated Recommendation</em>. The analgesic effects of BMAs (denosumab, pamidronate, or zoledronic acid) are modest, and BMAs should not be used alone for bone pain. The Update Committee recommends that the current standard of care for supportive care and pain management be applied. This can include analgesia, adjunct therapies, radiotherapy, surgery, systemic anticancer therapy, and referral to supportive care and pain management. Evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit is insufficient to support the use of one BMA over another. Further research is needed on this clinical question (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).</p>
<p>Refer to the "Bottom Line" page in the original guideline document for recommendations unchanged from the 2011 guideline update (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guideline Update Process</strong></span></p>
<p>The Update Committee conducted a search of the PubMed database to identify systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that addressed the role of bone-modifying agents (BMAs) in the management of metastatic breast cancer. The review of the yield from this search focused on publications that reported on 4-week and 12-week intervals between the dosing of zoledronic acid and the role of BMAs in control of pain secondary to bone metastases.</p>
<p>The PubMed search (from January 2011 to March 2017) conducted to identify publications that reported on studies of the optimal intervals between BMA dosing and studies addressing the role of BMAs in control of pain secondary to bone metastases yielded 273 records.</p>
<p>To inform the special commentary on cost considerations, the Update Committee conducted an additional targeted PubMed literature search to identify articles reporting on the results of cost-effectiveness analyses of BMAs. This search was limited to non&ndash;industry-supported studies.</p>
<p>The PubMed literature search (2003 to July 2016) performed to identify articles reporting on the results of cost-effectiveness analyses of BMAs yielded 32 records; however, none of the publications provided new evidence to inform the special commentary on cost considerations. A bibliography of the results of the cost-effectiveness literature search is provided in Data Supplement 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p>Details of the searches are provided in the Data Supplement 1 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </p></div>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) and the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG) convened an Update Committee with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, and community oncology. The panel included a member of Practice Guidelines Implementation Network, and patient/advocacy representation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. The Panel had one face-to-face meeting. The Co-Chairs and ASCO staff prepared a draft guideline for review and rating by the Expert Panel. </p>
<p>For this joint ASCO-Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) focused guideline update, CCO appointed formal representatives.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Update Process</span></strong> </p>
<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) uses a signals approach to facilitate guideline updating. This approach identifies new, potentially practice-changing data&mdash;signals&mdash;that might translate into revised practice recommendations. The approach relies on targeted literature searching and the expertise of ASCO guideline panel members to identify signals. </p>
<p>For this focused update, a set of three phase III randomized noninferiority trials addressing dosing interval of zoledronic acid provided the signal. Primarily on the basis of this signal, the ASCO Breast Cancer Advisory Group ranked updating the guideline on bone-modifying agents (BMAs) in metastatic breast cancer among its highest priorities. To that end, ASCO and CCO convened a joint Update Committee to review the evidence and to formulate updated recommendations for practice. With the approval of the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group, the Update Committee expanded the guideline scope to include a commentary on cost considerations in the use of BMAs in patients with metastatic breast cancer. </p>
<p>The entire Update Committee contributed to the development of the guideline, provided critical review, and finalized the guideline recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Development Process</span></strong> </p>
<p>The full Update Committee met once and corresponded frequently through email; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs and ASCO staff. The purpose of the Panel meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Development of Recommendations</strong></span></p>
<p>The guideline recommendations were rated, in part, using the principles of the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology.</p></div>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The search for published cost-effectiveness analyses that might inform the clinical question of the relative value of available BMAs provided no definitive evidence to inform cost considerations. The Update Committee excluded articles from consideration identified from a first-level review of the literature search (see the Data Supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) because the analyses in question lacked contemporary cost data for the agents studied, included agents that are not currently available in either the United States or Canada, and/or were industry sponsored.</p></div>

Potential Harms

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Renal adverse events and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) are adverse events related to zoledronic acid. </li>
    <li>In three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the comparisons between dosing the bone-modifying agents (BMAs) every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks showed a similar rate of skeletal complications as measured by proportion of skeletal-related events (SREs) or skeletal morbidity rates (SMRs) between the 4-week and 12-week dosing study arms. SREs are defined as fracture, radiation, or surgery to bone or spinal cord compression. One of the studies also included hypercalcemia as an SRE. SMR is defined as the number of SREs over time. </li>
    <li>In one study, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event related to zoledronic acid was a rise in serum creatinine leading to discontinuation of the study drug. </li>
