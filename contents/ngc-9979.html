<p>The University of Michigan Health System released a minor revision in May 2014 to include information from guidelines from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) that was released after the July 2013 publication of this guideline.</p></div>

Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em><strong>Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</strong></em>: The following guidance was current as of July 2013. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/fhp/practiceguides/obesity.html" title="UMHS Web site">original guideline document</a> for the most current version.</p>
<p><strong>Note from NGC</strong>: The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text for additional information on recommendations for obesity prevention and management.</p>
<p>The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Points</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>. One-third or more of American adults, adolescents, and children are obese. Obesity rates have tripled in one generation, resulting in increases in associated medical comorbidities and care costs <em>[C]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Weight classification</strong>. Body mass index (BMI) (BMI &ndash; weight compared to height, see Table 1 in the original guideline document) is the primary measure of overweight and obesity. A rising BMI helps identify patients at risk of developing obesity.</p>
<p><strong>Primary prevention</strong>. Regular assessment of lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, exercise, sleep) identifies patients at risk for excess weight gain <em>[II C]</em>. Preventive lifestyle changes are important (see Tables 2-4 in the original guideline document). The most effective approach is to modify unhealthy habits of the entire family <em>[II B]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Screening</strong>. Annual assessment of BMI should be recorded and discussed with patients <em>[I D]</em>. Identify patients crossing weight or BMI percentiles, indicating increased risk for developing obesity <em>[I B]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>General approach</strong>. Obesity is a sensitive and stigmatized topic. Address it compassionately with a focus on the health benefits of adopting a healthy diet and increasing physical activity <em>[I C]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic work-up</strong>. See Table 5 in the original guideline document. For those identified as obese:</p>
<p><em>History</em>: Weight/BMI trajectory over time, prior attempts to lose weight, medications predisposing to weight gain, psychosocial factors, family history of obesity and related conditions <em>[I D]</em>.</p>
<p><em>Physical exam</em> focusing on: Blood pressure and heart rate, and signs of related comorbidities (acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism in women for example) <em>[II B]</em>.</p>
<p><em>Psychosocial assessment</em>: Identify motivated patients and also barriers to weight management <em>[II C]</em>.</p>
<p><em>Limited lab panel</em> may be considered: Lipid panel, glucose (or glycosylated hemoglobin [HgB A1C] in adults), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <em>[II B]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p><em>Goal</em>. For children, decrease rate of weight gain or 1-2 lb/week weight loss is reasonable. For adults, 10% weight loss in 6 months is recommended <em>[I D]</em> (see Table 6 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><em>Lifestyle counseling</em>. Engage patient and family. Provide education about self-management and provide support, identifying lifestyle changes, and collaboratively set goals <em>[I A]</em>.</p>
<p><em>Physical activity</em>. Incorporate regular physical activity at least 5 times per week (see Table 3 in the original guideline document for type, level, and duration of activity). Decrease sedentary time <em>[I A]</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dietary interventions</em>. Appropriate portion sizes of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and lean meats/dairy <em>[I D]</em>. Decrease intake of high calorie foods and drinks, including alcohol <em>[I A]</em> (see Table 4 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><em>Sleep</em>. Inadequate sleep is associated with excess weight gain. Recommendations for sleep duration and how to achieve good quality sleep are in Table 7 in the original guideline document <em>[II C]</em>.</p>
<p><em>Medications</em>. Identify and modify medications that may contribute to weight gain <em>[I A]</em>. Three U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications can have modest weight loss effects in certain obese patients <em>[II A]</em> (see Table 8 in the original guideline document).</p>
<p><em>Bariatric surgery</em>. Consider for motivated obese individuals who are unsuccessful in meeting initial weight loss goals in 6 months <em>[II B]</em>.</p>
<p><em>Managing comorbid conditions</em>. Identify and manage associated comorbid conditions, e.g., coronary artery disease (CAD) <em>[I B]</em>. Consider the impact of obesity on radiologic studies, procedures, and pharmacologic doses <em>[I A]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up and monitoring</strong>. See Table 9 in the original guideline document. Base follow-up frequency on risk factors and readiness of patient and family to make lifestyle changes. Consider monthly contact by member of care team <em>[II D]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Referrals</strong>. For comorbidities, dietitian, multidisciplinary weight-loss clinic, bariatric surgery <em>[I A]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy</strong>. Excessive weight gain has maternal and fetal risks and predicts long-term weight gain <em>[C]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Patient education and resources</strong>. Website resources listed. See Table 10 in the original guideline document <em>[I D]</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical performance</strong>. Meaningful Use measures BMI, blood pressure, and diet and activity counseling.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The team began the search of literature by accepting the results of a literature search performed for fairly recent systematic reviews. The search addressed obesity in children and adults in literature through 2007.</p>
<p>To update that search a systematic search of literature on Medline was performed. The major search parameters were: topic of obesity, time frame from 1/1/08&ndash;2/14/12; type of publication was guidelines, controlled trials (including meta-analyses), and cohort studies; population was human ages 2 and above (children and adults); and language was English.</p>
<p>Within these parameters individual searches were performed for the following topics: differences by gender, race, age, low socioeconomic status (SES), urban/rural; prevention; screening; history (health risk, risk for comorbidities, medications, prior weight loss attempt); body mass index (BMI) measurement; blood pressure; physical exam, signs; laboratory testing; treatment barriers, change readiness; treatment goals; addressing barriers; education; family involvement; motivational interviewing; dietary interventions; physical activity; medications; monitoring/follow-up; special programs; bariatric surgery; other references not included in any of the preceding individual searches.</p></div>
