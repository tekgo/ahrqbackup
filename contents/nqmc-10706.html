Description

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of children, ages 2 through 17 years old, with post-traumatic headache who were evaluated in the emergency department (ED) within 24 hours after an injury, and imaging of the head (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) was obtained in the absence of documented neurologic signs or symptoms that suggest intracranial hemorrhage or basilar skull fracture.</p>
<p>A lower percentage indicates better performance, as reflected by use of imaging only when indicated.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Post-traumatic headaches in children are a common clinical presentation in the setting of concussion and mild traumatic brain injury. In the United States, it has been estimated that more than 500,000 children younger than 15 years of age were evaluated in an emergency department (ED) following mild traumatic brain injury each year from 1998 to 2000 (Bazarian et al., 2005). Over the past decade, ED visits for traumatic brain injuries have increased substantially (Coronado et al., 2015). </p>
<p>Well-established evidence shows that neuroimaging to evaluate children with post-traumatic headache in the absence of documented neurologic signs or symptoms that suggest intracranial hemorrhage or skull fracture is rarely clinically indicated and is potentially harmful (Kuppermann et al., 2009; Lateef et al., 2009; Lateef et al., 2012; Ryan et al., 2014). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (2013) Choosing Wisely initiative includes guidance to discourage the unnecessary use of computed tomography (CT) scans for the immediate evaluation of minor head injuries and encourage reliance on clinical observation and criteria established by the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) to determine whether imaging is indicated (Kuppermann et al., 2009). </p>
<p>CT use has increased in the past 20 years. In a cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, Blackwell et al. (2007) found the use of CT scans for the evaluation of children with head injury nearly doubled from 1995 to 2003 (13% to 22%); Zonfrillo et al. (2015) found evidence to suggest continued increases in CT use for ED patients with concussion from 2006 to 2011. Some research suggests that rates of imaging following head injury appear to have declined in free-standing children's hospitals (Menoch et al., 2012; Mannix et al., 2012; Parker et al., 2015) and general EDs (Marin et al., 2014). Also, CT rates for children with mild head trauma vary widely between hospitals. CT rates ranged from 19% to 69% across 25 EDs (Stanley et al., 2014). Similarly, CT rates ranged from 19% to 58% for patients with minor head injury in a retrospective analysis of 5 years of hospital administrative data from 40 free-standing children's hospitals (Mannix et al., 2012). </p>
<p>Overuse has been defined as any patient who undergoes a procedure or test for an inappropriate indication (Lawson et al., 2012). Imaging overuse for the evaluation of children with post-traumatic headaches without signs or symptoms of intracranial injury subjects children to a number of risks (Malviya et al., 2000; Mathews et al., 2013; Pearce et al., 2012; Wachtel, Dexter, &amp; Dow, 2009). Individuals who undergo CT scans in early childhood tend to be at greater risk for developing leukemia, primary brain tumors, and other malignancies later in life (Mathews et al., 2013; Pearce et al., 2012). Children are also at risk for complications from sedation or anesthesia, which are often required for longer CT imaging sequences and for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and from intravenous contrast media (Zo'o et al., 2011). Cost is also an issue (Callaghan et al., 2014) that burdens the patient, as well as payers. </p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Summary of Disparities Data from the Literature</em><br />
In a cross-sectional study of 50,835 pediatric emergency visits for head injury captured in the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 2002 to 2006, white race was associated with higher odds of neuroimaging (odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-2.1) (Mannix et al., 2010). Natale and colleagues (2012) conducted a secondary analysis of data prospectively collected for the PECARN head imaging decision rule (Kuppermann et al., 2009) to test for associations between race/ethnicity and the ordering of CT among children with blunt head injury. They found that children of black non-Hispanic or Hispanic race/ethnicity had lower odds of undergoing head CT than white non-Hispanic children. Parental anxiety and parental request were cited as reasons for ordering head CT in children of white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity. Their findings suggest that overuse of CT imaging may disproportionately affect white, non-Hispanic children. Similarly, Morrison and colleagues (2015) found that minority race was associated with less radiologic testing in the children of parents with low health literacy in a cross-sectional study of 504 caregivers accompanying their child to a pediatric ED. When associated with race/ethnicity, overuse of health care, in general, is greater among white patients (Kressin &amp; Groeneveld, 2015).</p>

<p><em>Dataset Used</em>. Data used for testing were obtained from HealthCore, Inc., an independent subsidiary of Anthem, Inc., which is the largest health benefits company/insurer in the United States.

</ul>
<p><em>Measured Entities Included in Testing and Analysis</em>. This measure was tested using data contained in the HIRD. The HIRD includes automated computerized claims data and enrollment information for members from 14 geographically diverse Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield (BCBS) health plans in the Northeast, South, West, and Central regions of the United States, with members living in all 50 states. The HIRD represents data from approximately 60 million lives with medical enrollment, over 37 million lives with combined medical and pharmacy enrollment information, and 16 million lives with outpatient laboratory data. </p>
<p><em>Patients Included in Testing and Analysis</em>. This measure belongs to the Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC) <em>Overuse of Imaging for the Evaluation of Children with Headache or Seizures</em> measures collection. As part of the initial sampling strategy for testing multiple measures in this collection, approximately 2.1 million children, ages 6 months through 17 years old, were identified in the HIRD for the study's 2012 measurement year. Of these, a cohort of children with diagnosis codes for headaches and seizures were identified (57,748). Members who did not have continuous eligibility during the 2011 and 2012 calendar years were excluded, narrowing the group to 36,985 (64.0%). </p>
<p>Specifically for this measure, administrative claims were used to identify children, ages 2 through 17 years old, who had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes that indicated a post-traumatic headache, concussion, or general symptoms of headache evaluated in the emergency department (ED; 5,912, 16.0%). From this group, 2,967 children (50.2%) were identified as having either CT or MR imaging. After applying claims-based exclusions (suspected abuse and neglect, history of a medical condition that could warrant neuroimaging, loss of consciousness, skull fracture, and intracranial hemorrhage), 2,419 children (81.5%) were eligible to sample for chart review. </p>
<p>Once the population eligible for chart review was determined using administrative claims, providers associated with visits were identified. The final sampling population for chart review consisted of 1,714 children (70.9%) who could be linked to a provider having complete contact information. In an attempt to obtain an adequate number of cases to test this measure, we set a target sample of 200 abstracted charts. Patient medical records were then requested from provider offices and health care facilities for data abstraction. Patient medical records were sent to a centralized location for data abstraction. The first 204 charts received were abstracted for measure testing; 86 children (42.2%) were female, and the average age was 12.0 (SD = 3.9). </p>
<p>Of the 204 abstracted charts, one (0.5%) was excluded based on clinical documentation of suspected child abuse or neglect and five (2.5%) were excluded due to documentation of a medical condition that could otherwise warrant neuroimaging. There were 65 charts (31.9%) with clinical documentation of trauma occurring within 24 hours of the ED visit; among those, eight were excluded, as they had concussion as a diagnosis without evidence of a headache as a symptom, leaving 57 charts (27.9%) in the eligible study population.</p>
<p><strong>Method and Steps of Validity Testing</strong><br />
<em>Validity of Data Abstraction from the Medical Record</em>. Validity of medical record data was determined through re-abstraction of patient record data by a senior abstractor, considered the gold standard for medical record review. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) was calculated comparing abstractors with the senior abstractor. IRR was determined by calculating percent agreement and Cohen's kappa statistic. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values were calculated.</p>
<p><em>Face Validity of Performance Measure Score</em>. The face validity of this measure was established by a national panel of experts and parent representatives for families of children with headache and seizures convened by Q-METRIC. The Q-METRIC panel included nationally recognized experts in the area of imaging children, representing general pediatrics, pediatric radiology, pediatric neurology, pediatric neurosurgery, pediatric emergency medicine, general emergency medicine, and family medicine. In addition, measure validity was considered by experts in state Medicaid program operations, health plan quality measurement, health informatics, and health care quality measurement. In total, the Q-METRIC imaging panel included 15 experts, providing a comprehensive perspective on imaging children and the measurement of quality metrics for states, health plans, and emergency departments (EDs). The expert panel assessed whether the performance of this measure would result in improved quality of care for children with headache and seizures in relation to neuroimaging. Specifically, the panel weighed the evidence to determine if this measure of overuse could reduce unnecessary imaging among children with post-traumatic headache. The voting process to prioritize the measure was based on the ability of the measure to distinguish good from poor quality. </p>
<p><strong>Statistical Results from Validity Testing</strong><br />
<em>Validity of Data Abstraction from the Medical Record</em>. Of the 204 abstracted medical records, 30 (15%) were reviewed for IRR; percent agreement and kappa were calculated. IRR was assessed by comparing individual abstractor agreement with a senior abstractor as the gold standard on the 16 data elements abstracted from charts for this measure (corresponding to 441 eligible items after accounting for skip patterns). Disagreement was identified for two of the 16 data elements: 1) Was there documentation of increased intracranial pressure? (Indications include: swelling of the optic disc [papilledema], double vision [diplopia]) abnormal face or eye movements, dizziness [vertigo], abnormal gait [ataxia], abnormal coordination [dysmetria], confusion); percent agreement was 96.7% (kappa 0.84). 2) Was there documentation of altered mental status including comments such as "not acting like himself" per parent report?; percent agreement was 96.7% (kappa 0.90). </p>
<p>Overall, abstractor agreement was 99.3% (kappa 0.98). The sensitivity of the abstractors to identify chart-based exclusions compared with the senior abstractor was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 94.6, 100); specificity was 99.5% (95% CI; 98.1, 99.9); positive predictive value was 97.1% (95% CI; 89.9, 99.7) and negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI; 99.0, 100.0). Refer to the related contingency table (Table 7) in the original measure documentation.</p>
<p><em>Face Validity of Performance Measure Score</em>. The Q-METRIC expert panel concluded that this measure has a high degree of face validity through a detailed review of concepts and metrics considered to be essential to the appropriate imaging of children. Concepts and draft measures were rated by this group for their relative importance. This measure was highly rated, receiving an average score of 7.0 (with 9 as the highest possible score). In addition, the expert panel concluded that this measure of overuse of neuroimaging for the evaluation of children with post-traumatic headache could reduce unnecessary imaging for this population of children, and the measure would be able to distinguish good from poor quality. </p>
