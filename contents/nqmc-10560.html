<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of Medicare women 65 to 85 years of age who report ever having received a bone density test to check for osteoporosis.</p>
<p>This measure is collected using the Medicare Health Outcome Survey (HOS). Results are calculated by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) using data collected in the combined baseline and follow-up survey samples from the same measurement year.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Osteoporosis is the most common of the bone diseases that will affect Americans (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disorders [NIAMS], n.d.). In the United States (U.S.), 10 million people are estimated to have osteoporosis; another 34 million are estimated to have low bone mass, placing them at risk for osteoporosis and related fractures (NIAMS, n.d.). The prevalence of osteoporosis is high among older women. Published economic assessments suggest that diagnosis and treatment of women at risk for osteoporosis would be more cost-effective by targeting treatment to those with the lowest bone measurement results.</p>
<p>In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated its previous recommendations on osteoporosis screening and found at least fair evidence that screening improves health outcomes. It concluded that benefits significantly outweigh any harm, and recommends that clinicians routinely screen all women aged 65 and older for osteoporosis (USPSTF, 2002).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by low bone mass, which leads to bone fragility and increased susceptibility to fractures of the hip, spine and wrist (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [NIAMS], 2012). Osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, are associated with chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, decreased quality of life and increased mortality (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF], 2011). </li>
    <li>By 2025, annual fractures are expected to rise by almost 50 percent and incur $25.3 billion in health care costs (Burge et al., 2007). </li>
    <li>Osteoporosis is more common in women than men and is more common in white persons than in any other racial group (USPSTF, 2011). The prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age: 7 percent of women 50 to 59 have osteoporosis, 10 percent of women 60 to 69, 27 percent of women 70 to 79 and 35 percent of women 80 years and older have it (Looker et al., 2012). </li>
    <li>Osteoporotic fractures are responsible for almost 2.5 million medical office visits and for more than 432,000 hospital and 180,000 nursing home admissions each year (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS] &amp; Office of the Surgeon General, 2004). </li>
    <li>Osteoporosis is a serious disease in the elderly that can impact their quality of life. With appropriate screening and treatment, the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures can be reduced. </li>
</ul>
