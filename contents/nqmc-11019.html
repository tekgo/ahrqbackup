Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients greater than 18 years old for whom an established pathologic classification/risk prognostication system (such as the International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS, IPSS-R], World Health Organization-Based Prognostic Scoring System [WPSS] or Lower-Risk Prognostic Scoring System [LR-PSS, previously MD Anderson]) was used to help plan therapeutic options.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><em>Excerpts (verbatim) from guidelines</em>:<br />
The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) emerged from deliberations of the IMRAW (International MDS Risk Assessment Workshop)&hellip; Compared with previous classification systems, the risk-based IPSS has markedly improved prognostic stratification of MDS cases&hellip; Both for survival and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolution, the IPSS showed statistically greater prognostic discriminating power than earlier classification methods (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2016).</p>
<p>Data have indicated a benefit to the addition of other clinical variables to the IPSS to improve the accuracy of prognosis&hellip; Following the initial report by Malcovati et al., there have been confirmatory studies demonstrating the usefulness of the WPSS (World Health Organization-Based Prognostic Scoring System). The initial WPSS has been refined to address the notion that the requirement for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion may be somewhat subjective. In the refined WPSS, the measure of the degree of anemia by transfusion dependency is replaced by the presence (or absence) of severe anemia, defined as hemoglobin levels less than 9 g/dL for males and less than 8 g/dL for females. This approach allows for an objective assessment of anemia, while maintaining the prognostic implications of the five risk categories defined in the original WPSS (NCCN, 2016).</p>
<p>The IPSS is an important standard for assessing prognosis of primary untreated adult patients with MDS. To refine the IPSS, MDS patient databases from international institutions were coalesced to assemble a much larger combined database (Revised-IPSS [IPSS-R], n=7012, IPSS, n=816) for analysis&hellip; This system comprehensively integrated the numerous known clinical features into a method analyzing MDS patient prognosis more precisely than the initial IPSS. As such, this IPSS-R should prove beneficial for predicting the clinical outcomes of untreated MDS patients and aiding design and analysis of clinical trials in this disease (Greenberg et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Most recently, a revised IPSS (IPSS-R) was developed that also defines five risk groups (Very Low, Low, Intermediate, High, and Very High) versus the four groups in the initial IPSS&hellip; The predictive value of the IPSS-R was validated in a number of independent studies based on registry data, including studies that evaluated outcomes for patients treated with hypomethylating agents (NCCN, 2016).</p>
<p>&hellip;[O]ther recent studies have confirmed the value of the IPSS-R in treated as well as untreated patients. Since more accurate risk stratification by the IPSS-R compared to the IPSS and WPSS have been demonstrated, the IPSS-R categorization is preferred, although other systems also have good value. It is understood that some ongoing studies are using the IPSS or WPSS. Thus, a transition period is expected before more uniform prognostic risk stratification is accepted by the field (NCCN, 2016).</p>
<p>The LR-PSS, developed by investigators at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, is a prognostic model used in the evaluation of MDS, and was designed to help identify patients with lower-risk disease (IPSS Low or INT-1) who may have poor prognosis&hellip; The LR-PSS may be useful in identifying patients with lower-risk disease who have poorer prognosis and require earlier treatment. The prognostic value of the LR-RSS has been validated in several independent studies&hellip; (NCCN, 2016).</p>
<p>Although the diagnostic criteria allow for categorization of patients with MDS, the highly variable clinical outcomes within these subgroups indicate a prognostic limitation. The morphologic features contributing to this variability include the wide range of marrow blast percentages for patients with MDS with excess blasts (MDS-EB) (5% to 19%) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMML) (1% to 19%); marrow cytogenetics; and the degree and number of morbidity-associated cytopenias. These well-perceive problems for categorizing patients with MDS have led to the development of additional risk-based stratification systems (as described above) (NCCN, 2016). </p></div>
