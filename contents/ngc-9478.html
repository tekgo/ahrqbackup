Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions for the quality of the evidence (<strong>A-C</strong>) and strength of recommendation (strong [grade <strong>1</strong>], weak [grade <strong>2</strong>]) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Specific Measures</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Parenteral Anticoagulants</strong></p>
<p><em>Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Stopping an UFH infusion and general haemostatic measures are often sufficient to stop or prevent bleeding (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Protamine sulphate (1 mg per 80&ndash;100 units UFH) will fully reverse UFH, but should be given slower than 5 mg/min to minimize the risk of adverse reactions. </li>
    <li>The maximum recommended dose of 50 mg protamine is sufficient to reverse UHF in most settings. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>LMWH administration within 8 hours of the time of requirement for correction of anticoagulation: give protamine sulphate (1 mg per 100 anti-Xa units of LMWH). If ineffective, consider further protamine sulphate 0.5 mg per 100 anti-Xa units (<strong>2C</strong>). Protamine sulphate should be given slower than 5 mg/min to minimize the risk of adverse reactions. </li>
    <li>LMWH administration greater than 8 hours from the time of requirement for correction of anticoagulation: consider smaller doses of protamine (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Consider recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) if there is continued life-threatening bleeding despite protamine sulphate and the time frame suggests there is residual effect from the LMWH contributing to bleeding. (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Danaparoid Sodium</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is no specific antidote for danaparoid. Management of bleeding should be through cessation of treatment and general haemostatic measures (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Plasmapheresis may be considered for critical bleeding. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fondaparinux</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is no specific antidote for fondaparinux. Management of bleeding should be through cessation of treatment and general haemostatic measures (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Recombinant FVIIa should be considered for critical bleeding (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bivalirudin</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is no specific antidote for bivalirudin. Management of bleeding should be through cessation of treatment and general haemostatic measures (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Exceptionally, haemodialysis, haemofiltration or plasmapheresis may be considered for critical bleeding (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Argatroban</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is no specific antidote for argatroban. Management of bleeding should be through cessation of treatment and general haemostatic measures (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oral Anticoagulants</strong></p>
<p><em>Warfarin</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>All hospitals managing patients on warfarin should stock a licensed four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Emergency anticoagulation reversal in major bleeding should be with 25&ndash;50 U/kg four-factor PCC and 5 mg intravenous vitamin K (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Recombinant factor VIIa is not recommended for emergency anticoagulation reversal (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Fresh frozen plasma produces suboptimal anticoagulation reversal and should only be used if PCC is not available (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Anticoagulation reversal for non-major bleeding should be with 1&ndash;3 mg intravenous vitamin K (<strong>1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>Patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;5.0 but who are not bleeding should have 1&ndash;2 doses of warfarin withheld and their maintenance dose should be reduced (<strong>1B</strong>). The cause of the elevated INR should be investigated (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Asymptomatic patients with an INR of &ge;8.0 should receive 1&ndash;5 mg of oral vitamin K (<strong>1B</strong>). The INR should be rechecked the following day in case an additional dose of vitamin K is required. </li>
    <li>For surgery that requires reversal of warfarin and that can be delayed 6&ndash;12 hours, the INR can be corrected by giving intravenous vitamin K. For surgery that requires reversal of warfarin and which cannot be delayed for vitamin K to have time to take effect, the INR can be corrected by giving PCC and intravenous vitamin K. PCC should not be used to enable elective or non-urgent surgery (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Other Vitamin K Antagonists</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Emergency reversal of the effect of phenprocoumon, acenocoumarol and phenindione should be with 5 mg intravenous vitamin K and 25&ndash;50 units/kg four-factor PCC. </li>
    <li>For less severe bleeding or for correction of over anticoagulation, 1&ndash;5 mg of oral vitamin K is sufficient. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Direct Oral Thrombin Inhibitors &ndash; Dabigatran</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is no specific antidote for dabigatran. Management of bleeding should be through cessation of treatment and general haemostatic measures (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In bleeding patients who have taken a dose of dabigatran in the last 2 hours, consider oral activated charcoal to prevent further absorption (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>If rapidly deployable, haemodialysis, haemofiltration and charcoal haemoperfusion offer the possibility of enhanced clearance of the active drug (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In situations with ongoing life-threatening bleeding PCC, activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC), and rFVIIa should be considered (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Direct Oral Xa Inhibitors &ndash; Rivaroxaban and Apixaban</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>There is no specific antidote for rivaroxaban. Management of bleeding should be through cessation of treatment and general haemostatic measures (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>In situations with ongoing life-threatening bleeding, PCC, APCC and rFVIIa should be considered (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-platelet Drugs</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Decisions to withhold anti-platelet drugs or to administer pro-haemostatic agents should be made after a careful multi-disciplinary assessment of the risks and benefits of intervention. (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Bleeding in patients during treatment with aspirin, P2Y<sub>12</sub> antagonists or glycoprotein (GP) IIa/IIIb inhibitors should be managed in the first instance with general haemostatic measures. If necessary, drug cessation and reversal of the effect of coprescribed anticoagulants should also be considered (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Platelet transfusion (2&ndash;3 adult doses) should be considered as an additional measure for critical bleeding or prevention of bleeding before emergency surgery (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Platelet transfusion should be considered to prevent bleeding in severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;10 x 10<sup>9</sup>/l) caused by abciximab (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fibrinolytic Drugs</strong></p>
<p>For major bleeding (e.g., intracerebral) within 48 hours of administration, the task force recommends:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Stop infusion of fibrinolytic drugs and other antithrombotic drugs (<strong>1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Administer fresh frozen plasma 12 ml/kg (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Administer intravenous tranexamic acid 1 g tds (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>If there is depletion of fibrinogen, administer cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
    <li>Further therapy should be guided by results of coagulation tests (<strong>2C</strong>). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The quality of evidence is graded as high (A), moderate (B) or low (C). To put this in context it is useful to consider the uncertainty of knowledge and whether further research could change what is known or is certain.</p>
<p><strong>(A) High</strong>: Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect. Current evidence derived from randomised clinical trials without important limitations.</p>
<p><strong>(B) Moderate</strong>: Further research may well have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Current evidence derived from randomised clinical trials with important limitations (e.g., inconsistent results, imprecision &ndash; wide confidence intervals or methodological flaws &ndash; e.g., lack of blinding, large losses to follow up, failure to adhere to intention to treat analysis), or very strong evidence from observational studies or case series (e.g., large or very large and consistent estimates of the magnitude of a treatment effect or demonstration of a dose-response gradient).</p>
<p><strong>(C) Low</strong>: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Current evidence from observational studies, case series or just opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Strength of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong (grade 1)</strong>: Strong recommendations (grade 1) are made when there is confidence that the benefits do or do not outweigh harm and burden. Grade 1 recommendations can be applied uniformly to most patients. Regard as 'recommend'.</p>
<p><strong>Weak (grade 2)</strong>: Where the magnitude of benefit or not is less certain a weaker grade 2 recommendation is made. Grade 2 recommendations require judicious application to individual patients. Regard as 'suggest'.</p></div>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Recombinant activated factor VII is often considered as a last resort when all other measures have failed and the risks and benefits are carefully documented. </li>
    <li>Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) agents may increase thrombosis risk although this has not been evaluated in large-scale meta-analyses. </li>
    <li>Protamine can cause severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, hypotension, bronchospasm and skin reactions in up to 10% of patients. Risk factors are previous exposure to protamine sulphate (including protamine-containing insulin preparations), rate of administration, vasectomy, and fish allergy. </li>
    <li>Many patients who are prescribed anti-platelet drugs are at high risk of arterial thrombosis. Therefore, the safety of anti-thrombotic drug withdrawal and pro-haemostatic interventions should be considered carefully through a multi-disciplinary risk assessment. </li>
    <li>Platelet transfusion may be considered for emergency reversal of the anti-platelet effect but may confer a risk of arterial thrombosis. </li>
