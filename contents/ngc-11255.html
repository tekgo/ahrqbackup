Major Recommendations

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of recommendation (<strong>1A&ndash;2C, consensus-based [CB]</strong>) and the approach to rating the quality of evidence are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic (&gt; 4 weeks' duration) wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any specific cough pointers (e.g., coughing with feeding, digital clubbing), the Expert Panel recommends that children receive 2 weeks of antibiotics targeted to common respiratory bacteria (<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis</em>) and local antibiotic sensitivities (<strong>Grade 1A</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any specific cough pointers (e.g., coughing with feeding, digital clubbing) and whose cough resolves within 2 weeks of treatment with antibiotics targeted to local antibiotic sensitivities, the Expert Panel recommends that the diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) be made (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with PBB with lower airway (bronchoalveolar lavage or sputum) confirmation of clinically important density of respiratory bacteria (&ge;10<sup>4</sup> cfu/ml), the Expert Panel recommends that the term "microbiologically-based-PBB" (or PBB-micro) be used to differentiate it from clinically-based-PBB (PBB without lower airway bacteria confirmation) (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any specific cough pointers (e.g., coughing with feeding, digital clubbing) when the wet cough persists after 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, the Expert Panel recommends treatment with an additional 2 weeks of the appropriate antibiotic(s) (<strong>Grade 1C</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any specific cough pointers (e.g., coughing with feeding, digital clubbing), when the wet cough persists after 4 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, the Expert Panel suggests that further investigations (e.g., flexible bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures and sensitivities with or without chest computed tomography) be undertaken (<strong>Grade 2B</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and with specific cough pointers (e.g., coughing with feeding, digital clubbing), the Expert Panel recommends that further investigations (e.g., flexible bronchoscopy and/or chest computed tomography, assessment for aspiration and/or evaluation of immunologic competency) be undertaken to assess for an underlying disease (<strong>Grade 1B</strong>). </li>
    <li>For children aged &le;14 years with chronic wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any specific cough pointers (e.g., coughing with feeding, digital clubbing), the Expert Panel suggests that randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of different durations of antibiotics be undertaken in various clinical settings (particularly in primary care) to determine its influence on the number to treat and recurrence. When doing so, the Expert Panel suggests that validated cough outcomes and a-priori definitions be used (<strong>Ungraded, Consensus Based Statement</strong>). </li>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The systematic reviews were conducted based on the protocol established by selected members of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) expert cough panel. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was used for reporting. </p>
<p>The searches for both questions were conducted by librarians from the University of Massachusetts Medical School between July 19, 2015, and July 27, 2015, using the search strategies outlined in e-Table 1 and e-Table 2 (see the systematic review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). For the CHEST cough guidelines, it was determined a priori that the age cutoff for pediatric and adult components was 14 years. However, to ensure that all relevant studies were captured, the search filter included studies in subjects up to 18 years of age. The reviewers included only studies published in English. Duplicates found between Scopus and PubMed searches were identified and removed by the librarians before sending the abstracts to the two authors who reviewed the abstracts. </p>
<p>The two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts and agreed on which full-text articles to retrieve to assess for potentially eligible studies. It was planned that disagreements that could not be resolved by consensus would have been adjudicated by a third reviewer.</p>
<p>See the Online Supplement for additional information on study selection criteria and search strategy (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

<h3>
Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), both reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias criteria by using measures in Cochrane reviews. The criteria used were: random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), and selective reporting (reporting bias). For cohort studies, data were extracted by a single author and checked by a second author. In cohort studies, the study's setting, number enrolled and completing the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and main results related to the respective key questions (KQs) are reported (Tables 1-4 in the systematic review [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). For KQ2, the reviewers also described studies that reported on the association between duration of chronic wet cough and outcomes (Table 5) and mechanistic or pathobiology studies (Table 6).</p></div>

<h3>
Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The authors used a standard method as previously used by panel members: "The methodology used by the CHEST Guideline Oversight Committee to select the Expert Cough Panel Chair and the international panel of experts, perform the synthesis of the evidence and develop the recommendations and suggestions has been published. Key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for this topic. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality, and were used to support the evidence-based graded recommendations or suggestions. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was employed to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. The total number of eligible voters for each guideline statement varied based on the number of managed individuals recused from voting on any particular statements because of their potential conflicts of interest. Transparency of process was documented." In line with the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guideline methodology (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature was undertaken to provide the evidence base for recommendations outlined here.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guideline Framework</span></strong></p>
<p>As previously described, "the American College of Chest Physicians has adopted the GRADE framework (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). This framework separates the process of rating the quality of evidence from that of determining the strength of recommendation. The quality of evidence is based on the five domains of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, reporting bias, and imprecision. The quality of evidence (i.e., the confidence in estimates) is rated as high (A), moderate (B), low, or very low (C). The strength of recommendation is determined based on the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences and availability of resources." Recommendations can be strong vs weak or Grade 1 vs. 2 or ungraded.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">State of the Available Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The systematic review identified high-quality evidence to support some recommendations but not all. Where there was insufficient evidence for diagnosis and management recommendations, the panel heavily considered patient values, preferences, ease and cost of tests, and availability of potential therapies. The panel also made several suggestions for future research.</p></div>

<p>After the Cough Executive Committee provided final approval, the NetWorks, Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC), and Board of Regents disseminated manuscripts and supporting documentation for review. The CHEST NetWorks of interested members, in the areas of Airways Disorders, Allied Health, Clinical Pulmonary Medicine, Pediatric Chest Medicine, Pulmonary Physiology Function and Rehabilitation, and Respiratory Care, reviewed the content of the manuscripts. Members from the CHEST Board of Regents and GOC reviewed both content and methods, including consistency, accuracy, and completeness. The <em>CHEST</em> journal peer review process overlapped with the later rounds of these reviews. All ideas for modification were marked as mandatory or suggested, responded to or justified, and tracked through the multiple rounds of review. The CHEST Presidential line of succession provided the final approval allowing submission to the journal.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The efficacy of antibiotic treatment for resolving chronic wet cough in children was evident from three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which the forest plot from the combined RCT data showed a clear benefit (number needed to treat for benefit by end of study was 3 [95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-4.3]). Consistent with RCT data, all other studies included in the systematic review reported benefit irrespective of the study design (e.g., prospective and retrospective studies).</p></div>

<p>After publication, the guidelines were promoted to a wide audience of physicians, other health-care providers, and the public through multiple avenues. Press releases were prepared for both the lay and medical media, with major outreach efforts to all relevant print, broadcast, and Internet media. Panelists located in various large media markets were identified as potential spokespersons for interviews. Social media promotion was facilitated over Twitter, Facebook, CHEST e-Communities, internal and external blogs, and other communication routes. Blast communications were sent to CHEST members with links to the publication and postings on CHEST's Web site.</p>
<p>In addition to publication in <em>CHEST</em>, other derivative products were prepared to help with implementation, including slide sets, algorithms, and other clinical tools. These derivative products are posted on the CHEST Web site and will be made available in CHEST Guidelines. CHEST Guidelines will be the repository for the most current recommendations and suggestions from all CHEST guidelines, consensus statements, and hybrid documents. This online repository will also house a collection of related resources. </p>
<p>Associations that appointed representatives earlier in the process were asked to consider endorsing the approved guidelines for listing in the final publication. These organizations were requested to help promote the publication to their memberships through newsletters, Web sites, and other means.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict-of-Interest Reviews</span></strong></p>
<p>For practitioners to adhere to guideline or consensus statement recommendations, they must have confidence that the convened experts represent all relevant stakeholders and do not harbor biases that might influence the discussions and resulting clinical recommendations or suggestions. This is even more important when guidance includes consensus of a panel of experts. The chair of this project was vetted and determined to be free of conflicts of interest (COIs). The Guidelines Oversight Committee (GOC) Policies and Procedures Subcommittee and the full GOC, in accordance with explicit rules regarding COI and expertise, carefully reviewed all nominees. Greater explanations of these and other evidence-based processes are published separately. The panel is predominantly free of relevant COIs. A few individuals with moderate conflicts, whose expertise was highly valued and who could not be easily replaced, were selected. These panelists were given individualized management plans and restricted from writing and voting on clinical content areas related to current conflicts and participation in future activities that could be perceived as conflicts.</p>
