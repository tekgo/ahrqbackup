Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of members 18 to 85 years of age who had a diagnosis of hypertension and whose blood pressure (BP) was adequately controlled during the measurement year based on the following criteria: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Members 18 to 59 years of age whose BP was less than 140/90 mm Hg </li>
    <li>Members 60 to 85 years of age with a diagnosis of diabetes whose BP was less than 140/90 mm Hg </li>
    <li>Members 60 to 85 years of age without a diagnosis of diabetes whose BP was less than 150/90 mm Hg </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: Use the Hybrid Method for this measure. A single rate is reported and is the sum of all three groups.</p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Approximately 67 million Americans have high blood pressure (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). Treatment to improve hypertension includes dietary and lifestyle changes, as well as appropriate use of medications. </p>
<p>The specifications for this measure are consistent with current clinical guidelines, such as those of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the Joint National Committee (James et al., 2014). </p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Known as the "silent killer," high blood pressure, or hypertension, increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, which are the leading causes of death in the United States (U.S) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). </li>
    <li>The medical costs of high blood pressure total more than $46 billion annually. This number could increase to $274 billion by 2030 (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). </li>
    <li>In 2011, there were 65,123 deaths attributable to high blood pressure. From 2001 to 2011, the death rate attributable to high blood pressure increased 13.2 percent (Mozaffarian et al., 2015). </li>
    <li>Approximately one in three U.S. adults, or about 70 million people, have high blood pressure, but only about half (52 percent) of these people have it under control (CDC, 2015). </li>
    <li>Controlling high blood pressure is an important step in preventing heart attacks, stroke and kidney disease, and in reducing the risk of developing other serious conditions (James et al., 2014). Health care providers and plans can help individuals manage their high blood pressure by prescribing medications and encouraging low-sodium diets, increased physical activity and smoking cessation. </li>
