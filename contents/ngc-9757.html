Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The rating schemes used for the strength of the evidence (<strong>Class I-III</strong>) and the levels of recommendations (<strong>Level I-III</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong></p>
<p>Management of patients with an acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar monitored setting is recommended.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Use of cardiac, hemodynamic, and respiratory monitoring devices to detect cardiovascular dysfunction and respiratory insufficiency in patients following acute SCI is recommended. </li>
    <li>Correction of hypotension in SCI (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg) when possible and as soon as possible is recommended. </li>
    <li>Maintenance of mean arterial blood pressure between 85 and 90 mmHg for the first 7 days following an acute SCI is recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary</span></strong></p>
<p>Patients with acute cervical SCI frequently develop hypotension, hypoxemia, pulmonary dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability, often despite initial stable cardiac and pulmonary function. These complications are not limited to patients with complete SCI. Life threatening cardiovascular instability and respiratory insufficiency may be transient and episodic and may be recurrent in the first 7 to 10 days after injury. Patients with the most severe neurological injuries appear to have the greatest risk of these life-threatening events. <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence indicates that ICU monitoring allows the early detection of hemodynamic instability, cardiac disturbances, pulmonary dysfunction, and hypoxemia. Prompt treatment of these events in patients with acute SCI reduces cardiac- and respiratory-related morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>Management in an ICU or other monitored setting appears to have an impact on neurological outcome after acute cervical SCI. Retrospective studies consistently report that volume expansion and blood pressure augmentation performed under controlled circumstances in an ICU setting are linked to improved American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores in patients with acute SCI compared with historical controls. <strong>Class III</strong> medical evidence suggests that the maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 85 to 90 mmHg after acute SCI for a duration of 7 days is safe and may improve spinal cord perfusion and ultimately neurological outcome.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Search Criteria</strong></p>
<p>A National Library of Medicine (PubMed) computerized literature search from 2000 to 2011 was undertaken using Medical Subject Headings in combination with "spinal cord injury": medical management, nonoperative management, hypotension, spinal cord blood flow, respiratory insufficiency, pulmonary complications, and intensive care unit. Approximately 3500 citations were acquired. Non&ndash;English-language citations were excluded. Titles and abstracts of the remaining publications were reviewed, and relevant articles were selected to develop the guidelines. The authors focused on 4 specific topics concerning human patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI): management in an intensive care unit (ICU), cardiac instability, hypotension, and respiratory/pulmonary dysfunction. Additional citations were extracted from the reference lists of the remaining papers. Finally, members of the author group were asked to contribute articles known to them on the subject matter that were not found by other search means. Articles describing economics, epidemiology, anesthesia, monitoring techniques, penetrating cord injuries, nursing care, infectious or urologic complications, chronic complications, or remote SCIs were excluded. These efforts resulted in 11 articles, which form the foundation for this updated review. All studies provided Class III medical evidence.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Medical evidence-based guidelines are not meant to be restrictive or to limit a clinician's practice. They chronicle multiple successful treatment options (for example) and stratify the more successful and the less successful strategies based on scientific merit. They are not absolute, "must be followed" rules. This process may identify the most valid and reliable imaging strategy for a given injury, for example, but because of regional or institutional resources, or patient co-morbidity, that particular imaging strategy may not be possible for a patient with that injury. Alternative acceptable imaging options may be more practical or applicable in this hypothetical circumstance. </li>
    <li>Guidelines documents are not tools to be used by external agencies to measure or control the care provided by clinicians. They are not medical-legal instruments or a "set of certainties" that must be followed in the assessment or treatment of the individual pathology in the individual patients we treat. While a powerful and comprehensive resource tool, guidelines and the recommendations contained therein do not necessarily represent "the answer" for the medical and surgical dilemmas faced with many patients. </li>
