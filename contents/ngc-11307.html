Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Levels of evidence (<strong>I&ndash;V</strong>) and grades of recommendation (<strong>A&ndash;F</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note</strong>: These recommendations and clinical practice guidelines are based on the scientific literature published prior to April 2016. Please refer to the American Physical Therapy Association's (APTA's) previously published guidelines on "Hip Pain and Mobility Deficits &ndash; Hip Osteoarthritis" for literature reviewed prior to 2009.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Diagnosis/Classification</strong></span></p>
<p>Clinicians should use the following criteria to classify adults over the age of 50 years into the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) category of coxarthrosis and the associated International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) impairment-based category of hip pain (b28016 Pain in joints) and mobility deficits (b7100 Mobility of a single joint): moderate anterior or lateral hip pain during weight-bearing activities, morning stiffness less than 1 hour in duration after wakening, hip internal rotation range of motion less than 24&deg; or internal rotation and hip flexion 15&deg; less than the nonpainful side, and/or increased hip pain associated with passive hip internal rotation. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong></span></p>
<p>Clinicians should revise the diagnosis and change their plan of care, or refer the patient to the appropriate clinician, when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this guideline, or when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the patient's impairments of body function. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: F</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Examination</strong></span> </p>
<p><strong>Outcome Measures: Activity Limitation/Self-Report Measures</strong> </p>
<p>Clinicians should use validated outcome measures that include domains of hip pain, body function impairment, activity limitation, and participation restriction to assess outcomes of treatment of hip osteoarthritis. </p>
<p>Measures to assess hip pain may include the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), pressure pain threshold (PPT), and pain visual analog scale (VAS). </p>
<p>Activity limitation and participation restriction outcome measures may include the WOMAC physical function subscale, the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), and Harris Hip Score (HHS). </p>
<p>(<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Activity Limitation/Physical Performance Measures</strong></p>
<p>To assess activity limitation, participation restrictions, and changes in the patient's level of function over the episode of care, clinicians should utilize reliable and valid physical performance measures, such as the 6-minute walk test, 30-second chair stand, stair measure, timed up-and-go test, self-paced walk, timed single-leg stance, 4-square step test, and step test. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>) </p>
<p>Clinicians should measure balance performance and activities that predict the risk of falls in adults with hip osteoarthritis, especially those with decreased physical function or a high risk of falls because of past history. Recommended balance tests for patients with osteoarthritis include the Berg Balance Scale, 4-square step test, and timed single-leg stance test. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>) </p>
<p>Clinicians should use published recommendations from the Academy of Geriatric Physical Therapy of the American Physical Therapy Association to guide fall risk management in patients with hip osteoarthritis to assess and manage fall risk. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: F</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Physical Impairment Measures</strong></p>
<p>When examining a patient with hip pain/hip osteoarthritis over an episode of care, clinicians should document the flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABER or Patrick's) test and passive hip range of motion and hip muscle strength, including internal rotation, external rotation, flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>) </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interventions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Patient Education</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should provide patient education combined with exercise and/or manual therapy. Education should include teaching activity modification, exercise, supporting weight reduction when overweight, and methods of unloading the arthritic joints. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Functional, Gait, and Balance Training</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should provide impairment-based functional, gait, and balance training, including the proper use of assistive devices (canes, crutches, walkers), to patients with hip osteoarthritis and activity limitations, balance impairment, and/or gait limitations when associated problems are observed and documented during the history or physical assessment of the patient. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>) </p>
<p>Clinicians should individualize prescription of therapeutic activities based on the patient's values, daily life participation, and functional activity needs. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Manual Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use manual therapy for patients with mild to moderate hip osteoarthritis and impairment of joint mobility, flexibility, and/or pain. Manual therapy may include thrust, nonthrust, and soft tissue mobilization. Doses and duration may range from 1 to 3 times per week over 6 to 12 weeks in patients with mild to moderate hip osteoarthritis. As hip motion improves, clinicians should add exercises including stretching and strengthening to augment and sustain gains in the patient's range of motion, flexibility, and strength. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Flexibility, Strengthening, and Endurance Exercises</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should use individualized flexibility, strengthening, and endurance exercises to address impairments in hip range of motion, specific muscle weaknesses, and limited thigh (hip) muscle flexibility. For group-based exercise programs, effort should be made to tailor exercises to address patients' most relevant physical impairments. Dosage and duration of treatment for effect should range from 1 to 5 times per week over 6 to 12 weeks in patients with mild to moderate hip osteoarthritis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: A</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Modalities</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians may use ultrasound (1 MHz; 1 W/cm<sup>2</sup> for 5 minutes each to the anterior, lateral, and posterior hip for a total of 10 treatments over a 2-week period) in addition to exercise and hot packs in the short-term management of pain and activity limitation in individuals with hip osteoarthritis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: B</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Bracing</strong></p>
<p>Clinicians should not use bracing as a first line of treatment. A brace may be used after exercise or manual therapies are unsuccessful in improving participation in activities that require turning/ pivoting for patients with mild to moderate hip osteoarthritis, especially in those with bilateral hip osteoarthritis. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: F</strong>) </p>
<p><strong>Weight Loss</strong></p>
<p>In addition to providing exercise intervention, clinicians should collaborate with physicians, nutritionists, or dietitians to support weight reduction in individuals with hip osteoarthritis who are overweight or obese. (<strong>Grade of Recommendation: C</strong>) </p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The authors of this guideline revision worked with research librarians with expertise in systematic review to perform a systematic search for hip osteoarthritis (OA) articles published since 2008 related to classification, examination, and intervention strategies, consistent with previous guideline development methods related to International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) classification. Briefly, the following databases were searched from 2008 to 2016: MEDLINE (PubMed; 2008-2016), CINAHL (EBSCO; 2008-date), PEDro (EBSCO; 2008-date), and the Cochrane Library (Wiley; 2008-date). See Appendix A in the original guideline document for full search strategies and Appendix B for search dates and results.</p>
<p>Articles contributing to recommendations were reviewed based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, with the goal of identifying evidence relevant to physical therapist clinical decision making for adults with hip OA. The title and abstract of each article were reviewed independently by 2 members of the clinical practice guideline (CPG) development team for inclusion. See Appendix C in the original guideline document for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full-text review was then similarly conducted to obtain the final set of articles for contribution to recommendations. The team leader provided the final decision for discrepancies that were not resolved by the review team. For selected relevant topics that were not appropriate for the development of recommendations, such as incidence and imaging, articles were gathered, reviewed, and synthesized but were not subject to a formal systematic review process and were not included in the flow chart. Evidence tables for this CPG are available on the Clinical Practice Guidelines page of the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) Web site (<a href="http://www.orthopt.org" title="Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) Web site ">www.orthopt.org</a>). </p></div>

<p>Individual clinical research articles were graded according to criteria adapted from the Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (Oxford, United Kingdom) for diagnostic, prospective, and therapeutic studies. In teams of 2, each reviewer independently assigned a level of evidence and evaluated the quality of each article using a critical appraisal tool. See the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Evidence" field for a levels of evidence table and Appendix G in the original guideline document for details on procedures used for assigning levels of evidence. The evidence update was organized from highest level of evidence to lowest level.</p>

<div class="content_para"><p>Content experts were appointed by the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) to conduct a review of the literature and to develop an updated hip osteoarthritis (OA) clinical practice guideline (CPG) as indicated by the current state of the evidence in the field. The aims of the revision were to provide a concise summary of the evidence since publication in 2009 of the original guidelines, and to develop new recommendations or revise previously published recommendations to support evidence-based practice. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p>The strength of the evidence supporting the recommendations was graded according to the previously established methods for the 2009 guideline and those provided in the original guideline document. Each team developed recommendations based on the strength of evidence, including how directly the studies addressed the question of hip pain and hip osteoarthritis (OA). In developing their recommendations, the authors considered the strengths and limitations of the body of evidence and the health benefits, side effects, and risks of tests and interventions.</p></div>

Cost Analysis

<div class="content_para"><p>One research group conducted an economic evaluation of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted by another group of patients who met the American College of Rheumatology&nbsp;(ACR) criteria for hip osteoarthritis (OA) using 1-year outcomes. Manual therapy, exercise therapy, and combined manual and exercise therapy provided gains in quality-adjusted life-years compared to usual medical care. From the societal perspective, manual therapy was cost saving compared to usual care, and exercise therapy was cost-effective. Using either exercise or manual therapy was more cost-effective than the combination of the 2. The 1-year time frame is an important limitation of this study because gains sustained over time would increase cost-effectiveness.</p></div>

<p>Identified reviewers who are experts in hip osteoarthritis (OA) management and rehabilitation reviewed the clinical practice guideline (CPG) draft for integrity, accuracy, and to ensure that it fully represents the current evidence for the condition. The guideline draft was also posted for public comment and review on <a href="https://www.orthopt.org" title="Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) Web site">www.orthopt.org</a>, and a notification of this posting was sent to the members of the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA). In addition, a panel of consumer/patient representatives and external stakeholders, such as claims reviewers, medical coding experts, academic educators, clinical educators, physician specialists, and researchers, also reviewed the guideline. All comments, suggestions, and feedback from the expert reviewers, the public, and consumer/patient representatives were provided to the authors and editors for consideration and revisions. Guideline-development methods, policies, and implementation processes are reviewed at least yearly by the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF)-based Clinical Practice Guideline Advisory Panel, including consumer/patient representatives, external stakeholders, and experts in physical therapy practice guideline methodology. </p></div>

<p>These guidelines are not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of medical care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made based on clinician experience and expertise in light of the clinical presentation of the patient, the available evidence, available diagnostic and treatment options, and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences. However, it is suggested that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in the patient's medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.</p></div>
