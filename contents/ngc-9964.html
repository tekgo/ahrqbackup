<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends removal of suspected neoplastic lesions at the time of colonoscopy when not contraindicated and as technical expertise allows. (++++) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the preoperative locoregional staging of colorectal cancer (CRC) to guide therapy. (+++O) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends weighing the risk of recurrence against the individual's operative risk in all cases in which surgery is being considered as a treatment for CRC. (+++O) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends surgical management of all malignant polyps with unfavorable histological features if the patient is an appropriate surgical candidate. (+++O) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends that pedunculated polyps found to contain cancer confined to the submucosa of the polyp or stalk and with favorable histological features be managed endoscopically. (+++O) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends surgery for sessile or flat colonic neoplasia that demonstrates submucosal invasion if the patient is an appropriate surgical candidate. (+++O) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee suggests surgical management for sessile or flat colonic neoplasia that is determined to be malignant after piecemeal endoscopic resection if the patient is an appropriate surgical candidate. (++OO) </li>
    <li>The Practice Committee recommends endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) only be attempted if complete resection of neoplastic lesions is anticipated. (+++O) </li>

Potential Harms

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The major adverse events associated with colonic self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) placement include obstruction, migration, and perforation. Dilation after colonic SEMS placement should be avoided because of the associated risk of perforation. </li>
    <li>In all cases of potential surgical referral, the risk of recurrent disease should be weighed against the operative risk in individual patients. </li>
    <li>The major adverse events for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal resection (ESR) are the same as those for standard polypectomy (i.e., bleeding and perforation); however, the rate is higher. </li>

Qualifying Statements

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Guidelines for appropriate use of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus at the time that the guidelines are drafted. Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of this guideline. This guideline may be revised as necessary to account for changes in technology, new data, or other aspects of clinical practice. </li>
    <li>This guideline is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. This guideline is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment. Clinical decisions in any particular case involve a complex analysis of the patient's condition and available courses of action. Therefore, clinical considerations may lead an endoscopist to take a course of action that varies from these guidelines. </li>
