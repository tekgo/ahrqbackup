</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Imaging Follow-up</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Where initial risk stratiﬁcation assigns a nodule a chance of malignancy of &lt;10%, assess growth rate using interval CT with capability for automated volumetric analysis. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Assess growth for nodules &ge;80 mm<sup>3</sup> or &ge;6 mm maximum diameter by calculating volume doubling time (VDT) by repeat CT at 3 months and 1 year. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>

    <li>Consider discharge or ongoing CT surveillance for people who have nodules with a VDT of &gt;600 days, taking into account patient preference and clinical factors such as ﬁtness and age. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Where nodules are detected in association with an extrapulmonary primary cancer, consider the growth rate in the context of the primary and any treatment thereof. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management of Sub-solid Nodules (SSNs)</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Do not follow-up SSNs that are &lt;5 mm in maximum diameter at baseline. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Reassess all SSNs with a repeat thin-section CT at 3 months. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use the Brock risk prediction tool to calculate risk of malignancy in SSNs &ge;5 mm that are unchanged at 3 months. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider using other factors to further reﬁne the estimate of risk of malignancy, including smoking status, peripheral eosinophilia, history of lung cancer, size of solid component, bubble-like appearance and pleural indentation. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Offer repeat low-dose, thin-section CT at 1, 2 and 4 years from baseline where the risk of malignancy is approximately &lt;10%. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Discuss the options of observation with repeat CT, CT-guided biopsy, or resection/non-surgical treatment with the patient where the risk of malignancy is approximately &gt;10%; consider factors such as age, comorbidities and risk of surgery. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider using changes in mass of SSNs to accurately assess growth. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider resection/non-surgical treatment or observation for pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs) that enlarge &ge;2 mm in maximum diameter; if observed, repeat CT after a maximum of 6 months. Take into account patient choice, age, comorbidities and risk of surgery. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Favour resection/non-surgical treatment over observation for part-solid nodules (PSNs) that show enlargement of the solid component, or for pGGNs that develop a solid component. Take into account patient choice, age, comorbidities and risk of surgery. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Favour resection/non-surgical treatment over observation where malignancy is pathologically proven. Take into account patient choice, age, comorbidities and risk of surgery. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Further Imaging in Management of Pulmonary Nodules</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Offer a positron emission tomography&ndash;computed tomography (PET-CT) scan to patients with a pulmonary nodule with an initial risk of malignancy of &gt;10% (Brock model) where the nodule size is greater than the local PET-CT detection threshold. (<strong>B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Ensure that PET-CT reports include the method of analysis. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use qualitative assessment with an ordinal scale to deﬁne fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) uptake as absent, faint, moderate or high using the following guide:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Absent&mdash;uptake indiscernible from background lung tissue </li>
        <li>Faint&mdash;uptake less than or equal to mediastinal blood pool </li>
        <li>Moderate&mdash;uptake greater than mediastinal blood pool </li>
        <li>Intense&mdash;uptake markedly greater than mediastinal blood pool (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reassess risk after PET-CT using the Herder prediction tool. (<strong>B</strong>) </li>
    <li>After reassessment of risk:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Consider CT surveillance for people who have nodules with a chance of malignancy of &lt;10%. </li>
        <li>Consider image-guided biopsy where the risk of malignancy is assessed to be between 10% and 70%; other options are excision biopsy or CT surveillance guided by individual risk and patient preference. </li>
        <li>Offer people surgical resection as the favoured option where the risk that the nodule is malignant is &gt;70%; consider non-surgical treatment for people who are not ﬁt for surgery. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do not use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission CT (SPECT) or dynamic contrast-enhanced CT to determine whether a nodule is malignant where PET-CT is an available alternative. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Further research is needed into the most effective follow-up pathway in low to medium risk patients and for those with pGGNs. (<strong>RR</strong>) </li>
    <li>Further research should be undertaken into the use of PET-CT in the evaluation of pGGNs using lower standardised uptake value (SUV) cut-off values. (<strong>RR</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-imaging Tests and Non-surgical Biopsy</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Do not use biomarkers in the assessment of pulmonary nodules. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider bronchoscopy in the evaluation of pulmonary nodules with bronchus sign present on CT. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider augmenting yield from bronchoscopy using either radial endobronchial ultrasound, ﬂuoroscopy or electromagnetic navigation. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Offer percutaneous lung biopsy in cases where the result will alter the management plan. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider the use of other imaging techniques such as C-arm cone beam CT and multiplanar reconstruction to improve diagnostic accuracy. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider the risk of pneumothorax when deciding on a transthoracic needle biopsy. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Interpret negative lung biopsies in the context of the pre-test probability of malignancy. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider repeating percutaneous lung biopsies where the probability of malignancy is high. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Undertake research into the application of new and existing biomarkers in the evaluation of pulmonary nodules. (<strong>RR</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surgical Excision Biopsy</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Surgical resection of pulmonary nodules should preferentially be by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) rather than by an open approach. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Offer lobectomy (to patients ﬁt enough to undergo the procedure) as deﬁnitive management of a pulmonary nodule conﬁrmed as lung cancer preoperatively or after wedge resection and intraoperative frozen section analysis during the same anesthetic procedure. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider anatomical segmentectomy where preservation of functioning lung tissue may reduce the operative risk and improve physiological outcome. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider a diagnostic anatomical segmentectomy for nodules &lt;2 cm in diameter without nodal disease when there has been no pathological conﬁrmation and frozen section analysis is not possible. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use localisation techniques depending on local availability and expertise to facilitate limited resection of pulmonary nodules. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider sublobar resection for pGGNs deemed to require surgical resection owing to the excellent long-term prognosis and low risk of local relapse. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Prospective trials should compare complications and oncological outcomes from lobectomy versus anatomical segmentectomy in appropriately selected patients. (<strong>RR</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-surgical Treatment without Pathological Conﬁrmation of Malignancy</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Consider people who are unﬁt for surgery who have pulmonary nodule(s) with high probability of malignancy, where biopsy is non-diagnostic or not possible, for treatment with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) if technically suitable. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider people who are unﬁt for surgery who have pulmonary nodule(s) with high probability of malignancy, where biopsy is non-diagnostic or not possible, for treatment with conventional radical radiotherapy if not suitable for SABR or RFA. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Do not use inhaled corticosteroids in the management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules. (<strong>B</strong>) </li>
    <li>Do not use antibiotics in the management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Consider prospective randomised trials of local treatments for pathologically proven or clinically diagnosed early-stage lung cancer and pulmonary oligometastases. (<strong>RR</strong>) </li>
    <li>Prospective randomised trials of interventions for pathologically proven or clinically diagnosed early-stage lung cancer should include assessment of harms. (<strong>RR</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information and Support</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Offer accurate and understandable information to patients and carers about the probability of malignancy of the pulmonary nodule. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Ensure patients have the opportunity to discuss concerns about lung cancer and surveillance regimens. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Offer patients the choice of seeing a lung cancer nurse specialist where the probability of malignancy is high or when patients are anxious about the possibility of having lung cancer. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Ensure that clear written and verbal information is available on follow-up schedules and the number of repeat CT scans required. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Explain the risks and beneﬁts of investigations and treatment. Where appropriate, offer a choice of management. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Inform patients who remain at high risk of developing malignancy about the warning symptoms of lung cancer at the start of observation and at discharge from follow-up. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Emphasise to patients the importance of smoking cessation and offer referral to smoking cessation services. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Aspects of the Imaging of Pulmonary Nodules</span></strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Where CT scans are performed that include the chest where nodule detection is of potential importance, use a maximum section thickness of 1.25 mm. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use low radiation dose CT with a maximum section thickness of 1.25 mm in follow-up imaging. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use maximum intensity projection (MIP) or volume rendering (VR) to improve nodule detection and characterisation. (<strong>C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Use diameter measurements where volumetry is not possible or where there is clear evidence of marked growth. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>When reporting on growth, take into account factors that may reduce accuracy such as nodule shape and position and interval between scans. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>
    <li>Ensure a radiologist or radiographer checks that the nodule has been accurately segmented. (<strong>D</strong>) </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clinical Questions and Literature Search</span></strong></p>
<p>Clinical questions were structured in the PICO (Patient, Intervention, Control, Outcome) format, to deﬁne the scope of the guideline and inform the literature search (see supplementary appendix 1 [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).</p>
<p>Systematic electronic database searches were conducted to identify potentially relevant studies for inclusion in the guideline. For each topic area the following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process), Ovid EMBASE and the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) from 1980.</p>
<p>The searches were ﬁrst run in November 2012 and updated in June 2014 (see supplementary appendix 2 for search strategy [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Searches included a combination of indexed terms and free text terms and were limited to English language publications only. The initial search identiﬁed 6819 potential abstracts and the second search 2739.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Appraisal of Literature</strong></span></p>
<p>Appraisal was performed to be compliant with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) collaboration. Two individuals read the title and abstract of each article retrieved by the literature searches and decided whether the paper was deﬁnitely relevant, possibly relevant or not relevant to the project. Criteria formulated for categorizing the abstracts into these three groups were:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Whether the study dealt with the clinical question </li>
    <li>Whether the appropriate study type was used to produce the best evidence to answer the clinical question </li>
    <li>Review articles were excluded </li>
    <li>Abstract was in English </li>
    <li>Abstracts were reviewed irrespective of the journal of publication, country in which the research was performed or published and the date of publication</li>
</ul>
<p>The full paper was obtained for all relevant or possibly relevant abstracts and allocated to the relevant section(s) of the guideline.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst screening process identiﬁed 2021 of the initial 6819 reference abstracts to be deﬁnitely or possibly relevant to the guideline.</p>
<p>The second literature search in June 2014 yielded 2739 abstracts of which 1611 were possibly or deﬁnitely relevant. Four members of the group sorted the references into subject groups and these were forwarded to the pairs of reviewers for each group.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline is based on the best available evidence. The methodology used to write the guideline adheres strictly to the criteria as set out by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) collaboration, which is available online (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org/resource-centre/agree-ii/" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org/resource-centre/agree-ii/</a>). The British Thoracic Society Standards of Care Committee guideline production manual is available at <a href="https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/guidelines-and-quality-standards/" title="BTS Web site">https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/guidelines-and-quality-standards/</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considered Judgement and Grading of Evidence</span></strong></p>
<p>The Guideline Development Group (GDG) used the evidence tables to judge the body of evidence and grade recommendations for this guideline. Evidence tables are available in supplementary appendix 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Where evidence was lacking to answer the formulated clinical questions, expert opinions were obtained through consensus. The following were considered in grading of the recommendations:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The available volume of the body of evidence </li>
    <li>How applicable the obtained evidence was in making recommendations for the deﬁned target audience of this guideline </li>
    <li>Whether the evidence was generalisable to the target population for the guideline </li>
    <li>Whether there was clear consistency in the evidence obtained to support recommendations </li>
    <li>What the implications of recommendations would be on clinical practice in terms of resources and skilled expertise </li>
    <li>Cost-effectiveness was not reviewed in detail as in-depth economic analysis of recommendations fell beyond the scope of this guideline</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations were graded from A to D according to the strength of the evidence as shown in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field. In line with Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidance, 'minus' evidence was considered in context but in the absence of other 'plus' supporting evidence, it was discussed by the GDG and any recommendation hence made was grade D. Important practical points lacking any research evidence, and not likely to be obtained by research evidence were highlighted as 'good practice points'. Recommendations for further research are designated 'RR'.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drafting the Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>The GDG corresponded regularly by email, and meetings of the full group were held in February, May and November 2012, February, April, June and October 2013, February and June 2014.</p></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Improved nodule detection and characterisation, anatomical localisation, and risk stratification </li>
    <li>In one study, the major benefit of knowing the computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy result was a reduction in unnecessary surgery, especially when the clinical perception of pre-test probability of malignancy was intermediate. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the evidence statements in the original guideline document for a discussion of benefits of specific recommendations.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Risk of false-positive and false-negative imaging and biopsy results </li>
    <li>Lesion detection on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans is adversely affected by breathing artefact, particularly peripheral lesions and those just above the diaphragm, the latter additionally affected by scatter artefact from the liver. </li>
    <li>Pneumothorax is the most common complication of CT-guided biopsies; by far the largest study showed an incidence of 15%, with 6.6% of patients requiring an intercostal drain insertion. Consistent factors that increase the risk are lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and presence of emphysema along the needle tract. </li>
    <li>The frequency of complications in case series of patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was as follows: pneumothorax was the most commonly reported complication with rates varying from 9% to 54% in 19 case series. Other reported complications after RFA were bleeding (0.7%&ndash;26%), pleural effusion (1.8%&ndash;19%), pneumonia (1.8%&ndash;12%), pleuritis (0.6%&ndash;4.3%), lung abscess (0.3%&ndash;3.1%), haemothorax (3.0%), severe pain (2%), bronchopleural ﬁstula (1.5%&ndash;1.8%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (1.5%) and pericardial tamponade (0.9%). Procedure-related mortality varied from 0% to 0.9% in seven case series, although one series reported a 30-day procedure-related mortality of 2.6%. </li>
    <li>The main acute toxicities of stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) are fatigue, chest pain, skin erythema and cough, but these side effects are almost always mild (&lt;grade 3) and self-limiting. Severe radiation pneumonitis&mdash;that is, grade 3 (requiring oxygen, severe symptoms&plusmn;limiting self-care), is uncommon (range 1%&ndash;2.8%) and grade 2 (symptomatic requiring medical intervention&plusmn;limiting activities of daily living) or less ranges from 1% to 11%. The incidence of radiation pneumonitis does not appear to be higher in patients with poor pulmonary function. Rib fracture and chest wall pain are the main late side effects with varying incidence depending on the dose fractionation scheme used. </li>
    <li>The ﬁnding of a pulmonary nodule has an adverse impact on quality of life.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Patients commonly assume that the ﬁnding of a nodule means that they have cancer. </li>
        <li>Patients may be frustrated if healthcare providers fail to deal with their concerns about cancer or potential adverse effects of surveillance. </li>
        <li>Effective communication by the healthcare team can reduce the impact on quality of life after diagnosis of a pulmonary nodule. </li>
