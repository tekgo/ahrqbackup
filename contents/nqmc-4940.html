<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The effectiveness of rehabilitation services is best understood through repeated measurements of functional outcomes with a consistent, valid, and reliable assessment system. Within post-acute care, there is a growing demand for outcome assessment systems that can monitor interventions and programs on an ongoing basis across diagnostic groups and across the continuum of care settings. A well-accepted approach for addressing this need is the development of a clinical monitoring system designed for outcomes management. As highlighted in the long-range research plan of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, such clinical monitoring systems can provide important information on the outcomes of services to direct ongoing process and outcome improvements.</p>

<p>The Boston University Activity Measure for Post Acute Care (AM-PAC)&#153; is an activity limitations instrument developed using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).  According to the ICF, an activity limitation is defined as "difficulty in the execution of a task or action by an individual."  The AM-PAC&#153; was developed as a functional outcomes system that can be used across post acute care settings and consists of a comprehensive list of 288 functional activities (i.e., the item bank). It measures functional outcome by using contemporary measurement techniques, such as Item Response Theory (IRT), to overcome the limitations of traditional functional outcome measures.  Unlike these traditional functional outcome measures which are disease, condition, or setting-specific, the AM-PAC was designed to be used across patient diagnoses, conditions and settings where post acute care is being provided; therefore, the AM-PAC is the ideal measure for developing benchmarks and for examining functional outcomes over an episode of post acute care, as patients move across care settings.</p></div>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Initially, Activity Measure for Post-acute Care (AM-PAC) test items were administered to a large sample of patients from different care settings with different diagnoses. Factor analytic work identified three distinct, interpretable factors that accounted for 72% of the variance: Applied Cognition (44%), Daily Activities (19%) and Basic Mobility (9%). These factors were verified by a confirmatory factor analysis and defined as the three AM-PAC domains. Using Item Response Theory (IRT), items in each domain were scaled along a continuum of item difficulty. Items that were redundant or did not fit the model were eliminated. The remaining items formed the AM-PAC item banks, which included a wide range of items calibrated along a continuum of difficulty.</p>

<p>Adequate levels of reliability of individual items and validity of the AM-PAC have been established and have been reported.  Refer to the articles referenced in the "Evidence for Reliability/Validity Testing" field for further information.</p></div>
