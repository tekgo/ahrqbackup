<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to improve diagnostic and therapeutic follow-up for osteoporosis of adults presenting with a history of low-impact (fragility) fracture for men and women age 50 or older.</p>
<p>Osteoporosis is a generalized skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength and deterioration of bone quality, often leading to fragility (low trauma) fractures. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines osteoporosis as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations or more below a reference group of young Caucasian females (WHO, 2004). A low bone mass is frequently found, but not required, for the diagnosis. (A fragility fracture, regardless of the bone mass, necessitates the diagnosis.) Osteoporosis is by far the most common bone disease (WHO, 2004). Osteoporosis can be a primary disorder or can be caused by a host of other factors (e.g., diseases, lifestyle, medications, etc.). The impact of this disorder is massive in terms of cost, morbidity and mortality. An estimated 1.5 million individuals suffer a fragility fracture annually (Riggs et al., 1998). An estimated 40% of women and 25% to 33% of men during their lifetime will suffer a hip, spine or wrist fracture in their lifetime (Binkley et al., 2006). Projections indicate a two- to threefold increase in osteoporosis by 2040 (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2012).</p>
<p>The major challenges facing this field currently include low rates of initial screening with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), lack of initial treatment in cases with a high fracture risk, and poor adherence with prescribed treatment.</p>
<p>Osteoporosis risk should be discussed with any adult who has a history of a low-impact (fragility) fracture that may be related to osteoporosis. A low-impact fracture is defined as a fracture occurring spontaneously or from a fall at a height no greater than the patient's standing height. This includes fractures from activities such as a cough, sneeze or abrupt movement (e.g., opening a window), and patients who have prevalent low-impact vertebral compression fracture documentation on radiographs regardless of their degree of symptoms. Many adults do not realize that having one fracture in their adult lifetime indicates an increased risk of future fractures, especially in the first few years following the fracture, and may be an indication for bone density testing. This historical risk factor provides information that may be additive to bone mineral density information. There may be mechanical influences caused by having had one fracture that increase subsequent risk by altering balance and increasing fall risk (Johnell et al., 2004).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Of the types of fractures, the most devastating effects are from hip fractures. Most of these occur after a fall, which are more frequent with aging. The one-year mortality rate of a hip fracture is approximately 28% in women and 35% in men (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2004). Some, but not all, of these deaths would be avoided with preventive interventions. Twenty-five percent of these patients will become disabled, and many will require long-term nursing home placement (Ray, 1997). Given the aging population, the frequency, cost and burden of fractures will continue to increase. </li>
    <li>Annual direct care expenditures for osteoporotic fractures ranged from $12.2 billion to $17.9 billion in 1999. This constitutes 7% of total health care costs for women over the age of 45 (Hoerger, 1999). </li>
    <li>It is estimated that 50% of women over age 50 will develop a fracture in their remaining lifetime and the annualized risk increases with age. Twenty-five percent of women over age 50 will experience an osteoporotic vertebral fracture, so that by age 75 more than one in three women has sustained at least one vertebral fracture. </li>
</ul>
