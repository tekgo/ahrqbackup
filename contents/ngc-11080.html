<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Literature Review</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction/Background</strong></p>
<p>Hematospermia (HS) or hemospermia, the presence of blood in the ejaculate or semen, has been recognized for centuries. Although it is not uncommon to encounter HS in clinical practice, the exact prevalence and incidence are not known. Most men with HS are young (&lt;40 years of age), and HS may occur either as a single episode or repeatedly over time. It is typically a cause of great anxiety to men, mainly due to the imagined possibility of underlying malignancy or venereal disease. HS may be associated with pathology in the prostate gland, seminal tract (seminal vesicles, vasa deferentia, and ejaculatory ducts), verumontanum, urethra, urinary bladder, epididymis, or testes, with cited causes reported to include prior prostatic biopsy, prostatic calculi, inflammatory or infectious conditions such as prostatitis or seminal vesiculitis, ductal obstruction, prostatic cyst formation, and rarely vascular malformations. The majority of cases of HS were thought to be idiopathic in nature; however, as a result of improved imaging techniques, the number of cases labeled as idiopathic has decreased significantly, with one of the main sites of bleeding occurring in the seminal vesicles. Of specific etiologies, infectious or inflammatory conditions are the most common, accounting for approximately 40% of HS cases overall. An infectious or inflammatory condition of the urogenital tract is the most common etiology in men &lt;40 years of age.</p>
<p>Malignant tumors are infrequently associated with HS but need to be excluded in men &ge;40 years of age. In one study involving 26,126 men who underwent routine prostate cancer screening, only 0.5% had HS, but 13.7% who reported HS were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Moreover, the presence of HS was shown to be a significant predictor of prostate cancer diagnosis (odds ratio =1.73) after adjusting for age, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and digital rectal examination results through a logistic regression model. Other studies have reported a lower percentage of prostate cancer in men &ge;40 years of age presenting with HS, ranging from 2.6% to 6%. Therefore, when a man &ge;40 years of age presents with HS, screening for prostate cancer is recommended. Furthermore, when HS is persistent or refractory or has concomitant urological tract symptoms, noninvasive imaging and other diagnostic testing are typically performed to exclude an underlying correctible etiology, which includes obstruction or stricture at the level of the verumontanum, calculi, and cysts.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Imaging Modalities</strong></p>
<p><em>Transrectal Ultrasound (Ultrasound Pelvis [Prostate] Transrectal)</em></p>
<p>Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is a safe, inexpensive, effective, noninvasive, radiation-free imaging technique often used as the primary screening or diagnostic modality in men with HS to evaluate the prostate gland and seminal tract. Patients are typically placed in left lateral decubitus position, and grayscale images are obtained with a 5.0- to 10-MHz TRUS transducer in axial and sagittal planes. Color and power Doppler images may also be acquired, particularly when prostate cancer is suspected and prostatic biopsy is contemplated. TRUS-guided aspiration or biopsy of the seminal vesicles or prostate gland may be performed to further elucidate the site of bleeding, to provide a definitive diagnosis if a lesion is detected, or to confirm the presence of ejaculatory duct obstruction.</p>
<p><em>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</em></p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its excellent soft-tissue contrast, provides radiation-free multiplanar, high-spatial-resolution anatomic evaluation of the prostate gland and seminal tract. Imaging should be performed at either 1.5T or 3T, although there is no consensus at this time on the appropriate coil selection or field strength. The fundamental advantage of 3T over 1.5T is increased signal-to-noise ratio, which improves the spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. Comparable performance between multichannel phased array coil MRI of the prostate at 3T and endorectal phased array coil MRI at 1.5T has been reported. As opposed to TRUS, MRI is operator independent and can be performed when TRUS is unsatisfactory or nondiagnostic. Subsequently, small field-of-view axial T1-weighted images and axial, sagittal, and coronal T2-weighted images are obtained for high-resolution evaluation of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, and ampullary portions of the vasa deferentia, followed by large field-of-view images to evaluate for pelvic lymphadenopathy. The increasing availability of 3T MRI, which offers a higher signal-to-noise ratio and improved spatial resolution, may preclude the use of an endorectal coil for evaluating the seminal tract.</p>
<p><em>Computed Tomography</em></p>
<p>Computed tomography (CT) is a noninvasive imaging modality that uses ionizing radiation to identify calcifications, gross soft-tissue masses, or cystic lesions of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. However, it has limited value in the etiologic determination of HS given its lack of soft-tissue contrast and limitation in differentiating structural changes of the prostate and seminal tract.</p>
<p><em>Pelvic Angiography</em></p>
<p>Pelvic angiography can be useful to evaluate for vascular causes of HS and is mainly reserved for men with intractable HS with or without hematuria when clinical, laboratory, and noninvasive imaging evaluations have not revealed an etiology. If an arterial source of hemorrhage is identified, such as from the internal pudendal artery, transcatheter arterial embolization may be performed in the same session for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Imaging Modalities by Variant</strong></p>
<p>Factors that determine the extent of investigation are patient age, duration of HS, and associated symptoms and signs. However, a confounding issue is that currently there are no consensus or society guidelines on the distinction between transient or episodic HS and persistent HS. The distinction has been based on either the number of ejaculates or a specific time period, with differing opinions. Ultimately the decision to pursue further investigation will be made by the referring physician, typically a urologist.</p>
<p><em>Variant 1: Man &lt;40 Years of Age, Transient or Episodic Hematospermia, and No Other Symptoms or Signs of Disease</em></p>
<p>Imaging assessment is not generally recommended for this patient population because watchful waiting, reassurance, and routine clinical evaluation may suffice, given that HS is apt to be a benign and self-limited condition unassociated with a significant underlying disease process. The approach to any patient with HS begins with a detailed history and physical examination. Determination of the origin of bleeding within the ejaculate is vital, as postcoital hemorrhage from the patient's sexual partner may sometimes be mistaken for HS. Laboratory testing includes visual analysis of the ejaculate for red discoloration, microbiological testing, semen analysis, urinalysis and urine culture, and assessment of serum coagulation, a serum chemistry panel, and a complete blood count.</p>
<p><em>Variant 2: Man Age &ge;40 Years of Age, or Man of Any Age with Persistent Hematospermia, or Hematospermia Accompanied by Associated Symptoms or Signs of Disease</em></p>
<p>Noninvasive imaging techniques, predominantly TRUS and MRI, are recommended in patients &ge;40 years of age with persistent or refractory HS or other associated symptoms or signs of disease. All patients &ge;40 years of age should be screened for prostate cancer by checking a PSA level. Although not addressed by the medical literature, TRUS or pelvic MRI can be performed to allay anxiety and provide reassurance that no significant pathology exists in patients with negative history and physical examination.</p>
<p><em>TRUS</em></p>
<p>Many investigators have reported that TRUS should be used as the first-line imaging tool in this patient population. TRUS is very sensitive for detecting a variety of abnormalities that may involve the prostate gland and seminal tract in the setting of HS, reportedly demonstrating abnormalities in 82% to 95% of men with HS. Abnormalities may include calcifications or calculi in the prostate, ejaculatory ducts, or seminal vesicles; seminal vesicle, ejaculatory duct, or prostatic cysts; benign prostatic hypertrophy; prostatitis; and Cowper gland masses. However, it is important to consider that some of these abnormalities can be found in asymptomatic patients, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic calcifications, which are age-related changes, and nonobstructing prostatic cysts. TRUS has shown utility in guiding transperineal aspiration of the seminal vesicles. A recent prospective trial enrolled 106 patients with persistent HS and found the diagnostic accuracy of TRUS and transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy was 45.3% and 74.5%, respectively, although the diagnostic accuracy was higher when both modalities were combined. Vesiculoscopy was most useful in the detection of calculi and obstruction/stricture at the level of the verumontanum orifice or ejaculatory duct.</p>
<p><em>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</em></p>
<p>MRI has been recommended when TRUS results are negative or inconclusive. It should be emphasized that MRI has no established role in screening for prostate cancer; the utility of MRI in this patient population is in demonstrating anatomic abnormalities in the prostate gland and ejaculatory tract that may be accounting for the HS. The multiplanar ability of MRI to accurately depict structural changes in the prostate, seminal vesicles, ampulla of vas deferens, and ejaculatory ducts has enabled the modality to be particularly useful in determining the organ of origin of midline or paramedian prostatic cysts and to provide more accurate causative information compared to TRUS regarding ejaculatory duct obstruction and location and age of hemorrhage within the seminal tract. Seminal vesicle width &ge;1.7 cm or tubular duct diameter &gt;5 mm is consistent with dilatation or enlargement and more likely caused by distal ejaculatory duct obstruction in the setting of persistent HS. This information aids in determining optimal surgical management in cases of transurethral resection of the ejaculatory duct or appropriate selection of ejaculatory duct orifice for cannulation during vesiculoscopy.</p>
<p><em>Computed Tomography</em></p>
<p>CT has very limited value in the etiologic determination of HS for the reasons described above.</p>
<p><em>Pelvic Angiography</em></p>
<p>Angiography has been reported sparsely in the literature to be useful for vascular masses when evaluating men with intractable HS with or without hematuria when clinical, laboratory, and noninvasive imaging evaluations have not revealed the etiology. If an arterial source of hemorrhage is identified, transcatheter arterial embolization may be performed during the same session as well.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>HS is an anxiety-provoking but otherwise generally benign and self-limited condition that is infrequently associated with significant underlying pathology, and is most often considered to be idiopathic in nature. </li>
    <li>Watchful waiting, reassurance, and routine clinical evaluation typically suffice in men &lt;40 years of age with transient HS and no other symptoms or signs of disease. When a cause can be identified, infection of the urogenital tract is the most common etiology of HS in men &lt;40 years of age. </li>
    <li>Noninvasive imaging techniques, predominantly TRUS and MRI, can be used in men &ge;40 years of age or men of any age with persistent or refractory HS or other associated symptoms or signs of disease. In men &ge;40 years of age who have HS, screening for prostate cancer is advised. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rating Appropriateness</span></strong></p>
<p>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria (AC) methodology is based on the RAND Appropriateness Method. The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures or treatments included in the AC topics are determined using a modified Delphi method. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. The expert panel members review the evidence presented and assess the risks or harms of doing the procedure balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure. The direct or indirect costs of a procedure are not considered as a risk or harm when determining appropriateness. When the evidence for a specific topic and variant is uncertain or incomplete, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence or may be the sole source for assessing the appropriateness.</p>
<p>The appropriateness is represented on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category "usually not appropriate" where the harms of doing the procedure outweigh the benefits; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category "usually appropriate" where the benefits of doing a procedure outweigh the harms or risks. The middle category, designated "may be appropriate," is represented by 4, 5, or 6 on the scale. The middle category is when the risks and benefits are equivocal or unclear, the dispersion of the individual ratings from the group median rating is too large (i.e., disagreement), the evidence is contradictory or unclear, or there are special circumstances or subpopulations which could influence the risks or benefits that are embedded in the variant.</p>
<p>The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating. To determine the panel's recommendation, the rating category that contains the median group rating without disagreement is selected. This may be determined after either the first or second rating round. If there is disagreement after the second rating round, the recommendation is "May be appropriate."</p>
<p>This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to articulate his or her individual interpretations of the evidence or expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized, and economical process. For additional information on the ratings process see the <a href="http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/RatingRoundInfo.pdf" title="ACR Web site">Rating Round Information</a> document.</p>
<p>Additional methodology documents, including a more detailed explanation of the complete topic development process and all ACR AC topics can be found on the <a href="http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Appropriateness-Criteria" title="ACR Web site">ACR Web site</a> (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Potential Harms

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relative Radiation Level Information</span></strong></p>
<p>Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria&reg; Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p></div>

Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination. </li>
    <li>ACR seeks and encourages collaboration with other organizations on the development of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria through society representation on expert panels. Participation by representatives from collaborating societies on the expert panel does not necessarily imply society endorsement of the final document. </li>
