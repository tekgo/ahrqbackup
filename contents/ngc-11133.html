    <li>The health care organization should provide a surgical smoke-free work environment. </li>
    <li>The perioperative team should evacuate all surgical smoke. </li>
    <li>Perioperative team members should receive initial and ongoing education and competency verification on surgical smoke safety. </li>
    <li>Policies and procedures for surgical smoke safety should be developed, reviewed periodically, revised as necessary, and readily available in the practice setting in which they are used. </li>
    <li>Perioperative personnel should participate in a variety of quality assurance and performance improvement activities that are consistent with the health care organization's plan to improve understanding and compliance with the principles and processes of surgical smoke evacuation. </li>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evidence Review</span></strong></p>
<p>A medical librarian conducted systematic searches of the databases MEDLINE&reg;, CINAHL&reg;, Scopus&reg;, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Results were limited to literature published in English from January 1985 to November 2015. During the development of the guideline, the lead author requested additional articles that either did not fit the original search criteria or were discovered during the evidence appraisal process, and the lead author and the medical librarian identified relevant guidelines from government agencies and standards-setting bodies. Updated searches were completed in January 2016.</p>
<p>Search terms related to procedures included the subject headings and keywords <em>diathermy, cautery, laser, electrosurgery,</em> and <em>surgical procedures, operative</em>. Search terms and keywords related to by-products included <em>smoke, plume, fume, exhaust, mist, particulate matter, bioaerosols, aerosols, smoke evacuation, smoke extractor,</em> and <em>occupational air pollutants</em>.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were research and non-research literature in English, complete publications, and publication dates within the time restriction unless none were available. Excluded were non-peer-reviewed publications and literature on surgical smoke safety. Letters and editorials were excluded. Low-quality evidence was excluded when higher-quality evidence was available, and literature outside the time restriction was excluded when literature within the time restriction was available.</p></div>

The literature was independently evaluated and appraised according to the strength and quality of the evidence. Each article was then assigned an appraisal score. The appraisal score is noted in brackets after each reference in the original guideline document, as applicable.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>The collective evidence supporting each intervention within a specific recommendation was summarized, and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Evidence Rating Model (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field) was used to rate the strength of the evidence. Factors considered in the review of the collective evidence were the quality of the evidence, the quantity of similar evidence on a given topic, and the consistency of evidence supporting a recommendation. The evidence rating is noted in brackets after each intervention in the original guideline document.</p></div>
