Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adolescents 13 years of age who had one dose of meningococcal vaccine and one tetanus, diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) or one tetanus, diphtheria toxoids vaccine (Td) by their 13th birthday.</p>
<p>The Immunizations for Adolescents (IMA) measure calculates a rate for each vaccine and one combination rate. This measure summary represents the overall rate.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note from the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse (NQMC)</strong>: For this measure, there are both Administrative and Hybrid Specifications. This NQMC measure summary is based on the Administrative specification. Refer to the original measure documentation for details pertaining to the Hybrid specification. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Adolescent immunization rates have historically lagged behind early childhood immunization rates in the United States (U.S.). In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reported that 3 million adolescents failed to receive at least one recommended vaccination (Kroger et al., 2006). Low immunization rates among adolescents have the potential to cause outbreaks of preventable diseases and to establish reservoirs of disease in adolescents that can affect other populations including infants, the elderly, and individuals with chronic conditions. Immunization recommendations for adolescents have changed in recent years. In addition to assessing for immunizations that may have been missed, there are new vaccines targeted specifically to adolescents.</p>
<p>This measure follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (CDC/ACIP) guidelines for immunizations (Kroger et al., 2006).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Receiving recommended vaccinations is the best defense against vaccine-preventable diseases, including meningococcal meningitis, tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], "Meningococcal disease," 2014; CDC, 2012). These are serious diseases that can cause breathing difficulties, heart problems, nerve damage, pneumonia, seizures and even death (CDC, "2014 recommended immunizations," 2014). Immunizing adolescents is an important way to prevent serious illnesses for which we have effective vaccines. </li>
    <li>Vaccine-preventable diseases are expensive for society as a whole&ndash;they cost more than $10 billion in direct medical costs and indirect societal costs (National Foundation for Infectious Diseases [NFID], 2013).</li>
    <li>In 2012, 48,777 pertussis cases and 20 pertussis-related deaths in the United States were reported to the CDC (World Health Organization [WHO], 2012).</li>
    <li>Meningococcal meningitis can cause severe brain damage and is fatal in half of untreated cases (WHO, 2012). Meningitis was responsible for 608 deaths in the United States in 2010 (Murphy, Xu, &amp; Kochanek, 2013).</li>
    <li>Vaccines are a safe and effective way to protect adolescents against potentially deadly diseases (NFID, 2013).</li>
