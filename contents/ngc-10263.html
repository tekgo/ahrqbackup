<h3>
Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The recommendations outlined in this guideline apply to all women with ovarian germ cell tumours.</p>
<p>Staging is based on the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obst&eacute;trique (FIGO) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). A detailed description of staging can be found in the Appendix in the original guideline document.</p>
<p>The recommendations were developed after a review of recommendations from the following sources: the National Cancer Institute, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and Cancer Care Ontario.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Point</span></strong></p>
<p>A unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with preservation of the contralateral ovary and uterus for fertility purposes with a full staging procedure is the recommended procedure for germ cell tumours in women of child-bearing age wishing to preserve fertility, even in the presence of metastatic disease.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management Options</span></strong></p>
<p>Recommendations for family physicians or general gynecologists with a young prepubertal and reproductive age female presenting with a complex pelvic mass on examination include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Imaging (ultrasound [US] abdomen and pelvis, and/or computed tomography [CT] chest/abdomen/pelvis) </li>
    <li>Tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], cancer antigen [CA-125]) in patients less than 40 years of age </li>
    <li>Referral to gynecologic oncologist </li>
</ul>
<p>When germ cell tumours are suspected based on preoperative work up, in addition to unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, surgical staging is performed and should include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Washings </li>
    <li>Unilateral pelvic and para aortic lymph node sampling </li>
    <li>Peritoneal biopsies and omentectomy </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage I Tumours</strong></p>
<p><em>Dysgerminomas</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with preservation of the contralateral ovary and uterus for fertility purposes with a full staging procedure. If patient has completed child bearing, total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is acceptable. </li>
    <li>Stage IA tumours: observation without adjuvant treatment </li>
    <li>Stage IB/C or incompletely staged: adjuvant chemotherapy </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Immature Teratomas</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

    <li>Chemotherapy </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chemotherapy Regimen</strong></span></p>
<p>For the following tumours: dysgerminomas (stage II&ndash;IV), embryonal tumours, endodermal sinus tumours, and immature teratomas (stage I, grade 2/3, or stage II&ndash;IV)</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A combination of cisplatin and etoposide (EP) or bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) is preferred because of a lower relapse rate and shorter treatment time. </li>
    <li>3 day regimen:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Cisplatin: 35 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in 250 cc normal saline (NS) days 1, 2, 3 </li>
        <li>Etoposide: 165 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in 1000 cc NS days 1, 2, 3 </li>
        <li>Bleomycin: 30 U in 100 cc NS days 1, 8, 15 </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>5 day regimen:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>BEP: bleomycin (30 units/week); etoposide (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for days 1&ndash;5); cisplatin (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for days 1&ndash;5) </li>
        <li>EP: etoposide (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for days 1&ndash;5); cisplatin (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for days 1&ndash;5) </li>
        <li>The number of cycles is dependent on the prognosis (see table below):
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>For "good prognosis" BEP for 3 cycles or EP for 4 cycles is recommended </li>
            <li>For "intermediate/poor prognosis" BEP for 4 cycles is recommended </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Patients who do not respond to BEP may benefit from the following as salvage therapy (TIP):
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Cisplatin 35 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1, 2, 3 </li>
        <li>Ifosfamide 2 gm/m<sup>2</sup> days 2, 3, 4 </li>
        <li>Taxol 135 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Chemotherapy is effective and allows for reproductive preservation in patients with an intact ovary, tube, and uterus; radiation therapy is used for patients in whom chemotherapy is not considered appropriate (i.e., central nervous system [CNS] disease). </li>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Supportive Care for Myelosuppression</strong></span></p>
<p>The decision to provide supportive care should be based on the patient's risk assessment for chemotherapy-induced toxicities, such as febrile neutropenia, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Treatment options available for select patients include amifostine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF). Indications for the use of these options are included in the recommendations below.</p>
<p><em>Prophylactic Antibiotic</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>If prophylactic antibiotics are being considered, use ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally [po] twice daily [bid]) for 10 days starting on day 8 (days 8&ndash;17); if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is 0.5 or greater on day 1. If the ANC is &lt;0.5 on day 1, chemo is started but with ciprofloxacin (500 mg po bid) on days 1&ndash;17 (Herbst et al., 2009). </li>
    <li>An alternative option is Septra. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Granulocyte CSF</em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Indications:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>To maintain dose intensity when there is evidence of an impact on improved survival or to avoid multiple dose reductions </li>
        <li>To decrease the severity of fever, antibiotic use, or hospitalization associated with febrile neutropenia </li>
        <li>To avoid infection-associated complications when there is a clear risk and the patient presents with febrile neutropenia during a chemotherapy cycle; if the patient was already taking prophylactic CSF, the treatment should be continue </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Recommendation: prophylactic CSF should not be routinely administered with standard-dose chemotherapy for solid tumours; however, when the anticipated risk of febrile neutropenia and/or medical consequences from febrile neutropenia is high, prophylactic CSF may be considered.
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Risk of febrile neutropenia is dependent on (Herbst et al., 2009):
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Disease type </li>
            <li>Chemotherapy regimen (for germ cell tumours, BEP is considered to have a risk &gt;20%) </li>
            <li>Patient risk factors (i.e., age 65 years and older, history of previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, pre-existing neutropenia or bone marrow involvement with tumour, pre-existing infection/open wounds, recent surgery, poor performance status, poor renal function, liver dysfunction and elevated bilirubin, and treatment intent, curative vs. palliative) </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Myeloid growth factors:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Agents
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Filgrastim: 5 mcg/kg/d until post-nadir ANC recovery to normal or near-normal levels by laboratory standards </li>
            <li>Pegfilgrastim: 6 mg (one dose) per cycle of treatment; start 24 hours after completion of last dose of chemotherapy </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Administration: subcutaneous route is preferred </li>
        <li>Alternative dosing schedules in intermediate and high risk patients is not recommended </li>
        <li>Safety is similar between filgrastim and pegfilgrastim </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Follow-up and Surveillance</strong></span></p>
<p>Dysgerminomas (stage I) and immature teratomas (stage I, grade I): observe</p>
<p>Dysgerminomas (stage II&ndash;IV), embryonal tumours, endodermal sinus tumours, and immature teratomas (stage I, grade 2/3 or stage II&ndash;IV):</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>If a complete clinical response is achieved, observe markers q 3 months, if markers are initially elevated, observe for 2 years
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Abdominal/pelvic exam </li>
        <li>Abdominal/pelvic CT if clinically indicated at discretion of the treating physician </li>
        <li>Chest x-ray (CXR) at discretion of the treating physician </li>
        <li>Beta-HCG, AFP, LDH, as clinically indicated </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If there is a residual tumour on radiographic imaging but markers are normal, consider performing a surgical resection or observe </li>
    <li>After 2 years from completing treatment, visits q 6 months </li>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>Specific research questions to be addressed by the guideline document were formulated by the guideline lead(s) and Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist using the PICO question format (Patient or Population, Intervention, Comparisons, Outcomes).</p>
<p><strong>Guideline Questions</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>Are four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) as effective as standard therapy with three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) with fewer and/or less severe side effects, such as myelosuppression? </li>
    <li>What support care should be offered to patients with myelosuppression due to chemotherapy and for how long? </li>
    <li>How should patients be followed up? What tests and frequency of testing are appropriate and for how long? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Search Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Entries to Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane (1965 to March 6, 2009) and clinical practice guideline databases were searched for evidence relevant to this topic. Search terms included: ovary* OR ovarian* AND germ cell OR dysgerminoma OR teratoma OR neoplasm AND (1) neutropenia OR myelosuppression AND granulocyte colony stimulating factor OR antibiotics; or (2) chemotherapy OR bleomycin OR etoposide OR cisplatin, with a limit of English language.</p>
<p>The guideline was updated in 2012 and again in 2013 using the following search: PubMed was searched using the terms "ovarian germ cell tumour" or "ovarian dysgerminoma" or "ovarian teratoma." Results were limited to clinical trials, published through March 2013. Citations were hand-searched for relevant studies, resulting in a total of five retrospective studies in 2012 and two randomized controlled trials and two retrospective studies in 2013.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was selected and reviewed by a working group comprised of members from the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Team and a Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist from the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU). A detailed description of the methodology followed during the guideline development process can be found in the GURU Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Tables</strong></p>
<p>Evidence tables containing the first author, year of publication, patient group/stage of disease, methodology, and main outcomes of interest are assembled using the studies identified in the literature search. Existing guidelines on the topic are assessed by the KM Specialist using portions of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument (<a href="http://www.agreetrust.org" title="AGREE Web site">http://www.agreetrust.org</a>) and those meeting the minimum requirements are included in the evidence document. Due to limited resources, GURU does not regularly employ the use of multiple reviewers to rank the level of evidence; rather, the methodology portion of the evidence table contains the pertinent information required for the reader to judge for himself the quality of the studies.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Formulating Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The working group members formulated the guideline recommendations based on the evidence synthesized by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist during the planning process, blended with expert clinical interpretation of the evidence. As detailed in the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit Handbook (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), the working group members may decide to adopt the recommendations of another institution without any revisions, adapt the recommendations of another institution or institutions to better reflect local practices, or develop their own set of recommendations by adapting some, but not all, recommendations from different guidelines.</p>
<p>The degree to which a recommendation is based on expert opinion of the working group and/or the Provincial Tumour Team members is explicitly stated in the guideline recommendations. Similar to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) methodology for formulating guideline recommendations, the Guideline Utilization Resource Unit (GURU) does not use formal rating schemes for describing the strength of the recommendations, but rather describes, in conventional and explicit language, the type and quality of the research and existing guidelines that were taken into consideration when formulating the recommendations.</p>
<p>Following a review of the evidence by the Alberta Gynecologic Oncology Team, no major changes were made to the recommendations and the guideline was reaffirmed.</p></div>

Description of Method of Guideline Validation
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline was reviewed and endorsed by the Alberta Provincial Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Team.</p>
<p>When the draft guideline document has been completed, revised, and reviewed by the Knowledge Management (KM) Specialist and the working group members, it will be sent to all members of the Provincial Tumour Team for review and comment. This step ensures that those intended to use the guideline have the opportunity to review the document and identify potential difficulties for implementation before the guideline is finalized. Depending on the size of the document, and the number of people it is sent to for review, a deadline of one to two weeks will usually be given to submit any feedback. Ideally, this review will occur prior to the annual Provincial Tumour Team meeting, and a discussion of the proposed edits will take place at the meeting. The working group members will then make final revisions to the document based on the received feedback, as appropriate. Once the guideline is finalized, it will be officially endorsed by the Provincial Tumour Team Lead and the Executive Director of Provincial Tumour Programs.</p></div>

Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Chemotherapy-related toxicities such as febrile neutropenia, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and toxicity-related mortality </li>
    <li>There are risks associated with use of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) including, most notably, acute impacts on bone health. Therefore, recommendations on the use of prophylactic CSF remain conservative. Prophylactic CSF should not be routinely administered with standard-dose chemotherapy for solid tumours; however, when the anticipated risk of febrile neutropenia and/or medical consequences from febrile neutropenia is high, prophylactic CSF may be considered.</li>
    <li>Amifostine is associated with side effects, such as nausea and vomiting and hypotension; therefore, the benefits of treating these toxicities should be weighed against the side effects and amifostine should not be included routinely in treatment regimens for the purpose of dose maintenance of chemotherapy or for protection against thrombocytopenia.</li>
