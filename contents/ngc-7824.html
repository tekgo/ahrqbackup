<div class="content_para"><p>Definitions of the levels of the recommendations (<strong>A, B, C, U</strong>) and classification of the evidence (<strong>Class I-IV</strong>) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p>For patients with dementia, consider the following characteristics useful for identifying patients at increased risk for unsafe driving:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (<strong>Level A</strong>) </li>
    <li>A caregiver's rating of a patient's driving ability as marginal or unsafe (<strong>Level B</strong>) </li>
    <li>A history of traffic citations (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>A history of crashes (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Reduced driving mileage (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Self-reported situational avoidance (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores of &le;24 (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
    <li>Aggressive or impulsive personality characteristics (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>For patients with dementia, consider the following characteristics not useful for identifying patients at increased risk for unsafe driving:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A patient's self-rating of safe driving ability (<strong>Level A</strong>) </li>
    <li>Lack of situational avoidance (<strong>Level C</strong>) </li>
</ul>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the benefit of neuropsychological testing, after controlling for the presence and severity of dementia, or interventional strategies for drivers with dementia (<strong>Level U</strong>).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Definitions</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> = Established as effective, ineffective, or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> = Probably effective, ineffective, or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> = Possibly effective, ineffective, or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)</p>
<p><strong>Level U</strong> = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.</p>
<p class="Note">*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome &gt;5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is &gt;2).</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Evidence for Diagnostic Accuracy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class I</strong> = A cohort study with prospective data collection of a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition, using an acceptable reference standard for case definition. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class II</strong> = A case control study of a broad spectrum of persons with the condition established by an acceptable reference standard compared to a broad spectrum of controls or a cohort study where a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition where the data was collected retrospectively. The diagnostic test is objective or performed and interpreted without knowledge of disease status. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class III</strong> = A case control study or cohort study where either persons with the condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum. The condition is established by an acceptable reference standard. The reference standard and diagnostic test are objective or performed and interpreted by different observers. Study results allow calculation of measures of diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Class IV</strong> = Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>Relevant articles published between 1970 and December 2006 were identified using the search strategy listed in appendix e-3 on the Neurology&reg; Web site at <a href="http://www.neurology.org" title="Neurology Journal Web site">www.neurology.org</a>.</p>
<p>The lead author and a university research librarian searched the Medline database for relevant articles with English abstracts published between 1970 and December 2006. The search strategy is listed on the <a href="http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/full/WNL.0b013e3181da3b0f/DC1?maxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=driving+risk&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT" title="Neurology Journal Web site">Neurology&reg; Web site</a>. A second computer-assisted search examined CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, PsycInfo, Global Health, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, NTIS, Health and Safety Science Abstracts, Risk Abstracts, Web of Science, Ageline, WorldCat, and TRIS. Next, the SafetyLit database was searched using the keyword "driving" (only one search word is permitted). A secondary bibliography search of all full-text articles was performed.</p>
<p>Sources were excluded if they:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Did not present primary research findings. </li>
    <li>Included drivers who had confounding medical conditions such as major psychiatric diseases, vestibular disorders, alcoholism, or other forms of drug addiction. </li>
    <li>Pertained only to driving with visual impairment that is not caused by some neurological disorder (e.g., homonymous hemianopia with stroke). </li>
</ul>
<p>Sources were included if they:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Pertained to automobile driving. </li>
    <li>Had driving (either on road, in a driving simulator, or other computer-simulated aspects of driving) as an outcome measure. </li>
    <li>Involve persons with some type of neurological condition, which includes aging. </li>
</ul>
<p>Of approximately 6,000 studies identified by the search strategy, 422 were selected for full-text review. A secondary bibliography search yielded 80 additional references.</p>

Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>All eligible articles were rated by one Quality Standards Subcommittee (QSS) member and one author panel member, using the 4-tiered scheme for rating a diagnostic study's risk of bias (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Differences between reviewers were adjudicated by a second QSS member.</p>
<p>The panel reviewed studies of patients with dementia of any cause or mild cognitive impairment. Population studies of aged drivers without an a priori diagnosis of dementia were accepted for analysis when studies limited to drivers with dementia were unavailable or inconclusive. The justification for this is based on the strong correlation between aging and dementia, and the fact that these studies frequently identified individuals with cognitive impairment without a previous diagnosis of dementia. To account for spectrum bias, such studies were downgraded by one evidence class, per QSS precedent.</p>
<p>The panel considered standardized on-road driving tests (ORDTs) to be the most valid measure. State-administered ORDTs are the de facto legal determinant of driving ability. Driving simulator studies can evaluate driving behavior in (simulated) dangerous circumstances, but have varying degrees of standardization and validity. Crash data are somewhat insensitive, because not all certifiably unsafe drivers have had a crash, and nonspecific, because not all drivers with an at-fault crash are unsafe drivers.</p>
<p>Cohort studies were judged to have a narrow spectrum if they excluded subjects based upon the value of a predictor variable (e.g., a study of the predictive ability of the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] that excluded subjects with MMSE scores less than 25). Case-control studies were judged to have a narrow spectrum if they excluded equivocal outcomes (e.g., a study of at-fault crashes that excluded crashes with indeterminate at fault status).</p></div>

</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2010 Guideline</span></strong></p>
<p>American Academy of Neurology (AAN) invited neurologists, a neuropsychologist, an occupational therapist with content domain expertise, and neurologists with methodologic expertise to perform this review.</p>
<p>This practice parameter is an update of the 2000 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter on driving and dementia. In addition, this parameter seeks to identify historical features that are associated with increased driving risk. The following clinical questions were developed:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>How strongly are global measures of dementia severity associated with decreased driving ability? </li>
    <li>To what extent are patients and their caregivers able to assess driving ability and risk? </li>
    <li>Which elements of the driving history are associated with decreased driving ability? </li>
    <li>Which neuropsychological tests provide additional prognostic information? </li>
    <li>Are there any interventions that reduce driving risk? </li>
</ol>
<p>The strength of the practice recommendations was directly linked to the class of evidence using the scheme described in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2013 Reaffirmation</span></strong></p>
<p>An author conducted a literature search using the same criteria as presented in the original guideline. Because the guideline recommendations would not changes given the new literature available, the committee voted to reaffirm the guideline, stating that the conclusions and recommendations are still valid.</p></div>

    <li>This statement is provided as an educational service of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). It is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. It is not intended to include all possible proper methods of care for a particular neurologic problem or all legitimate criteria for choosing to use a specific procedure. Neither is it intended to exclude any reasonable alternative methodologies. The AAN recognizes that specific patient care decisions are the prerogative of the patient and the physician caring for the patient, based on all of the circumstances involved. The clinical context section is made available in order to place the evidence-based guideline(s) into perspective with current practice habits and challenges. No formal practice recommendations should be inferred. </li>
    <li>Qualitative risk estimates, based on imperfect data, are a familiar part of clinical practice. However, clinicians may be less comfortable making such judgments in a legal context; for example, to comply with mandatory state reporting of dementia that "could" (Pennsylvania), "may" (Oregon), or "is likely to" (California) result in driving impairment. When the threshold for "likely" impairment is low (e.g., CA: "inability to perform one or more functions of daily living") or unclear, some clinicians may choose to report borderline cases. In some states, doing so may leave them open to civil litigation. This practice parameter cannot operationalize these types of subjective statutory requirements; it is intended for use in a clinical setting to assist in an evidence-based estimate of driving risk. </li>

<p>The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is committed to producing independent, critical and truthful clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Significant efforts are made to minimize the potential for conflicts of interests to influence the recommendation of this CPG. To the extent possible, the AAN keeps separate those who have a financial stake in the success or failure of the products appraised in the CPGs and the developers of the guidelines. Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN limits the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest. The AAN forbids commercial participation in, or funding of, guideline projects. Drafts of the guidelines have been reviewed by at least three AAN committees, a network of neurologists, Neurology&reg; peer reviewers, and representatives from related fields. The AAN Guideline Author Conflict of Interest Policy can be viewed at <a href="http://www.aan.com" title="AAN Web site">www.aan.com</a>.</p>
