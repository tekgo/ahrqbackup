<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Patient education regarding the symptoms and treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), its effects on functioning (including relationships, work, etc.) and the effect of healthy behaviors on depression can greatly aid in a patient's understanding of their depression and their adherence to treatment. Patient education allows patients to become more knowledgeable and engaged with their treatment. Psychoeducational strategies should be incorporated into structured and organized treatment protocols, which entail systematic monitoring of treatment adherence and response and self-management strategies.</p>
<p>One of the key factors in nonadherence to MDD treatment is failure of patients to receive explanation of diagnosis and causes of illness. Ongoing patient education, whether verbal or written, is very important in improving treatment adherence for patients with MDD. At regular patient visits, clinicians should reinforce patient education, the need for continued MDD treatment, possible treatment modification, and assessment of adherence. In addition, clinicians should educate patients and their families to self-assess for symptoms and risk for recurrent MDD episodes.</p>
<p><strong>The following evidence statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim </span>from the referenced clinical guidelines. Only selected portions of the clinical guidelines are quoted here; for more details, please refer to the full guideline</strong>.</p>
<p>Education about the symptoms and treatment of major depressive disorder should be provided in language that is readily understandable to the patient (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2010).</p>
<p>With the patient's permission, family members and others involved in the patient's day-to-day life may also benefit from education about the illness, its effects on functioning (including family and other interpersonal relationships), and its treatment (APA, 2010). </p>
<p>Education about major depressive disorder should address the need for a full acute course of treatment, the risk of relapse, the early recognition of recurrent symptoms, and the need to seek treatment as early as possible to reduce the risk of complications or a full-blown episode of major depression (APA, 2010). </p>
<p>Patient education also includes general promotion of healthy behaviors such as exercise, good sleep hygiene, good nutrition, and decreased use of tobacco, alcohol, and other potentially deleterious substances (APA, 2010).</p>
<p>Educational tools such as books, pamphlets, and trusted web sites can augment the face-to-face education provided by the clinician (APA, 2010). </p>
<p>Psychoeducation should be provided for individuals with depression at all levels of severity and in all care settings and should be provided both verbally and with written educational materials (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009).</p>
<p>There should be education on the nature of depression and its treatment options (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009).</p>
<p>Education should incorporate principles of self-management and may include information and goals related to: Nutrition, Exercise, Bibliotherapy, Sleep hygiene, Tobacco use, Caffeine use, Alcohol use and abuse, and Pleasurable activities (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009).</p>
<p>Psychoeducational strategies should be incorporated into structured and organized treatment protocols, which entail structured systematic monitoring of treatment adherence and response and self-management strategies (Management of MDD Working Group, 2009).</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Prevalence and Incidence</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depressive disorder affects approximately 14.8 million American adults, or about 6.7 percent of the U.S. population aged 18 and older in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2010). </li>
    <li>While major depressive disorder can develop at any age, the median age at onset is 32 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>Major depressive disorder is more prevalent in women than in men (NIMH, 2010). </li>
    <li>Depressive disorders are more common among persons with chronic conditions (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and cancer) and among those with unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical inactivity, and binge drinking) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disability</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. for ages 15 to 44 (NIMH, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suicide</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Research has shown that more than 90% of people who kill themselves have depression or another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder (Conwell &amp; Brent, 1995). </li>
    <li>Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the 30,000 reported suicides in the U.S. each year (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). </li>
    <li>The suicide rate for older adults is more than 50% higher than the rate for the nation as a whole. Up to two-thirds of older adult suicides are attributed to untreated or misdiagnosed depression (Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disparities</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic persons of other races are more likely to report major depression than non-Hispanic whites, based on responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8), which covers eight of the nine criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) for diagnosis of major depressive disorder (CDC, 2010). </li>
    <li>For individuals who experienced a depressive disorder in the past year, 63.7% of Latinos, 68.7% of Asians, and 58.8% of African Americans, compared with 40.2% of non-Latino whites, did not access any mental health treatment in the past year (Alegr&iacute;a et al., 2008). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Populations: Geriatrics</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>The rate of depression in adults older than 65 years of age ranges from 7% to 36% in medical outpatient clinics and increases to 40% in the hospitalized elderly (Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement [ICSI], 2010). </li>
    <li>Comorbidities are more common in the elderly. The highest rates of depression are found in those with strokes (30% to 60%), coronary artery disease (up to 44%), cancer (up to 40%), Parkinson's disease (40%), and Alzheimer's disease (20% to 40%) (ICSI, 2010). </li>
    <li>Similar to other groups, the elderly with depression are more likely than younger patients to underreport depressive symptoms (ICSI, 2010). </li>
