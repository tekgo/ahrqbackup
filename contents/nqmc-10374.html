Description

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common acute condition that is most commonly treated empirically in the outpatient setting. Interventions to avoid recurrent UTI include antimicrobial prophylaxis, post-coital prophylaxis, and patient-initiated therapy. Patient education and prevention are especially important in patients with diabetes, who are at higher risk of infection, although UTI management and treatment is essentially the same as in patients without diabetes. Simple interventions to increase the frequency of liquid intake in high-risk and at-home programs serving older populations can help reduce the rate of hospitalizations related to UTI (as well as dehydration).</p>
<p>Uncomplicated UTIs for the most part are treated in the outpatient setting; however, this condition may progress to more clinically significant infections, such as pyelonephritis, in vulnerable individuals with inadequate or delayed treatment. When access to outpatient is not available or delayed, patients are more likely to use the emergency department for their clinic care and are more likely to present later in the disease process, increasing their probability for admission.</p>
<p>This measure is an avoidable hospitalization/ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) type indicator. ACSC type indicators are not measures of hospital quality, but rather measures of potentially avoidable hospitalization if appropriate outpatient care, other healthcare services or community services were accessed and obtained (i.e., measures of the health care system broadly defined). These measures are designed to assess population access to timely, high quality outpatient and public health services in a particular geographic area, for the purpose of managing chronic disease or diagnosing acute illnesses before progressing to inpatient treatment. These measures are of most interest to comprehensive health care delivery systems, such as some health maintenance organizations (HMOs), accountable care organizations (ACOs) or public health agencies. ACSC indicators correlate with each other and they may be used in conjunction as an overall examination of outpatient care and access to care at a national, regional or county level.</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Although urinary tract infections (UTI) represent the most common bacterial infection encountered in the ambulatory care setting with over 8.6 visits in 2007 (Foxman, 2002; Sammon et al., 2014), it is estimated that ten percent of hospital admissions for UTI could be avoided by improved ambulatory care access. Of the 1.6 billion dollars spent on UTI in 2007, 55% of expenditures were attributed to inpatient care (Sammon et al., 2014). Eighty-four (84%) percent of these visits were women (of which 23.3% originated in the emergency department [ED]) (Hooton, 2012; Schappert &amp; Rechtsteiner, 2011). A more recent population based study, years 2006 to 2009, reported an average 2.7 million ED visits per year leading to 450,136 admissions (Sammon et al., 2014). Significant predictors for hospital admission include increased age (OR=1.037), pyelonephritis (OR=5.29), and male gender (OR=1.58). Admitted patients are also more likely to have Medicare insurance, be cared for at an urban teaching hospital, and or treated at zip codes with higher median incomes (Sammon et al., 2014). These numbers are much higher than the 1997 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, where researchers reported close to 1 million ED visits for UTI that resulted in 100,000 hospitalizations (McCaig, 1997). Increasing ED utilization for primary care and use of the ED as an admission pathway are thought to be responsible for this dramatic increase in ED visits (Sammon et al., 2014). Other reports suggest an increasing rise of hospitalizations for UTI associated with an aging population, increasing levels of associated patient comorbidities (especially the escalating rate of diabetes and obesity), and growing levels of antimicrobial resistance to oral medications used to treat UTI in the community setting (Sammon et al., 2014). The Urologic Diseases in America project reported a sharp increase in ED visits for UTI in younger women; also contributing the upswing to potential disparities in access to health insurance and or primary care providers (Griebling, 2005). </p>
<p>Many state departments of health track Prevention Quality Indicator (PQI) 12. For example, the California Office of Statewide Health Planning &amp; Development reported a 6.5% decrease in age-sex adjusted rates for PQI 12 between 2007 and 2011 (although unadjusted rates were slightly higher) (California Office of Statewide Health Planning &amp; Development, 2013). A study of Maryland Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries reported that African Americans had slightly higher adjusted UTI admission rates compared to whites. Although this difference was non-significant, the difference was responsible for 142 avoidable hospitalizations in 2006 resulting in an additional $907,330 U.S. dollars (O'Neil et al., 2010). </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Reliability Testing</strong><br />
The developer's metric of reliability is the signal to noise ratio, which is the ratio of the between county (area) variance (signal) to the within county (area) variance (noise). The formula is signal / (signal + noise). There is a county (area)-specific signal to noise ratio, which is used as an empirical Bayes univariate shrinkage estimator. The overall signal to noise ratio is a weighted average of the county (area)-specific signal-to-noise ratio, where the weight is [1 / (signal + noise)^2]. The signal is calculated using an iterative method. The analysis reports the reliability of the risk-adjusted rate (before applying the empirical Bayes univirate shrinkage estimator).</p>
<p>Overall the risk-adjusted rate is highly reliable. Based on a norm of a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.80, 80% of counties (areas) exceed the norm. Reliability is less than the norm in areas with population less than approximately 3,000 persons, meaning that the performance score is reliability adjusted closer to the shrinkage target in those areas. </p>
<p><strong>Validity Testing</strong><br />
The developer conducted construct validity testing to examine the association between the risk-adjusted rate and area structural characteristics potentially associated with quality of care, including prior performance, using regression analysis.</p>
<p>Given the stated rationale, the expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "Less Access to High Quality Outpatient Care" construct validity measure (F1) and the county (area) risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The expectation for the regression analysis given the expected relationship between the "More Market Competition" construct validity measure (F2) and the county (area) risk-adjusted rate is a positive, statistically significant coefficient. The results are consistent with expectations. Also, past performance is a moderate predictor of current performance with a coefficient of 0.78.</p>
