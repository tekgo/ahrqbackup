Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The grades of evidence (<strong>I-III</strong>) and levels of recommendations (<strong>A-C</strong>) are defined at the end of "Major Recommendations."</p>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry used in conjunction with standard fetal surveillance, such as nonstress tests, or biophysical profiles, or both, is associated with improved outcomes in fetuses in which fetal growth restriction has been diagnosed. </li>
    <li>When delivery for fetal growth restriction is anticipated before 34 weeks of gestation, antenatal corticosteroids should be administered before delivery because they are associated with improved preterm neonatal outcomes. </li>
    <li>For cases in which delivery occurs before 32 weeks of gestation, magnesium sulfate should be considered for fetal and neonatal neuroprotection. </li>
    <li>Nutritional and dietary supplemental strategies for the prevention of fetal growth restriction are not effective and are not recommended. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The following recommendations and conclusions are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Fetal growth restriction alone is not an indication for cesarean delivery. </li>
    <li>The optimal timing of delivery of the growth-restricted fetus depends on the underlying etiology of the growth restriction (if known) as well as the estimated gestational age. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Grades of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong> Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong> Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong> Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong> Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong> Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees</p>
<p><strong>Levels of Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level A</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level B</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Level C</strong> &mdash; Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.</p></div>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 1990&ndash;January 2013. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician&ndash;gynecologists were used.</p></div>
