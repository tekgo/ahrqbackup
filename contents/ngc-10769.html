<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Genetic Test Interpretation</span></strong></p>
<p>Each named * allele is defined by the genotype at one or more specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (see Supplementary Table S1 [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The function associated with these allelic variants is summarized in Supplementary Table S2. The assignment of the likely cytochrome P450 (CYP)345 (<em>CYP3A5</em>) phenotype, based on * allele diplotypes, is summarized in Table 1 below. <em>CYP3A5</em> alleles have been extensively studied in groups with diverse geographic ancestries (see Supplementary Table S3). One of the limitations inherent in a genotype-only test is that rare or <em>de novo</em> variants may not be included in commercially available genotyping tests.</p>

<p class="Note"><sup>a</sup>Typically, with other CYP enzymes, an extensive metabolizer would be classified as a "normal" metabolizer, and, therefore, the drug dose would not change based on the patient's genotype. However, in the case of CYP3A5 and tacrolimus, a CYP3A5 expresser (i.e., CYP3A5 extensive metabolizer or intermediate metabolizer) would require a higher recommended starting dose and the CYP3A5 nonexpresser (i.e., poor metabolizer) would require the standard recommended starting dose.</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>b</sup>This recommendation includes the use of tacrolimus in kidney, heart, lung, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, and liver transplant patients in which the donor and recipient genotypes are identical.</p>
<p class="Note"><sup>c</sup>Further dose adjustments or selection of alternative therapy may be necessary because of other clinical factors (e.g., medication interactions, or hepatic function).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therapeutic Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p>This guideline is not intended to recommend for or against <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype testing in transplants. The current evidence for utility of <em>CYP3A5</em> genotyping to guide tacrolimus dosing is limited to <em>CYP3A5's</em> effect on tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters, with no direct evidence for improved clinical immunosuppressant outcome. As a result, the authors are not recommending whether or not to test for the <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype in transplants, but they are providing recommendations on how to use <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype information if it is known. Since it is typical clinical practice to achieve target blood concentrations as quickly as possible, the authors do recommend if <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype is known, to individualize initial tacrolimus treatment using <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype to guide tacrolimus dosing, as outlined in Table 2 above. Transplant recipients with the poor metabolizer phenotype (Table 1 above) should receive the standard dosing of medication based on the tacrolimus package insert. Those recipients with an extensive or intermediate metabolizer phenotype will generally require an increased dose of tacrolimus to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations. The authors recommend a dose 1.5 to 2 times higher than standard dosing, but not to exceed 0.3 mg/kg/day, followed by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), given the risk of arterial vasoconstriction, hypertension, and nephrotoxicity that can occur with supratherapeutic tacrolimus concentrations. In addition, concomitant medications, abnormal liver function, or presence of clinical conditions, such as diarrhea, must be taken into consideration when dosing tacrolimus (see the section "Other Considerations" in the original guideline document".</p>
<p>Given the availability of TDM, genetic testing is most helpful before initiation of the drug in order to more rapidly achieve therapeutic drug concentrations. This was illustrated in a randomized controlled trial in which target tacrolimus blood concentrations were achieved earlier in new kidney transplant recipients whose tacrolimus dose was chosen based on <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype versus a control group that started tacrolimus based on standard weight-based dosing. In this study, patients received induction therapy with either basiliximab or antithymocyte globulin. Extensive metabolizers in the genotyped-dosed group had an increase in tacrolimus dose to 0.3 mg/kg/day, whereas the poor metabolizers had a decrease to 0.15 mg/kg/day, and the control group received 0.2 mg/kg/day. TDM was used in both groups. At three days after starting treatment with tacrolimus, significantly more of the transplant recipients in the genotyping group compared with control recipients had achieved target range (43.2% vs. 29.1%, respectively). However, it should be noted that tacrolimus was not started until day seven while awaiting genotyping test results, which may differ from standard treatments with a start of tacrolimus at the time of transplantation. No differences were seen in patient survival, nephrotoxicity, or acute rejection between the groups over the three-month follow-up. With this study as the only published randomized control trial, more data are needed to understand if dosing tacrolimus by genotype will affect clinical outcomes. However, a recent meta-analysis including 21 studies evaluating the effect of <em>CYP3A5</em> polymorphism on kidney transplant recipients concluded that there is a significantly increased risk for transplant rejection for those with the <em>CYP3A5*1/*1</em> or <em>CYP3A5*1/*3</em> genotype (<em>P</em>=0.04; odds ratio=1.32). Furthermore, patients with the <em>CYP3A5*3/*3</em> (nonexpresser) genotype exhibited dose adjusted trough concentrations 1.8 to 2.5 times higher than <em>CYP3A5</em> expressers during the first year after transplantation.</p>
<p>Thus, at present, there is no definitive evidence to indicate that genotype-guided dosing for tacrolimus affects long-term clinical outcomes. However, there is strong evidence to support its effect on achieving target trough whole blood concentrations, which is routine clinical practice for most centers (see Supplementary Table S4). Besides initial dose, genotype-guided dosing may also be useful in patients in whom achieving therapeutic blood concentrations has been difficult, where the genotype may provide some additional information to discern the reason.</p>
<p>In liver transplant recipients, the <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype of the donor liver may not be the same as the <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype of the recipient intestine. In these cases, it may be necessary to account for both the donor and recipient genotypes when determining the dose. However, studies to date have been inconclusive as to the relative influence of the donor and recipient genotypes, and whether donor liver and recipient intestinal genotypes come into play at different points post-transplant. While some studies show that the donor genotype affects dose-adjusted trough concentrations from the first week post-transplant, others show that it does not begin to play a role until the second week or even the sixth month post-transplant. Evidence is also conflicting for recipient intestinal genotype: a few studies show that it never significantly affects tacrolimus concentrations, whereas others show its influence on concentrations is only significant up to the point at which the donor genotype becomes significant. Because of the small number of studies analyzing these cases, as well as inconsistent results, this guideline recommendation only includes kidney, heart, lung, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, and liver transplant patients in which the donor and recipient genotypes are identical.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pediatrics</span></strong></p>
<p>The effect of <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype on dose-corrected tacrolimus concentration in pediatric populations has been studied in several clinical settings, including heart and liver transplantation, but most extensively following kidney transplantation. Unfortunately, available data vary in terms of study duration following transplant and inclusion of additional factors that impact the dose-exposure relationship. In general, although the dose-exposure relationship changes over time regardless of genotype, dose-corrected tacrolimus trough concentrations are 1.5- to 2-fold higher in kidney transplant patients with <em>CYP3A5*3/*3</em> genotypes compared with patients with <em>CYP3A5*1/*1</em> or <em>*1/*3</em> genotypes over the first two to four weeks post-transplant, at six months, and throughout the first year post-transplant. However, patient age and concurrent drug therapy also contribute to variability in the tacrolimus dose-exposure relationship in children. For example, post-pubertal renal transplant patients (age &gt;12 years) have higher dose-corrected tacrolimus concentrations compared with younger children in the first two to three week posttransplantation period or over the first year post-transplant, indicative of a lower dose requirement to achieve a comparable target concentration. Thus, for children and adolescents with at least one <em>CYP3A5*1</em> allele, a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in dose followed by TDM as recommended for adults seems appropriate.</p>

<p>The authors searched the PubMed database (1966 to January 2015) and Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to January 2015) using several keyword strategies: tacrolimus AND CYP3A5 OR tacrolimus AND CYP3A4. Literature evidence for this guideline was annotated, organized, and assessed using Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Web tools (<a href="https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/guideline-for-tacrolimus-and-cyp3a5/" title="CPIC Web site">CPIC Web site</a>). All papers used as literature evidence for this guideline can be found on the <a href="https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/guideline-for-tacrolimus-and-cyp3a5/" title="CPIC Web site">CPIC Web site</a>. </p>
<p>Using the specified search criteria, 201 publications were identified after excluding non-English manuscripts or review articles. Inclusion criteria included publications discussing <em>in vivo</em> clinical outcome (e.g., nephrotoxicity, transplant rejection) for tacrolimus in individuals who vary by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A5 (<em>CYP3A5</em>) rs776746 genotype/phenotype and <em>in vivo</em> or <em>in vitro</em> pharmacokinetic data (e.g., dose-adjusted trough concentrations, clearance) for tacrolimus in individuals who vary by <em>CYP3A5</em> rs776746 genotype/phenotype.</p>
<p>To construct a <em>CYP3A5*1, *3, *6</em> and <em>*7</em> allele frequency table based on ethnicity, the PubMed database (1966 to July 2014) was searched using the criteria <em>CYP3A5</em> allele frequency AND CYP3A5 polymorphism frequency with filter limits set to retrieve "English" literature. Studies from the literature review were also used to construct the frequency table. Studies were considered for inclusion if (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated; (2) only one ethnicity was analyzed, or in cases where multiple ethnicities were studied, allele frequencies were given for each ethnicity separately; (3) either allele frequencies or alleles for <em>CYP3A5*1, *3, *6,</em> or<em>*7</em> genotypes were reported; (4) the method by which <em>CYP3A5</em> was genotyped was reliable; (5) the sample size was at least 15 subjects; and (6) the study represented publication of novel data (no reviews or meta-analyses). The combined analysis included 5,285 Africans, 8,226 Asians, 5,954 Caucasians, 2,144 Latin Americans, 1,401 Middle Easterners and 1,411 Southwest Asians.</p></div>

<h2>Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Benefits
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Tacrolimus dosing is routinely directed by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Yet, for patients who have an existing cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A5 (<em>CYP3A5</em>) genotyping result, <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype-guided dosing can achieve initial target tacrolimus concentrations more quickly after transplantation even when TDM-based titration is used. Faster achievement of target concentrations could potentially reduce the risk of graft rejection because of underexposure and toxicity because of overexposure. However, prospective clinical trials are needed to assess if <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype-guided dosing improves these outcomes.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Tacrolimus in clinical use is complicated by its high between-patient variability in pharmacokinetics as well as its narrow therapeutic index. This may lead to underexposure, potentially increasing the risk of rejection, or overexposure, with risk of toxicity, including nephrotoxicity, hypertension, neurotoxicity, and hyperglycemia. </li>
    <li>Although therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is helpful for adjusting subsequent doses based on blood concentrations, it provides no information for the initial dose. Individual differences in first pass metabolism may delay reaching target blood concentrations with the initial selected dose. Furthermore, although achieving target blood concentrations does not always ensure efficacy or diminish adverse events, target blood concentrations specific for organ type and time post-transplant are available in the package insert and established by consensus guidelines. </li>
    <li>Several drugs (drug-drug interactions) are important to consider, especially nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and azole antifungals that are commonly coadministered in the transplant population. The drug interaction with the azole antifungals has been reported to be less profound in cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A5 (<em>CYP3A5</em>) expressers. For additional information on tacrolimus drug interactions, see the review by van Gelder (2002). Specific patient factors, such as fasting or diarrhea, may cause altered absorption that can affect tacrolimus concentrations. This has been extensively reviewed in an article by Staatz et al(2004). </li>
    <li>Additional genetic variants described in the literature but with unclear effects on tacrolimus metabolism due to either limited or conflicting studies include <em>CYP3A4*22</em>, <em>POR*28</em>, <em>PPAR alph</em>a, and<em> ABCB1</em>. A critical issue in predicting tacrolimus clearance <em>&nbsp;</em>is the relative contribution of <em>CYP3A4</em> compared to <em>CYP3A5</em> to its metabolism. Because of the complete loss of metabolic activity with the <em>CYP3A5*3</em> allele, the impact of variation in <em>CYP3A4</em> may be high in those with no <em>CYP3A5</em> expression. Of note, donor <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype may play a role in pharmacodynamics. In kidney transplant recipients, the <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype together with the donor <em>ABCB1</em> genotype may affect the susceptibility of the kidney for tacrolimus nephrotoxicity. While the current guideline refers to using the recipient <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype to guide selection of the optimal initial dose for tacrolimus, one can expect the potential for greater predictive value in polygenic algorithms. A further confounding factor is the influence of ethnicity. Although it was initially hypothesized that individuals of African origin require high doses of tacrolimus because of expression of <em>CYP3A5</em>, these individuals have a high dose requirement for tacrolimus, irrespective of <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype. This finding suggests other factors besides <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype are important in individuals of sub-Saharan African descent. </li>
    <li><em>CYP3A5</em> genotyping cannot replace therapeutic drug monitoring, as other factors (i.e., demographic factors, drug&ndash;drug interactions, and genetic variation affecting tacrolimus pharmacodynamics) also influence tacrolimus dose requirements. As with any genetic test, a possible risk is the misreporting or misinterpretation of genotype test results. An error in genotyping could result in an increase in tacrolimus dose and subsequently overexposure. However, anticipated effects are limited because of stringent TDM. </li>

<p>Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and peer-reviewed literature available at the time they are written, and are intended only to assist clinicians in decision-making, as well as to identify questions for further research. New evidence may have emerged since the time a guideline was submitted for publication. Guidelines are limited in scope and are not applicable to interventions or diseases not specifically identified. Guidelines do not account for all individual variations among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It remains the responsibility of the health care provider to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Adherence to any guideline is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be solely made by the clinician and the patient. CPIC assumes no responsibility for any injury to persons or damage to property related to any use of CPIC's guidelines, or for any errors or omissions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests</strong></span></p>
<p>Dose alterations based on cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A5 (<em>CYP3A5</em>) genotype may result in faster achievement of target tacrolimus concentrations with fewer dose adjustments. In addition, several clinical caveats apply: (1) clinical factors (e.g., age, concomitant drugs) affect tacrolimus concentrations; (2) variants in genes other than <em>CYP3A5</em> may affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and therefore overall exposure; (3) the relationship between tacrolimus concentration and efficacy and toxicity varies among individuals (pharmacodynamic variability); (4) the genetic determinants of tacrolimus efficacy and toxicity (pharmacodynamics) are not defined; (5) altering initial tacrolimus dosing based on <em>CYP3A5</em> genotype has not been shown to improve efficacy or reduce toxicity; and (6) monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentration remains indicated during treatment. With the expansion of the knowledge base, further refinement of the genotype-based dosing recommendations may be required.</p></div>
