<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of visits for patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease where patients (or caregiver[s], as appropriate) were queried about Parkinson's disease medication-related motor complications (e.g., wearing off, dyskinesia, or off-time).</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Dopaminergic therapies are commonly accompanied by motor fluctuations, including off time (periods of return of Parkinson's disease [PD] symptoms when medication effect wears off) and dyskinesia (drug-induced involuntary movements, including chorea and dystonia) in most patients. It is important to query patients about these problems because medication adjustments and the addition of adjunctive medications can often ameliorate the problem(s). With these adjustments, the patient's quality of life can be improved.*</p>
<p class="Note">*The following clinical recommendation statements are quoted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</span> from the referenced clinical guidelines and represent the evidence base for the measure:</p>
<p class="Note">Monoamine oxidase isoenzyme type B (MAO-B) inhibitors may be used to reduce motor fluctuations in people with later PD. (Level A) (NICE GL35, Jun 2006)</p>
<p class="Note">Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors may be used to reduce motor fluctuations in people with later PD. (Level B) (NICE GL35, Jun 2006)</p>
<p class="Note">Modified-release levodopa preparations may be used to reduce motor complications in people with later PD, but should not drugs of first choice. (Level A) (NICE GL35, Jun 2006)</p>
<p class="Note">Dopamine agonists may be used to reduce motor fluctuations in people with later PD. (Level A) (NICE GL35, Jun 2006)</p>
<p class="Note">Wearing-Off</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" class="Note">
    <li>Adjust levodopa dosing. In an early phase, when motor fluctuations are just becoming apparent, adjustments in the frequency of levodopa dosing during the day, tending to achieve four to six daily doses, might attenuate the wearing-off. (Good Practice Point) (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
    <li>Switch from standard levodopa to controlled release (CR) formulation. CR formulations of levodopa can also improve wearing-off. (Level C) (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
    <li>Add COMT inhibitors or MAO-B inhibitors. No recommendations can be made on which treatment should be chosen first - on average, all reduce OFF time by about 1 to 1.5 h/day. The only published direct comparison (Level A) showed no difference between entacapone and rasagiline. (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
    <li>Add dopamine agonists. Oral dopamine agonists are efficacious in reducing OFF time in patients experiencing wearing-off. Currently, no dopamine agonist has proven better than another, but switching from one agonist to another can be helpful in some patients. (Level B/C) (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
    <li>Add amantadine or an anticholinergic. In patients with disabling recurrent OFF symptoms that fail to improve further with the above mentioned strategies, the addition of an anticholinergic (in younger patients), or amantadine, may improve symptoms in some cases. (Good Practice Point) (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
</ul>
<p class="Note">Peak-Dose Dyskinesia</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;" class="Note">
    <li>Add amantadine - most studies use 200 to 400 mg/day. The benefit may last &lt;8 months. (Level A) (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
    <li>Reduce individual levodopa dose size, at the risk of increasing OFF time. The latter can be compensated for by increasing the number of daily doses of levodopa or increasing the doses of a dopamine agonist. (Level C) (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
    <li>Discontinue or reduce dose of MAO-B inhibitors or COMT inhibitors at the risk of worsening wearing-off. (GPP) (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
    <li>Add atypical antipsychotics, clozapine with doses ranging between 12.5 and 75 mg/day up to 200 mg/day. (Level A) (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
    <li>Add quetiapine. (Level C) (EFNS PD Part II, Nov 2006) </li>
    <li>Amantadine may be considered to reduce dyskinesia. (Level C) (AAN QSS PD Dyskin, Apr 2006) </li>
    <li>Entacapone and rasagiline should be offered to reduce off time. (Level A) (AAN QSS PD Dyskin, Apr 2006) </li>
    <li>Pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, and tolcapone should be considered to reduce off time. (Level B) (AANQSS PD Dyskin, Apr 2006) </li>
    <li>Apomorphine, cabergoline, and selegiline may be considered to reduce off time. (Level C) (AAN QSS PD Dyskin, Apr 2006) </li>
    <li>The available evidence does not establish superiority of one medicine over another in reducing off time. (Level B) (AAN QSS PD Dyskin, Apr 2006) </li>
</ul></div>
