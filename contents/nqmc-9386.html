<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a bacterium which commonly infects pregnant women and poses the risk of being transmitted to infants during the perinatal period (Phares et al., 2008). GBS transmission from mother to infant carries serious health risks to the newborn including sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis (Baker &amp; Edwards, 1995; Davies et al., 2001; Verani et al., 2010). In both Canada and the United States, GBS disease is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality (Verani et al., 2010; Darling &amp; Saurette, 2010; Money et al., 2004). </p>
<p>In Canada, almost one-fifth of pregnant women are colonized with GBS at 36 weeks' gestation (Darling &amp; Saurette, 2010). If left untreated, approximately 50% of babies born to GBS positive mothers become colonized and 1% to 2% of colonized infants develop GBS disease (Darling &amp; Saurette, 2010). Infections occurring within the first week of an infant's life are considered early-onset GBS and are acquired through vertical transmission from a GBS colonized mother to the infant. Infections occurring after the first week of life are considered late-onset and can be acquired through both vertical transmission from the mother to the infant and horizontal transmission from the hospital or community to the infant (Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care [CTFPHC], 2002).</p>
<p>When maternal GBS infections are identified prenatally, early-onset GBS disease in the newborn can be prevented by administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to the mother (CTFPHC, 2002; Verani et al., 2010). The screening method that identifies the greatest number of GBS infected mothers should, therefore, result in the fewest number of infants with early-onset GBS disease. In 1996, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued recommendations for two screening strategies to prevent perinatal GBS transmission: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Universal screening</span>: All pregnant women are screened for GBS infection by culture testing at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation and decisions to administer IAP are based on a positive GBS culture. </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk-based screening</span>: IAP is administered based on risk factors that increase likelihood of early-onset GBS infection (e.g., previous delivery of GBS-infected baby, premature delivery, maternal fever greater than 38&ordm;C, rupture of membranes greater than 18 hours [Verani et al., 2010]). </li>
</ul>
<p>A large population-based study conducted in the late 90s found that universal screening identified a greater proportion of women at risk of transmitting GBS to their babies than risk-based screening. Based on this study, CDC's 2002 revised guidelines recommended universal screening exclusively (Verani et al., 2010). Despite these recommendations, the issue of whether to employ a universal vs. risk-based approach to screening remains contentious. While universal screening is recommended in the United States, Canada, and Belgium, it is not currently recommended in the United Kingdom or New Zealand (Colbourn et al., 2007; CTFPHC, 2002; Melin et al., 2004; Campbell et al., 2004). Concerns remain about clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, overuse of antibiotics, and medicalization of labour (Gilbert, 2004; Cromwell et al., 2007).</p></div>

Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Group B streptococcus (GBS) disease is a leading cause of infant mortality in Canada. Screening pregnant women for GBS colonization has been shown to greatly reduce early-onset GBS disease in infants. Screening can be done by universal culture testing or by assessing maternal risk factors. </li>
    <li>Universal, culture-based GBS screening of women at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation is recommended as best practice by a range of North American bodies, including the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, Society of Obstetrician and Gynaecologists of Canada, Association of Ontario Midwives, British Columbia Reproductive Care Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Nurse-Midwives, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Society for Microbiology. </li>
    <li>In contrast, risk-based GBS screening is recommended by several non-North American agencies including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, New Zealand GBS Consensus Working Party, and New Zealand College of Midwives. </li>
    <li>According to a 2007 health technology assessment, until a GBS vaccine is developed, universal, culture-based GBS screening followed by intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS positive women is considered to be the most cost effective strategy for women at low risk of GBS infection (i.e., membrane rupture greater than 18 hours or no risk factors). </li>
    <li>While many guidelines have made recommendations on GBS screening, there is a dearth of scientific evidence on this subject (e.g., randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews). As of 2010, there were no randomized controlled trials comparing the two strategies. </li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <em>What is Known About Universal versus Risk-based Maternal Screening to Prevent Group B Streptococcal Infection in Newborns?</em> for a summary of the evidence on the recommended prenatal screening strategy for group B streptococcal infection. The report's intention is to support efforts that seek to increase rates of universal GBS screening among pregnant women across Ontario.</p>

<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>To validate the seven potential indicators as being appropriate for use throughout the province, the authors first extracted data from the BORN Information System (BIS) for fiscal year 2009 to 2010 to assess historical and current performance on these indicators across Ontario's 14 health regions (Local Health Integration Networks). Simultaneously, evidence summaries on each of the potential indicators were developed in collaboration with the Knowledge to Action Research Centre at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (Thielman et al., 2011; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What are the drivers," 2010; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What are the maternal," 2011; Konnyu, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, "What is known," 2011; Khangura, Grimshaw, &amp; Moher, 2010). This group, which has expertise in the review and synthesis of literature to support evidence-informed health care decision-making, assisted with determining the level of scientific evidence to support each indicator. For example, the evidence summary on early term repeat Caesarean section (i.e., before 39 weeks' gestation) in a defined population determined that as a result of this practice there were indeed objective risks to babies that could be reduced by delaying delivery.</p>
<p>Following review of the data and evidence summaries, the committee removed one indicator and refined some of the others, leaving six. In five of the six, the potential for improvement in rates was obvious. The remaining indicator (rate of screening for group B streptococcus) is currently satisfactory throughout all health regions of the province; however, the committee felt it was important at the outset to have the dashboard reflect not only performance areas requiring improvement, but also areas in which performance was good.</p></div>
