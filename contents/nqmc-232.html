<h3>
Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure assesses quality in terms of comfort using the General Comfort Questionnaire. The questionnaire, given to either patients or family members, measures the extent to which the responder is experiencing comfort at that point in time.</p></div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul>
<li>Patients and families want and often need to be comforted in stressful health care situations. 
<li>It is important to assess aspects of care that patients and families care about. 
<li>Comfort is congruent with precepts of complementary therapies and holistic interventions, such as massage, music and art therapy, 
or spiritual interventions. 
<li>The outcome of comfort is of multidisciplinary concern and provides a common and positive goal for health care teams to meet.
<li>The outcome of patient and family comfort is entailed in standards of care for many settings, including hospice, palliative care, and long-term care (LTC). It is important to determine if these standards of care are met, from the patients' and families' perspective. 
<li>Enhanced comfort signifies improvement above a previous baseline in which comfort <em>needs</em> were predominate. If associated with 
specific interventions (comfort measures) provided by health care personnel, the improved state indicates that interventions were effective. 
<li>When comfort is increased, patients and families are better able to engage in health seeking behaviors. 
<li>As a positive outcome of care, patient and/or family comfort speaks to benefits of care, not merely a decrease or absence of negative outcomes such as nosocomial infections, diminished mobility or function, prolonged length of stay (LOS), or mortality. As such, measures of patient and/or family comfort are positive indicators of quality of care, not just absence of quality.</li></ul>

<h2>Evaluation of Measure Properties
</h2>
<div class='field field_text'>
<h3>
Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence for face validity exists because patient representatives from each population of interest agreed that the items were relevant to their comfort experiences in each setting, and panels of experts also spoke to the representativeness of the questionnaires.</p>

<p>Concurrent validity is more difficult to assess, because the author is the only person who has developed questionnaires to measure patient and family comfort. Low positive correlations exist between comfort questionnaires and visual analog scales for total comfort and for Relief, Ease, and Transcendence. The visual analog scale for Total Comfort is not sensitive to changes in patient comfort over time.</p>

<p> Adequate construct validity exists because the instruments show statistically significant sensitivity in expected directions. For example, respondents in the community have higher comfort that those in hospital settings and comfort is a strong predictor of success of interventions for urinary incontinence.</p></div>
