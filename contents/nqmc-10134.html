<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Each year about 700,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke, which is the nation's third leading cause of death. Approximately two thirds of these individuals survive and require rehabilitation. Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States, with about 4.4 million stroke survivors alive today. Forty percent of stroke patients are left with moderate functional impairment and 15 to 30 percent with severe disability. More than 60 percent of those who have experienced stroke, serious injury, or a disabling disease have never received rehabilitation. Stroke rehabilitation should begin as soon as the diagnosis of stroke is established and life-threatening problems are under control. Among the high priorities for stroke are to mobilize the patient and encourage resumption of self-care activities as soon as possible. A considerable body of evidence indicates better clinical outcomes when patients with stroke are treated in a setting that provides coordinated, multidisciplinary stroke-related evaluation and services. Effective rehabilitation interventions initiated early following stroke can enhance the recovery process and minimize functional disability. The primary goal of rehabilitation is to prevent complications, minimize impairments, and maximize function.</p></div>

<h3>
Additional Information Supporting Need for the Measure
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Stroke ranks as the number five cause of death in the United States, following diseases of the heart, cancer, and chronic lung-related diseases. Each year, approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke. Approximately 610,000 of these are first attacks, and 185,000 are recurrent strokes. These numbers equate to one stroke victim every 40 seconds on average. According to 2010 mortality data, one of every 20 deaths in the United States is attributable to stroke. Women have a higher lifetime risk of stroke than men. Lifetime risk of stroke among those 55 to75 years of age was 1 in 5 for women (20% to 21%) and approximately 1 in 6 for men (14% to 17%). Blacks have a risk of first-ever stroke that is almost twice that of whites (American Heart Association [AHA], 2015). </li>
    <li>Stroke is also a leading cause of long-term disability (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009). Data from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) revealed that 50% of ischemic stroke survivors age greater than 65 years had some hemiparesis; 35% experienced depressive symptoms; 30% were unable to ambulate without assistance; 26% were dependent in activities of daily living; 19% had aphasia; and 26% were institutionalized in a nursing home. The mean lifetime cost of ischemic stroke, including inpatient care, rehabilitation, and follow-up as necessary for residual deficits are estimated at $140,048 per person (AHA, 2015). </li>
    <li>The evidence indicates that patients do better with a well-organized, multidisciplinary approach to post-acute rehabilitation after stroke. The rehabilitation team may consist of a physician, nurse, physical therapist, occupational therapist, kinesiotherapist, speech and language pathologist, psychologist, recreational therapist, patient, and family members/caregivers. If an organized rehabilitation team is not available in the facility, the evidence indicates that patients with moderate or severe symptoms should be offered a referral to a facility with such a service. </li>
    <li>Stroke rehabilitation should begin during the acute hospitalization, as soon as the diagnosis of stroke is established and life-threatening problems are controlled. The highest priorities of early stroke rehabilitation are to prevent recurrence of stroke, manage comorbidities, and prevent complications related to immobility, dysphagia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Rehabilitation services may include: dysphagia treatment and management; speech therapy for communication disorders (i.e., aphasia and dysarthria) and related cognitive impairments; lower-extremity strengthening and gait training; positioning, passive stretching, range-of-motion exercises, and pharmacotherapy for patients with paretic limbs and muscle spasticity; corrective measures (e.g., splinting, serial casting, surgery) for contractures; treatment interventions for post-stroke shoulder pain; treatment for depression and other cognitive and emotional disorders; and, other services. </li>
    <li>Living with disabilities after a stroke is a lifelong challenge during which people continue to seek and find ways to compensate for or adapt to persisting neurological deficits. For many, the real work of recovery begins after formal rehabilitation when the patient attempts to use newly learned skills without the support of the rehabilitation environment or team (Bates et al., 2005). </li>
</ul>
