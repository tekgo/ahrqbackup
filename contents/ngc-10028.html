Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The strength of the evidence (<strong>high, moderate, low,</strong> or <strong>insufficient evidence to determine benefits or risks</strong>) and strength of recommendations (<strong>strong, weak</strong>) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 1</strong>: <em>The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that all overweight and obese patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) should be encouraged to lose weight.</em> (<strong>Grade: strong recommendation; low-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>Obesity is a risk factor for OSA, and evidence showed that intensive weight-loss interventions help reduce Apnea&ndash;Hypopnea Index (AHI) scores and improve OSA symptoms. Weight loss is also associated with many other health benefits other than for OSA. Other factors, such as alcohol and opioid use, may be associated with adverse outcomes in patients with sleep apnea, but these factors were not addressed in the evidence review.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2</strong>: <em>ACP recommends continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment as initial therapy for patients diagnosed with OSA.</em> (<strong>Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>In patients with excessive daytime sleepiness who have been diagnosed with OSA, CPAP is the most extensively studied therapy. This treatment has been shown to improve Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, reduce AHI and arousal index scores, and increase oxygen saturation. However, CPAP has not been shown to increase quality of life. Evidence on the effect of CPAP on cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes was insufficient. Studies have evaluated various alternative CPAP modifications. Fixed and auto-CPAP, as well as C-Flex, have similar adherence and efficacy. Data were insufficient to determine the comparative efficacy of other CPAP modifications. Greater AHI and ESS scores were generally associated with better adherence to CPAP.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3</strong>: <em>ACP recommends mandibular advancement devices (MADs) as an alternative therapy to CPAP treatment for patients diagnosed with OSA who prefer MADs or for those with adverse effects associated with CPAP treatment.</em> (<strong>Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence</strong>)</p>
<p>Evidence showed that MADs have been used as an alternative to CPAP for treatment of OSA. Patients had AHI scores between 18 and 40 events per hour. Evidence to suggest which patients would benefit most from MADs was insufficient. However, MADs can be considered in patients with adverse effects or for those who do not tolerate or adhere to CPAP.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center conducted the systematic evidence review. The literature search included studies identified using MEDLINE (1966 to September 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and included peer-reviewed studies on adult human patients published in English. Further details about the methods and inclusion and exclusion criteria applied in the evidence review are available in the full Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). No randomized, controlled trial (RCT) on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment with regard to mortality outcomes was identified.</p>
<p>The American College of Physicians (ACP) supplemented the AHRQ review (MEDLINE search, 1946 to October 2012) to identify English-language observational studies in humans reporting death or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular illness associated with OSA treatment strategies (that is, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], surgery, or mandibular advancement devices [MADs]), as well as more recent relevant RCTs.</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>To guide the recommendations, outcomes were prioritized on the basis of clinical importance, starting with death and including cardiovascular outcomes.

<p>The Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center conducted the systematic evidence review. Evidence on the comparative effectiveness of OSA treatments is summarized in the Appendix Table in the original guideline document.

<div class="content_para"><p>This guideline is based on a systematic evidence review sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) that addressed the following key questions related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) management:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">

Potential Harms

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence on adverse effects related to various management strategies for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was sparse, especially from randomized control trials (RCTs). The Appendix Table in the original guideline document summarizes adverse effects associated with each treatment. Tooth loosening, dental crown damage, and temporomandibular joint pain were the most commonly reported adverse effects with mandibular advancement devices (MADs); however, long-term consequences were not reported. Overall, approximately 5% to 15% of patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reported adverse effects that they considered to be substantial, but these symptoms were potentially transient. In general, adverse effects in patients treated with CPAP could be alleviated with termination or modification of the treatment. No long-term adverse effects were reported for weight-loss interventions.</p></div>
