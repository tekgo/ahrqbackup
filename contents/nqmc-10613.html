Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure summarizes the utilization of the following frequently performed procedures that often show wide regional variation and have generated concern regarding potentially inappropriate utilization:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Tonsillectomy </li>
    <li>Bariatric weight loss surgery </li>
    <li>Hysterectomy </li>
    <li>Cholecystectomy </li>
    <li>Back surgery </li>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure lists several frequently performed procedures (mostly surgical) that contribute substantially to overall cost. Wide variations among geographic regions in medical procedure rates appear to have little correlation with health outcomes. The reasons for this are unclear. Some variation is because of unnecessary procedures; conversely, some procedures may not be performed often enough. These rates are likely to be strongly influenced by how the organization manages care.</p>
<p>Variation in procedure rates presents a starting point in examining the kind of care that is being rendered to members. Coding practices, epidemiology, demographics and practice patterns may be responsible for variation. Examining these measures may help eliminate unwarranted variation in the delivery of medical care.</p></div>
