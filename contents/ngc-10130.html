Major Recommendations
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) supports an evaluation prior to participating in high school and collegiate sports using a standardized history and physical (H&amp;P) (i.e., using standardized items as developed by the American Heart Association [AHA] to ensure uniformity and consistency in risk factor assessment [see the table below]). ACPM recommends against routine screening for potential sudden cardiac death (SCD) with electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, and genetic testing in individuals without personal risk factors. The recommendations by ACPM address only mass screening approaches to detecting SCD and are not targeted toward individuals who may be identified by their healthcare provider as "above average" risk who may benefit from additional testing with the modalities mentioned above. ACPM supports the adoption of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Working Group research agenda to evaluate the effectiveness of any screening program in reducing SCD, its cost&ndash;benefit ratio, and its impact on health outcomes (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).</p>

Cost Analysis
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>A limited number of studies suggest that combining history and physical (H&amp;P) and electrocardiogram (ECG) screening for sudden cardiac death (SCD) may be cost effective. An Italian cost-effectiveness analysis of 33,735 athletes, using a more conservative approach (10% of affected athletes would live an additional 20 years), estimated the cost per year of life saved at approximately $20,000 for the Italian model (H&amp;P and ECG) and about $53,350 for the U.S. model (H&amp;P alone). </li>
    <li>The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates the cost of mass ECG screening, followed by echocardiogram and other indicated testing, to be $2.0 billion for 10 million middle and high school athletes. Pending further prospective studies involving U.S. participants, the cost effectiveness of routinely combining H&amp;P and ECG in cardiovascular pre-participation screening in students cannot be conclusively determined. </li>

<h3>
Potential Harms
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Although a history and physical (H&amp;P) costs less, requires minimal resources, and is efficient to administer, it has low sensitivity in detecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other asymptomatic cardiac diseases. Another limitation is the poor utilization of a standardized H&amp;P for pre-participation sports evaluation.</p></div>

<h3>
Qualifying Statements
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) acknowledges that studies addressing the efficacy of screening with clinical outcomes are lacking and that the utility of specific screening modalities remains unclear. However, at the present time, the history and physical (H&amp;P) is the most widely used modality for pre-participation evaluation despite its limited sensitivity in detecting certain cardiac conditions. Promoting an H&amp;P using standardized items as that developed by the American Heart Association (AHA) will ensure uniformity and consistency in risk factor assessment (see the table in the "Major Recommendations" field).</p></div>
