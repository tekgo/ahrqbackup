<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary Statements and Recommendations</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary Statements</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>As women are postponing child-bearing, more of them are experiencing cancer in pregnancy. <strong>(II-2)</strong> </li>
    <li>Chemotherapeutic agents used to combat cancer cross the placenta and may adversely affect embryogenesis by affecting cell division. <strong>(II-1)</strong> </li>
    <li>Exposure to such agents after the first trimester of pregnancy has not been associated with increased risk of malformations but is associated with increased risk of stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal toxicities. <strong>(II-2)</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
    <li>The health care provider should examine the patient's risk of pregnancy and desire to prevent pregnancy during chemotherapy. <strong>(I-A)</strong> </li>
    <li>Decisions about the best course of management in pregnancy, including timing of delivery, should balance maternal and fetal risks. Most authorities concur that maternal health and well-being must prevail. <strong>(I-A)</strong> </li>
    <li>Women diagnosed with cancer in pregnancy should be optimally managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes oncologists and/or hematologists (depending on the malignancy), perinatologists, family physicians, psychologists, social workers, and spiritual advisors, if sought by the family. <strong>(I-A)</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions</span></strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Evidence Assessment*</strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>: Evidence obtained from at least one properly randomized controlled trial</p>
<p><strong>II-1</strong>: Evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization</p>
<p><strong>II-2</strong>: Evidence from well&ndash;designed cohort (prospective or retrospective) or case&ndash;control studies, preferably from more than one centre or research group</p>
<p><strong>II-3</strong>: Evidence obtained from comparisons between times or places with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the results of treatment with penicillin in the 1940s) could also be included in this category.</p>
<p><strong>III</strong>: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees</p>
<p class="Note">*Adapted from The Evaluation of Evidence criteria described in the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.</p>
<p><strong>Classification of Recommendations&dagger;</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> There is good evidence to recommend the clinical preventive action.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> There is fair evidence to recommend the clinical preventive action.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The existing evidence is conflicting and does not allow to make a recommendation for or against use of the clinical preventive action; however, other factors may influence decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> There is fair evidence to recommend against the clinical preventive action.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> There is good evidence to recommend against the clinical preventive action.</p>

Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed or Medline, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library in 2011, using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., antineoplastic agents, neoplasms, pregnancy) and key words (e.g., cancer, neoplasms, pregnancy, chemotherapy, antineoplastic agents). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. Studies were restricted to those with available English abstracts or text. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to October 2011. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and from national and international medical specialty societies.</p></div>
