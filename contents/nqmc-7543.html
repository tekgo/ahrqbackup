Description
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>This measure is used to assess the percentage of adult patients, 19 years and older, who are up-to-date with the following immunizations: one tetanus, diphtheria toxoids vaccine (Td) in the last 10 years, two doses of varicella or history of disease up to year 1995, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for patients 65 years and older, one influenza within the last year, and herpes zoster/shingles for patients 60 years and older. </p></div>

<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The priority aim addressed by this measure is to increase the percentage of patients who are up-to-date with recommended immunizations.</p>
<p>Vaccines are one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century. Before vaccines became widely used, infectious diseases killed thousands of children and adults each year in the United States.</p>
<p>For most Americans today, vaccines are a routine part of health care, yet pockets of vaccine-preventable diseases occur. This is partly related to a growing number of parents who are concerned that vaccines may be the cause of conditions such as autism or question whether vaccines are still necessary. These concerns have caused some parents to delay vaccines or withhold them altogether from their children.</p>
<p>To combat these threats, health care providers need to continue to encourage patients and parents to receive all recommended immunizations and to follow the scientifically based immunization schedules.</p></div>
