<div class="content_para"><p><strong><em>Note from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)</em></strong>: This guidance will be updated as new evidence becomes available. Please check the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/USMEC.htm" title="CDC Web site" target="_blank">CDC's Division of Reproductive Health Web site</a> for any changes that have been made to the recommendations since this guideline was published.</p>
<p>This document updates CDC's <em>U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2010</em> (U.S. MEC 2010), based on new evidence and input from experts. A summary of changes from U.S. MEC 2010 is provided in Appendix A of the original guideline document.</p>
<p>Notable updates include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Addition of recommendations for women with cystic fibrosis, women with multiple sclerosis, and women receiving certain psychotropic drugs or St. John's wort </li>
    <li>Revisions to the recommendations for emergency contraception, including the addition of ulipristal acetate </li>
    <li>Revisions to the recommendations for postpartum women; women who are breastfeeding; women with known dyslipidemias, migraine headaches, superficial venous disease, gestational trophoblastic disease, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); and women who are receiving antiretroviral therapy </li>
    <li><strong>September 2017 Update</strong>: The CDC recently evaluated the evidence and the updated World Health Organization (WHO) guideline on the risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition among women using hormonal contraception (<a href="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/family_planning/MEC-5/en" title="WHO Web site">http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/family_planning/MEC-5/en</a>). After careful review, CDC adopted the updated WHO guidance for inclusion in the U.S MEC guidance; this guidance states that the advantages of progestin-only injectable contraceptive use (including depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA] by women at high risk for HIV infection outweigh the theoretical or proven risks (U.S. MEC category 2). See "Update to CDC's U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2016: Revised Recommendations for the Use of Hormonal contraception Among Women at High Risk for HIV Infection" and "An Updated Systematic Review of Epidemiological evidence on Hormonal Contraceptive Methods and HIV Acquisition in Women" (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Use This Document</span></strong></p>
<p>These recommendations are intended to help health care providers determine the safe use of contraceptive methods among women and men with various characteristics and medical conditions. Providers also can use the information in these recommendations when consulting with women, men, and couples about their selection of contraceptive methods. The tables in this document include recommendations for the use of contraceptive methods by women and men with particular characteristics or medical conditions. Each condition is defined as representing either an individual's characteristics (e.g., age or history of pregnancy) or a known preexisting medical or pathologic condition (e.g., diabetes or hypertension). The recommendations refer to contraceptive methods being used for contraceptive purposes; the recommendations do not consider the use of contraceptive methods for treatment of medical conditions because the eligibility criteria in these situations might differ. The conditions affecting eligibility for the use of each contraceptive method are classified into one of four categories (refer to Box 1 below).</p>
<p><strong>Box 1. Categories of Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use</strong></p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" summary="Table: Box 1. Categories of Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">1 = A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the contraceptive method.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">2 = A condition for which the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">3 = A condition for which the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top">4 = A condition that represents an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using the Categories in Practice</span></strong></p>
<p>Health care providers can use the eligibility categories when assessing the safety of contraceptive method use for women and men with specific medical conditions or characteristics. Category 1 comprises conditions for which no restrictions exist for use of the contraceptive method. Classification of a method/condition as category 2 indicates the method generally can be used, although careful follow-up might be required. For a method/condition classified as category 3, use of that method usually is not recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or acceptable. The severity of the condition and the availability, practicality, and acceptability of alternative methods should be considered, and careful follow-up is required. Hence, provision of a contraceptive method to a woman with a condition classified as category 3 requires careful clinical judgement and access to clinical services. Category 4 comprises conditions that represent an unacceptable health risk if the method is used. For example, a smoker aged &lt;35 years generally can use combined oral contraceptives (COCs) (category 2). However, for a woman aged &ge;35 years who smokes &lt;15 cigarettes per day, the use of COCs usually is not recommended unless other methods are not available or acceptable to her (category 3). A woman aged &ge;35 years who smokes &ge;15 cigarettes per day should not use COCs because of unacceptable health risks, primarily the risk for myocardial infarction and stroke (category 4). The programmatic implications of these categories might depend on the circumstances of particular professional or service organizations. For example, in some settings, a category 3 might mean that a special consultation is warranted.</p>
<p>The recommendations address medical eligibility criteria for the initiation and continued use of all methods evaluated. The issue of continuation criteria is clinically relevant whenever a medical condition develops or worsens during use of a contraceptive method. When the categories differ for initiation and continuation, these differences are noted in the Initiation and Continuation columns. When initiation and continuation are not indicated, the category is the same for initiation and continuation of use.</p>
<p>On the basis of this classification system, the eligibility criteria or initiating and continuing use of a specific contraceptive method are presented in tables (see Appendices A&ndash;K in the original guideline document). In these tables, the first column indicates the condition. Several conditions are divided into subconditions to differentiate between varying types or severity of the condition. The second column classifies the condition for initiation or continuation (or both) into category 1, 2, 3, or 4. For certain conditions, the numeric classification does not adequately capture the recommendation; in these cases, the third column clarifies the numeric category. These clarifications were determined during the discussions of the scientific evidence and are considered a necessary element of the recommendation. The third column also summarizes the evidence for the recommendation if evidence exists. The recommendations for which no evidence is cited are based on expert opinion from either the World Health Organization (WHO) or U.S. expert meeting in which these recommendations were developed, and might be based on evidence from sources other than systematic reviews. For certain recommendations, additional comments appear in the third column and generally come from the WHO meeting or the U.S. meeting.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations for Use of Contraceptive Methods</span></strong></p>
<p>The classifications for whether women with certain medical conditions or characteristics can use specific contraceptive methods are provided in several appendices in the original guideline document for the following contraceptive methods:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD) and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (Appendix B) </li>
    <li>Progestin-only contraceptives (POCs), including etonogestrel implants, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, and progestin-only pills (Appendix C) </li>
    <li>Combined hormonal contraceptive (CHCs), including low-dose (containing &le;35 &mu;g ethinyl estradiol) combined oral contraceptives (COCs), combined hormonal patch, and combined vaginal ring (Appendix D) </li>
    <li>Barrier contraceptive methods, including male and female condoms, spermicides, diaphragm with spermicide, and cervical cap (Appendix E) </li>
    <li>Fertility awareness&ndash;based methods (Appendix F) </li>
    <li>Lactational amenorrhea method (Appendix G) </li>
    <li>Coitus interruptus (Appendix H) </li>
    <li>Female and male sterilization (Appendix I) </li>
    <li>Emergency contraception, including emergency use of the copper-containing IUD and emergency contraceptive pills (Appendix J) </li>
</ul>
<p>A table at the end of the original guideline document summarizes the classifications for the hormonal and intrauterine methods (Appendix K).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contraceptive Method Choice</span></strong></p>
<p>Many elements need to be considered by women, men, or couples at any given point in their lifetimes when choosing the most appropriate contraceptive method. These elements include safety, effectiveness, availability (including accessibility and affordability), and acceptability. The guidance in this report focuses primarily on the safety of a given contraceptive method for a person with a particular characteristic or medical condition. Therefore, the classification of category 1 means that the method can be used in that circumstance with no restrictions with regard to safety but does not necessarily imply that the method is the best choice for that person; other factors, such as effectiveness, availability, and acceptability, might play an important role in determining the most appropriate choice. Voluntary informed choice of contraceptive methods is an essential guiding principle, and contraceptive counseling, when applicable, might be an important contributor to the successful use of contraceptive methods.</p>
<p>In choosing a method of contraception, dual protection from the simultaneous risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) also should be considered. Although hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy, they do not protect against STDs, including HIV. Consistent and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for HIV infection and other STDs, including chlamydial infection, gonococcal infection, and trichomoniasis. Although evidence is limited, use of female condoms can provide protection from acquisition and transmission of STDs. All patients, regardless of contraceptive choice, should be counseled about the use of condoms and the risk for STDs, including HIV infection. Additional information about prevention and treatment of STDs is available from the CDC's <em>Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines</em> (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment" title="CDC STD Web site" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment</a>).</p></div>

<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>Since publication of <em>U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2010</em> (U.S. MEC 2010), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has monitored the literature for new evidence relevant to the recommendations through the World Health Organization (WHO)/CDC continuous identification of research evidence (CIRE) system. This system identifies new evidence as it is published and allows WHO and CDC to update systematic reviews and facilitate updates to recommendations as new evidence warrants. Automated searches are run in PubMed weekly, and the results are reviewed. Abstracts that meet specific criteria are added to the Web-based CIRE system, which facilitates coordination and peer review of systematic reviews for both WHO and CDC.</p>
<p>CDC staff members and other invited authors conducted independent systematic reviews for each of the topics being considered for U.S. MEC 2016. The purpose of these systematic reviews was to identify direct evidence about the safety of contraceptive method use by women with selected conditions (e.g., risk for disease progression or other adverse health effects in women with multiple sclerosis who use combined hormonal contraceptives [CHCs]). The full reviews appear in the published literature and contain the details of each review, including the systematic review question, literature search protocol, inclusion and exclusion criteria, evidence tables, and quality assessments (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). CDC staff continued to monitor new evidence identified through the CIRE system during the preparation for the August 2015 meeting.</p></div>

<div class="content_para"><p>In preparation for an expert meeting held during August 26 to 28, 2015, to review the scientific evidence for potential recommendations, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff members and other invited authors conducted independent systematic reviews for each of the topics being considered. The purpose of these systematic reviews was to identify direct evidence about the safety of contraceptive method use by women with selected conditions (e.g., risk for disease progression or other adverse health effects in women with multiple sclerosis who use combined hormonal contraceptives [CHCs]). Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for reporting systematic reviews, and strength and quality of the evidence were assigned using the system of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). When direct evidence was limited or not available, indirect evidence (e.g., evidence on surrogate outcomes or among healthy women) and theoretical issues were considered and either added to direct evidence within a systematic review or separately compiled for presentation to the meeting participants. Completed systematic reviews were peer reviewed by two or three experts and then provided to participants before the expert meeting. Reviews are referenced and cited throughout the original guideline document; the full reviews appear in the published literature and contain the details of each review, including the systematic review question, literature search protocol, inclusion and exclusion criteria, evidence tables, and quality assessments (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

<div class="content_para"><p>During August 27&ndash;28, 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) held a meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, of 11 family planning experts and representatives from partner organizations to solicit their input on the scope of and process for updating both <em>U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use</em> (U.S. MEC) 2010 and <em>U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use</em> (U.S. SPR) 2013. The participants were experts in family planning and represented various types of health care providers, as well as health care provider organizations. A list of participants is provided at the end of the original guideline document. Meeting participants discussed topics to be addressed in the update of U.S. MEC based on new evidence published since 2010 (identified through the continuous identification of research evidence [CIRE] system), topics addressed at a 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) meeting to update global guidance, and suggestions CDC received from health care providers for the addition of recommendations for women with medical conditions not yet included in U.S. MEC (e.g., from provider feedback through e-mail, public inquiry, and questions received at conferences). CDC identified several topics to consider when updating the guidance, including revision of existing recommendations for certain medical conditions or characteristics (breastfeeding, postpartum, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], receiving antiretroviral therapy, obesity, dyslipidemia, increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), superficial venous thrombosis, gestational trophoblastic disease, and migraine headaches), addition of recommendations for new medical conditions (cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, use of certain psychotropic drugs, and St. John's wort), and addition of recommendations for new contraceptive methods (ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception). CDC determined that all other recommendations in U.S. MEC 2010 were up to date and consistent with the existing body of evidence for that recommendation.</p>
<p>During August 26&ndash;28, 2015, in Atlanta, Georgia, CDC held a meeting with 44 participants who were invited to provide their individual perspectives on the scientific evidence presented and potential recommendations. Twenty-nine of the participants represented a wide range of expertise in family planning provision and research, and included obstetricians/gynecologists, pediatricians, family physicians, nurse practitioners, epidemiologists, and others with research and clinical practice expertise in contraceptive safety, effectiveness, and management; these individuals participated in the entire meeting. Fifteen participants with expertise relevant to specific topics on the meeting agenda provided information and participated in the discussion (e.g., an expert in cystic fibrosis was asked to provide general information about the condition and to assist in interpreting the evidence and any theoretical concerns on the use of contraceptive methods in women with the condition); these participants provided input only during the session for which their topics were discussed. Lists of participants and any potential conflicts of interest are provided at the end of the original guideline document. During the meeting, the evidence from the systematic review for each topic was presented, including direct evidence and any indirect evidence or theoretical concerns. Participants provided their perspectives on using the evidence to develop recommendations that would meet the needs of U.S. health care providers. After the meeting, CDC determined the recommendations, taking into consideration the perspectives provided by the meeting participants.</p></div>
