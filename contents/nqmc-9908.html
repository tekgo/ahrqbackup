<h3>
Rationale
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The intent of the measure is to reduce the frequency of vascular access-related complications and improve patient survival by promoting arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and/or arteriovenous graft (AVG) placement and discouraging central venous catheter (CVC) use. </p>
<p>Research has clearly and consistently illustrated the net benefit of the use of permanent vascular access types over central venous catheters; studies cited demonstrate a graded morbidity and mortality risk dependent on vascular access type in hemodialysis patients, with catheters carrying the highest risk, followed by AV grafts, then AVFs. </p>
<p>As noted in the Kidney Dialysis Outcome and Quality Initiative's (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines and Recommendations for Vascular Access (National Kidney Foundation, 2006), AVFs are preferred over all other forms of access because of their functional advantages and lower complications rates. Specifically, AVFs have the lowest rate of thrombosis (Perera et al., 2004) and require the fewest interventions (Perera et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2003), and thus provide longer survival of the access (Perera et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2003; Pisoni et al., 2002; Mehta, 1991). The number of access events is three- to seven-fold greater in prosthetic bridge grafts than in native AVFs (Perera et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2003; Mehta, 1991). As a result, costs of implantation and access maintenance are the lowest for AVFs (Mehta, 1991; National Institutes of Health [NIH] &amp; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [NIDDKD], 1995; Egger &amp; Milam, 2001). Moreover, vascular access infections in hemodialysis patients are common, can be severe, and contribute to infection being the second leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 (Gulati et al., 2003). AVFs have been demonstrated to have lower rates of infection than grafts, which, in turn, are less prone to infection than percutaneous catheters and subcutaneous port catheter systems (Nassar &amp; Ayus, 2001). Consequently, AVFs are associated with increased survival and lower hospitalization rates than either AVGs or catheters (Dhingra et al., 2001). Research indicates that patients dialyzed via catheters and grafts have a greater mortality risk (relative risk = 2.3 and 1.47, respectively) than patients dialyzed with AVFs (Dhingra et al., 2001), and epidemiological evidence confirms that greater use of AVFs reduces morbidity and mortality (Dhingra et al., 2001; Woods &amp; Port, 1997; Xue et al., 2003; Polkinghorne et al., 2004). </p></div>

Extent of Measure Testing
</h3>
<div class='FieldValue'>
<div class="content_para"><p>The Kidney Care Quality Alliance (KCQA) Vascular Access Measure was tested for reliability, validity, and feasibility at both dialysis facilities and within physician offices. </p>
<p><strong>Facility Testing</strong><br />
KCQA tested its end-stage renal disease (ESRD) measures through a one-year prospective cohort study on a nationally drawn sample of 53 dialysis facilities containing a mix of for-profit and not-for-profit providers; hospital-affiliated and freestanding facilities within large, small, and independent dialysis organizations; urban, suburban, and rural settings; and facilities both with and without electronic health records (EHRs). Facility samples were structured to be generally representative of the national industry profile as identified by the United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) 2007 Annual Data Report. </p>
<p>Approximately 25 patients per facility were sought, resulting in a final sample size of 1,115 patients. Of these, 1,057 were hemodialysis patients and were thus included in the vascular access measures' denominator populations. Patient samples were structured to be generally representative of the national industry profile as identified by the USRDS 2007 Annual Data Report. </p>
<p>Following the data collection period, on-site data-integrity audits were performed at 11 of the 53 facilities (21%). Audit sites were selected to provide a cross-section of facilities reflective of the sample profile. Selection criteria included geographic location, facility type (e.g., for-profit vs. not-for-profit, urban vs. rural), and EHR use. Pertinent data were re-abstracted from the patients' medical records and were compared to the information submitted by the facility throughout the pilot to assess the measure's reliability.</p>
<p>Inter-rater reliability was assessed during the on-site audits through a direct comparison of data submitted by the facilities throughout the pilot to data re-abstracted by the auditor(s). Reliability was quantitatively summarized using Cohen's Kappa with confidence intervals. The resulting Kappa statistic for the Functional AVF or Evaluation by Vascular Surgeon for Placement Measure was found to be 0.8880 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.7484 to 1.000. Based on the literature, this value indicates "almost perfect agreement" and excellent reproducibility for the measure. In addition to the Kappa value, the percent agreement between the auditor and facility abstractors (i.e., the reliability percentage) was calculated and was found to be excellent at 96.9%. These two values demonstrate that the KCQA measure is reliable.</p>
<p><strong>Physician Office Testing</strong><br />
To test the measure in physician offices, Kidney Care Partners (KCP) contracted with the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care (IFMC) to perform on-site testing at four nephrology practice sites distributed geographically across the United States (Iowa, Nevada, Texas, and Pennsylvania) of various practice sizes (5.25 to 62 physicians), and medical record types (two EHR, one paper but by the time of visit transitioning to EHR, and one hybrid). </p>
<p>Each site was asked to pull in advance the records of the first 35 adult hemodialysis patients seen on or after July 1, 2007; IFMC requested an oversample of five patients per site in an effort to ensure a remaining sample of 30 patients. The facilities within which the sample patients received care were asked to pull the records in advance of the IFMC visit because had previously identified the need for both patient's physician office and dialysis organization records to collect necessary data elements. Physician offices were, therefore, requested to secure copies of the necessary facility records in advance of the IFMC visit.</p>
<p>The four nephrology office sites were visited by a two-person IFMC abstractor team to conduct reliability testing. Using the KCQA data collection tool, the two abstractors individually abstracted each medical record, compared the results, and evaluated the mismatches. Mismatch codes, previously developed by IFMC for reliability testing of project abstraction, were used to classify the reason determined for each mismatch. </p>
<p>Inter-rater reliability was also assessed by IFMC in the physician office setting. As in the facility setting, the resulting Kappa statistic indicates excellent reproducibility at 0.9152 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.8349 to 0.9964. </p></div>
